## 🎓 **INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY & EDUCATION**

### Long-Term Investment Principles
**Dollar Cost Averaging**
- Consistent buying regardless of market conditions
- "Why would you ever sell?" - showing chart of market long-term performance
- Missing rebounds worse than riding dips

**Market Timing Warning**
- "No one has lost more money than people who short the market"
- "Second one is those who try to time the top and buy the bottom"
- April example: People sold during dip, missed entire recovery trying to find bottom

**Portfolio Structure**
- Small portion for active day trading
- Majority in "boring long-term" investments
- If day trading capital went to zero, wouldn't be financially crippled
- 100% automatic dividend reinvestment

### Mortgage/Investment Advice
**Refinancing Analysis (6.37% to 6%)**
- **Against refinancing** for such small decrease
- **Reason**: Lost interest payments don't carry over (lose 95% of each payment made)
- Example: $500k house = $30-40k/year in interest lost
- **Closing costs**: ~$14k each time
- **Alternative strategy**: Pay $14k directly to principal instead
  - Reduces interest on that $14k going forward
  - Maintains optionality if rates drop further
- **Rate outlook**: Fed cutting 2+ more times, 10-year treasury cooling
- Exception: If strongly believe rates going up, lock in now

### Options Strategy
- Uses LEAPs for leverage while preserving capital
- Example: Instead of $10k in shares with $500 max loss (5% stop)
  - Buy 1 LEAP for $500
  - Same max loss, potentially more upside
  - Frees $9,500 for other opportunities

### Work-Life Balance Philosophy
- **Moderation theme**: Balance between Dave Ramsey's "starvation" and reckless spending
- **Buying time**: Most valuable thing wealthy people can purchase
- **Side hustles**: Emphasized opportunities in service-based businesses
- Criticized extreme frugality at expense of life enjoyment
- "What if you get hit by drunk driver? Money won't matter if you wasted your healthy years"

### Course Sellers & Education
**Strong Anti-Course Stance**
- "Scammers" who claim to have "figured out the secret"
- Live streaming exposes reality vs. curated screenshots
- "If you want to get rich, lie to people who want to be lied to"
- "If you want to make a living, tell the truth to people who want to hear the truth"
- "If you want to go broke, tell the truth to people who want to be lied to"

**Morning Call Service**
- Only offering: News aggregation and analysis ($0.75/day)
- Not proprietary information - all publicly available
- Alternative to spending 2.5 hours + $1,000/month on paywalled sources
- Explicitly NOT a signal service
- Could do educational course on definitions (not strategies) but ADHD prevents follow-through

---

## 🎯 **TRADING METHODOLOGY & PERFORMANCE**

### Information Sources
- Bloomberg Terminal data (slight delay acceptable)
- Does NOT need microsecond advantage
- Focuses on momentum after initial move
- Not trading hundreds of billions where microseconds matter

### Risk Management
- Systematic stop losses (1-6% trailing depending on position)
- "Legging in" strategy - building positions gradually
- Day trades almost entirely shares, not options
- Options for longer-term leverage plays

### Day Trading Results (October 28)
- **Up 9% on the day**
- Multiple successful exits: PayPal calls, RMBS, DPRO bottom-catch
- Mixed results: JetBlue initially down but recovered
- Conservative capital deployment ahead of FOMC

### Historical Wins Referenced
- **Wolf calls**: 1000% on 90% of position (10% went to zero)
- **Beyond Meat**: Put position profitable despite ridicule
- **Ford**: Massive dividend collection over three quarters (entered despite mockery)

### Community Fundraiser Mentioned
- Previous year: Paid off school lunch debt personally
- This year: Planning community fundraiser for school lunches given shutdown/SNAP concerns

## 🌍 **CHINA INFLUENCER LAW - MARKET IMPLICATIONS**

### New Regulation
**Requirement**: University degree required to discuss "serious topics" as influencer
- **Fine**: 100,001 yuan for violations
- **Scope**: Economics, politics, policy, etc.

### Market Philosophy Discussion
**Two-Sided Analysis**
1. **Pro-Regulation View**: Stops unqualified people from spreading misinformation
2. **Anti-Regulation View**: Government controlling who can speak on what topics

**Personal Take**
- Problem is audience, not speaker
- 17-year-old shouldn't be your economic advisor
- Government-funded education doesn't guarantee better information
- Professors teaching 20-year-old material vs. real-time market participants
- Mechanic analogy: 25 years experience > Auto Institute degree

**American Implications**
- Rise of independent content creators = "key to real information"
- Legacy media had monopoly on misinformation for 100 years
- Now have options, but requires personal fact-checking
- April "empty ports" example: People parroted without understanding
  - Ports not empty, just reduced traffic on West Coast only
  - "Store shelves empty in 2 weeks" - China provides <5% of US food (Canada/Mexico primary)

**Free Speech Stance**
- Against government speech control in any form
- Criticized Trump press restrictions
- Criticized this Chinese law
- "Same shit, different wrapper"
- Mainstream media "knows it's over for them" - losing stranglehold

## 🎮 **PERSONAL & STREAM CONTEXT**

### Pet Health Crisis
- Bayo (dog, age 7) - cancer specialist appointment during stream
- Lymphoma diagnosis - waiting on T-cell or B-cell determination
- Treatment plan dependent on cell type

**School Experience**
- Aced tests, never did homework
- 6-month projects done night before
- Science project example: Grabbed flowers at midnight, got a D

**Parenting Approach**
- Daughter has ADHD more than son
- Teaching focus techniques vs. medication-first approach
- Personal history: Lack of stimulation as child, now hyper-focused on finance/economics
- Daughter can explain evaporation/precipitation but can't write a "J"

**Criticism of Self-Diagnosis Culture**
- People claiming ADHD/OCD without understanding conditions
- "Wanting Adderall prescription doesn't mean you have ADHD"
- Minimizes real struggles when used casually

### Portfolio Monitoring
- Doesn't actively watch Chase account
- Discovers positions months/years later
- Found class action lawsuit paperwork too late to claim
- Mail checked every 2 weeks
- Desk cleared revealed 6-month-old pile
