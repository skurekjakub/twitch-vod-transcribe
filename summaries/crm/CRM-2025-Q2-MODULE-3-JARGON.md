## TERM FREQUENCY & EMPHASIS

### Most Frequently Mentioned Technical Terms (by repetition):

1. **Agent / AgentForce / Agentic** - Mentioned 50+ times (dominant theme)
2. **Data Cloud** - Mentioned 15+ times (strategic anchor)
3. **AI** - Mentioned 10+ times
4. **Slack** - Mentioned 8+ times
5. **Metadata** - Mentioned 5+ times

### Terms Introduced as "New" This Quarter:

- **Agentic Enterprise** (new framing)
- **AgentForce version 4** (upcoming product)
- **Agentic IT Service** (new product category)
- **Flex Credits** (new pricing model)
- **Digital Labor** (new terminology for automation)

---

## NOTABLE TECHNICAL OMISSIONS

### Terms NOT Mentioned (Surprising Given Context):

1. **Generative AI / GenAI** - Not used (prefer "agentic")
2. **Machine Learning / ML** - Not mentioned
3. **Prompt Engineering** - Not discussed
4. **Hallucination** - Not addressed (AI accuracy concern)
5. **Model Training / Fine-Tuning** - Not mentioned
6. **OpenAI / GPT / Anthropic Claude** - Mentioned for Dreamforce but not for technical integration
7. **Vector Database** - Not mentioned (despite being core to Data Cloud likely)
8. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Not mentioned (despite being core to agent accuracy)

**Interpretation:**  
Management is deliberately using business-friendly language ("agentic," "digital labor") rather than technical AI jargon. This suggests a focus on outcomes and use cases rather than underlying technology - a smart positioning for enterprise sales.

## JARGON EVOLUTION

### From Prior Quarters → This Quarter:

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| "AI-powered" | "Agentic" |
| "Automation" | "Digital Labor" |
| "Copilot" / "Assistant" | "Agent" (autonomous, not just assistive) |
| "Einstein" (Salesforce's AI brand) | "AgentForce" (new platform brand) |

This rebranding signals a **strategic pivot** from AI as a feature to AI as a platform transformation.
