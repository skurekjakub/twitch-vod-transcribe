## 2.2. Cultural & Contextual References

### Japanese Grammatical Terminology

- **格助詞 (Kakujoshi):** The Japanese linguistic term for "case-marking particles." The instructor notes this term is less useful for learners unfamiliar with grammatical case, preferring the term "logical particles" for pedagogical clarity.

### Self-Introduction Conventions

- **Self-introduction formality:** The instructor demonstrates that beginning a self-introduction with "watashi wa" can add unnecessary emphasis. In context, simply stating one's identity (e.g., "KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu") is more natural and appropriate. This reflects the Japanese cultural tendency toward economy of expression and context-dependent speech.

### Course Materials Referenced

- **Unlocking Japanese:** The companion course book mentioned by the instructor, available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle formats. Designed to accompany this video lesson series.

### Linguistic Philosophy

- **Organic Japanese Approach:** The teaching methodology emphasizes understanding the underlying structural logic of Japanese rather than memorizing rules. The approach treats Japanese as a logical, straightforward language when understood through its native structure rather than through English-centric explanations.

### Greeting Expressions Used

- **Kore kara yoroshiku onegai shimasu (これからよろしくお願いします):** A formal expression used at the end of the lesson meaning "I look forward to our continued relationship" or "Please treat me well from now on." Culturally appropriate for establishing ongoing teacher-student or professional relationships.
