## 6.1. Analytical Exercises (Implicit)

While the video does not provide explicit practice drills, the instructor's teaching method suggests the following analytical exercises for learners:

### Exercise 1: Sentence Structure Analysis

**Activity Type:** Structural analysis

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify:
1. The topic (は-marked element), if any
2. The logical subject (が-marked element, visible or invisible)
3. The complete logical sentence (comment)

**Practice Sentences from the Video:**

| Sentence | Topic (は) | Logical Subject (が) | Predicate/Comment |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 土曜日は東京に行きます | 土曜日 | ø (implied "I") | 東京に行きます |
| 東京は土曜日に行きます | 東京 | ø (implied "I") | 土曜日に行きます |
| 私はさくらです | 私 | ø (implied "I") | さくらです |
| 私がさくらです | — | 私 | さくらです |
| さくらです | — | ø (implied subject) | さくらです |

### Exercise 2: Topic Switching Practice

**Activity Type:** Transformation drill

**Instructions:** Take the same logical action and create different sentences by changing the topic.

**Example Pattern:**

Base action: 私は土曜日に東京に行きます (I go to Tokyo on Saturday)

Transform by making different elements the topic:

1. **Saturday as topic:**
   - 土曜日は東京に行きます
   - "As for Saturday, I'm going to Tokyo"

2. **Tokyo as topic:**
   - 東京は土曜日に行きます
   - "As for Tokyo, I'm going there on Saturday"

3. **I as topic:**
   - 私は土曜日に東京に行きます
   - "As for me, I'm going to Tokyo on Saturday"

**Learner Practice:** Create your own base sentence and practice shifting the topic.

### Exercise 3: Identifying the Zero Pronoun

**Activity Type:** Gap identification

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify where the zero pronoun (ø) exists and what it likely refers to based on context.

**Practice Items:**

1. KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu.
   - Full analysis: ø が KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu
   - ø refers to: The speaker (Cure Dolly)

2. 東京に行きます。
   - Full analysis: ø が 東京に行きます
   - ø refers to: _____________ (context-dependent)

3. さくらです。
   - Full analysis: ø が さくらです
   - ø refers to: _____________ (context-dependent)

### Exercise 4: Wa vs. Ga Distinction

**Activity Type:** Comprehension check

**Instructions:** Determine whether changing the particle would change the *logic* of the sentence or only the *focus/emphasis*.

**Question Set:**

1. If we change 土曜日**は**東京に行きます to 土曜日**に**東京に行きます:
   - Does the logical meaning change? **No** (same action occurs)
   - What changes? **Focus shifts; 土曜日 is no longer the topic**

2. If we change 私**が**メアリーをキスしました to メアリー**が**私をキスしました:
   - Does the logical meaning change? **Yes** (who kissed whom changes)
   - What changes? **The doer and receiver of the action swap**

## 6.2. Suggested Self-Study Activities

Based on the lesson content, learners should:

### Sentence Parsing Practice
- Take Japanese sentences and bracket/label: [Topic は] + [ø が + Predicate]
- Practice until the topic-comment structure becomes intuitive

### Translation Comparison
- Translate sentences three ways:
  1. With ø only: さくらです
  2. With は: 私はさくらです
  3. With が: 私がさくらです
- Note the subtle differences in English meaning/emphasis

### Reading Exercise
- When reading Japanese, consciously identify:
  - Which element is the topic (は)
  - Which element is the logical subject (が, visible or invisible)
  - What is the actual action/state being described

## 6.3. Comprehension Questions

**Based on the Video Content:**

1. What does the instructor mean by "logical particle"?
   - *Answer: A particle that tells us the logic of the sentence—who is doing what to whom*

2. Why does the instructor prefer the term "logical particles" over "case-marking particles" (格助詞)?
   - *Answer: Because "logical particles" is more useful for learners unfamiliar with the concept of grammatical case*

3. What is the "zero pronoun" and why is it important?
   - *Answer: The implied, invisible subject that grammatically exists in every Japanese sentence, marked by an invisible が*

4. If two sentences describe the same action but have different は-marked topics, what changes and what stays the same?
   - *Answer: The logical meaning (what happens) stays the same; only the topic/focus changes*

5. Why doesn't the instructor say "watashi wa" when introducing herself?
   - *Answer: In context, it's unnecessary and would add unintended emphasis*

*Note: This lesson is primarily explanatory rather than drill-based. The instructor recommends the companion book "Unlocking Japanese" for additional practice materials.*
