# Module 6: Significant Tangents & Anecdotes

## The PostRank Launch Crisis: Three Days Without Sleep

**Topic**: Technical scaling challenges during product launch

Ilia recounts the chaotic launch of PostRank on July 8th: "I still remember the day it was like July 8th when I released And then I didn't sleep for 3 days because the servers were melting down. Not strictly because it was like such huge demand although there was. It was also because my code was terrible."

The solution was brute force rather than elegance: "Kind of like brute force just throw more servers at the problem and then eventually you know optimize it out over the next couple of weeks to to get it back to a manageable set."

This anecdote illustrates that successful products can launch with imperfect code, and that scaling problems are often good problems to have. The story also shows humility about technical skill at that career stage.

## The Train Ride Acquisition Conversation

**Topic**: How casual major business conversations can be

Ilia describes the origin of Google's acquisition interest: "We were presenting at one of the conferences in the Bay Area and you know we got off stage and uh Phil Moody who was one who was the uh kind of lead PM on Google Analytics kind of walked up to us and like hey this this is cool uh do you want to have a chat?"

The follow-up was remarkably informal: "I remember taking a train from San Francisco to Mountain View later that day, sitting in the conference room and him basically interrogating us about what is it that you build and then um ending the conversation with, hey, maybe we should do something together."

The anecdote demystifies acquisition conversations—they can start as casually as "want to have a chat?" after a conference presentation, rather than formal business development processes.

## Reading Internal Google Design Documents

**Topic**: The gap between published research and internal implementation

When Ilia joined Google after the acquisition, he was fascinated by internal documentation: "I remember building Post rank and reading papers that were published about Bigtable this and Hadoop that and like trying to figure out how to replicate some of the magic that Google had and then I'm reading the internal design documents and I'm like oh my god this is three generations ahead of this paper that I was reading."

His frustration with knowledge hoarding: "This is amazing right? Like I wish the world knew about this right? And then I would half the time I would talk to the engineers. I'm like, 'How come we never published a follow-up on this thing?' They're like, 'We're too busy.' It's not that it's a trade secret. We're literally too damn busy."

This story reveals how cutting-edge companies often have knowledge far ahead of public understanding, not because of secrecy but because publishing takes time engineers don't have.

## The Exabyte Data Pipeline Conversation

**Topic**: Scale shock when moving from startup to internet-scale infrastructure

Ilia describes his introduction to Google Analytics scale: "To to make a modification to a data pipeline I remember the conversations fondly um like sitting with our SR team and they're like okay well you're going to at this bit field right here. That's going to be this number of exabytes of data. I'm like, 'Oh my god, okay. Uh, let me think about this more carefully, right?'"

The contrast: "We went from managing tens of thousands of analytics accounts and granted yes we were crawling the web at a fairly large scale to operating in a service that was literally executing on half more than half the internet."

This anecdote illustrates the dramatic shift in mindset required when acquired companies integrate into tech giants. Decisions that were straightforward at startup scale require completely different thinking at internet scale.

## The Make the Web Fast Radio Tower Experiments

**Topic**: Unconventional approaches to internet performance

Ilia describes some of the wild projects in Google's "Make the Web Fast" group: "Within that group, we had all kinds of fun projects. We literally built radio towers trying to figure out how to build more effective cellular networks. Uh you know, dug trenches built built towers."

Other experiments included: "We worked on TCP IP and trying to figure out how to reduce congestion. Uh we worked at optimizing proxies for hey, turns out that most humans write terrible websites. Could we just like optimize it out kind of dynamically as a web server plugin."

The story shows how a broad mandate ("make the internet fast") can lead to attacking the problem from multiple angles simultaneously—from physical infrastructure to network protocols to software optimization.

## The 15 Marketing Books Week

**Topic**: Rapid skill acquisition through immersive learning

Ilia shares a specific example of building 80% competence quickly: "I literally remember going on Amazon and I bought 15 books on marketing and I spent a week nothing but reading marketing books so I could understand the lexicon, the jargon and and speak the right words when I talk to marketing teams."

This wasn't about becoming a marketer—it was about translation: "I'm able to converse with our marketing team because you know what? I took the time... I'm also adept enough at uh working with our PR teams because like I've written a lot, right? And I've practiced that muscle. I'm also an engineer. So I now I'm able to bridge."

The anecdote provides a concrete template for skill acquisition: identify the domain you need to understand, find comprehensive resources, dedicate focused time to absorption.

## Waterloo Students Trying and Rejecting Wall Street

**Topic**: The value of exploration in discovering fit

Ilia describes seeing peers' journeys through co-op: "I had so many of my peers going through university where we all started with some preconceived notion of what we wanted to do. was like, 'Oh, I really want to go to Wall Street and work there.' And they they try one of the co-op terms there. And they're like, 'No, actually like this for whatever reason.' Mean like I don't like the city or I don't like the industry. I didn't like the people. It like it just didn't click for whatever reason."

The key benefit: discovering mismatches early, during 3-month stints that don't carry career stigma, rather than after committing to full-time roles post-graduation.

## The Graduate School Deferral That Became Permanent

**Topic**: How short-term deferrals can become permanent pivots

Ilia was accepted to University of Toronto for graduate school but had PostRank projects: "I'm looking at that syllabus. I'm like what are the courses I'm most interested in and I go through the list and it was like the the ones that immediately stood out to me about like entpreneurship and like how to do a company. I'm like wait a second. So, I could go and learn about this stuff academically and read books or I can like I'm literally having the conversations right now with the investors."

His negotiation: "Which uh led me to reaching out to my adviser and basically asking hey can I take a a year time out you know I was planning to do this this year but how about I start next year and hemmed in hot and said okay I understand and you know come back to me in 6 months."

The resolution: "Um to close that story, we did end up closing the round and that became postrank the company and uh I never did get to finish my uh so-called graduate degree."

The story illustrates how keeping options open (deferral vs. rejection) can ease decision-making, even if the deferred path ultimately never happens.

## Running Away from High School Public Speaking

**Topic**: Dramatic fear transformation through context shift

Ilia shares his early fear: "Going through high school, I was deathly afraid of public speaking. I would run away from class to avoid it. Right? Like I I vividly remember those stories."

He continued struggling through university: "Even through university like I had cold sweats standing out in front of a class trying to explain the thing."

The contrast with entrepreneurship: "But I was totally adept and fine when I was pitching uh my product to an audience."

The revelation: "The difference is in one hand I I was trying to describe a thing that you know I didn't have any particular investment in it was a test of my knowledge versus here's a thing I'm passionate about and I want to like enact change in the ecosystem to move it to some new direction."

If told early that public speaking would become his job: "If you told me uh early in my college career that my future holds public speaking, I would I don't know what I would do. I would say that you're crazy."

This personal story illustrates that many "weaknesses" are context-dependent rather than fundamental personality traits.

## Embarrassing Early Code on GitHub

**Topic**: The natural progression from bad work to good work

Ilia reflects on looking back at early projects: "Or frankly, if I go on GitHub and look at my own projects, like it is embarrassing code. But you know what? It was the limit of my ability at the time when I did it. And I'm so glad that I did it, right? Because it was those milestones like putting that work out there that gave me the right feedback, gave me the right encouragement that then led me to improve."

The broader point: Early work being embarrassing in retrospect is evidence of growth, not reason for regret. The key is that you published it anyway and got feedback that enabled improvement.

## Managers Admitting Happiness at Lower Levels

**Topic**: Private reflections on career trajectory

Ilia shares observations from informal conversations: "When I talk to a lot of managers in like high roles, directors and all the rest, you know, after you sit at a bar and and have a couple of drinks, they're like you reflect back on what was when were you happiest in your career? They say, 'Huh, you know, it was a couple years back before I became an ex because I had like I was really competent at that thing and I was loving it, but I was told that in order for me to like grow quote unquote, I needed to take on this other thing.'"

The reflection continues: "At the same time they will reflect and say but I've also learned a lot in this new role I appreciate what it means to run a team the complexity the interpersonal dynamics the performance management and all the rest and that's an amazing tool to have in your toolkit."

This anecdote reveals the private doubts many successful managers have about whether advancement meant progress, and supports Ilia's argument that management should be viewed as a temporary capability-building phase rather than permanent identity.

## The Newsletter Growth Filtering Problem

**Topic**: How growing audience changes creator behavior

Ryan shares his personal experience: "I think there was uh there's a year or two where I was writing a newsletter and every week I'd publish something and at some point the email list is growing and it's growing and I could tell at the beginning when I'm ideulating what am I going to write this week a lot more nos coming in my mind I go oh no this one this topic's not good I've seen this somewhere."

This tangent validates Ilia's point about success creating filters, with Ryan providing confirmation from his own content creation experience. The growing audience unconsciously raised his internal bar for what was "good enough" to publish, reducing his output.

## The Sorting 10 Items Array Example

**Topic**: When theoretical knowledge doesn't matter

Ilia describes pragmatic engineering learning: "Turns out this didn't work or that particular solution worked or we had to solve it under these constraints and the whole big old thing was an issue because I was like sorting 10 items in an array. Who cares, right? It's like pragmatic engineering."

This brief example illustrates the gap between academic optimization (choosing the perfect sorting algorithm based on big-O notation) and real-world engineering (it doesn't matter which algorithm you use for 10 items). Understanding this distinction is part of practical engineering judgment that co-op experiences develop.

## Meeting People at Every Level Without Introduction

**Topic**: Google's open culture

Ilia loved Google's accessibility: "Google is an open culture which is the thing that I loved about Google And I could approach anyone and everyone about um any piece of infrastructure, any product."

He leveraged this extensively: "I was spending every free moment of time just like diving deep into various design documents and wikis."

This tangent about Google's internal culture explains why the company was such a good fit for his learning style and curiosity-driven approach. The open access to information and people enabled rapid skill building across diverse technical domains.

## The Google vs. Facebook Social War Context

**Topic**: Competitive dynamics driving acquisition strategy

Ilia explains the timing of PostRank's acquisition: "This is right in the time span when Google and Facebook were uh like at war in terms of drawing the battle lines for social. Uh this is when Google woke up to the fact that Facebook is on a runaway trajectory and um all hands on deck."

Google's response: "This is when Google starts working on Google+. Uh which of course has since been sunset."

The acquisition strategy: "They were looking for all the help that they could get and all the experience that they could acquire to speedrun this whole thing."

This tangent provides important business context for why acquisitions happen and how competitive dynamics drive "all hands on deck" moments that create acquisition opportunities. It also shows how even well-resourced initiatives (Google+) can fail despite massive investment.
