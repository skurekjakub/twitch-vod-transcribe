## 2.1. Primary Learning Objectives & Topics

The following language skills, grammar points, and thematic concepts were the primary focus of this lesson:

- Understanding the fundamental two-part structure of all Japanese sentences
- Learning the Japanese grammatical terms 主語 (shugo/subject) and 述語 (jutsugo/predicate)
- Mastering the core function of the が (ga) particle as the subject marker
- Understanding the concept of the "logical が (ga)" – the invisible but always-present subject marker
- Recognizing that all other sentence elements modify either the subject (shugo) or predicate (jutsugo)
- Distinguishing between surface structure (what appears in writing/speech) and logical structure (underlying grammar)
- Introduction to the concept that は (wa) interacts with が (ga) in ways that will be explained in subsequent lessons

## 2.2. Cultural & Contextual References

### Grammatical Terminology References

- **主語 (shugo):** The Japanese grammatical term for "subject" – the thing that is doing or being something in a sentence. Cure Dolly uses this term to establish proper Japanese linguistic vocabulary alongside English explanations, helping learners connect with native Japanese grammar concepts.

- **述語 (jutsugo):** The Japanese grammatical term for "predicate" – what the subject is doing or being. This term represents the action, state, or description portion of the sentence. Understanding this concept is essential for parsing Japanese sentences correctly.

### Pedagogical References

- **"Unlocking Japanese" (Book):** A companion resource written by the instructor, described as a short book readable in "one or two evenings" that provides comprehensive explanation of the concepts introduced in this lesson series. Mentioned as a resource for deeper understanding of Japanese structure.

- **KawaJapa:** The name of the educational channel/brand. The instructor introduces herself as "KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii" (Cure Dolly from KawaJapa), establishing the source and series context.

### Linguistic Concept References

- **Logical が (ga):** A conceptual framework introduced by Cure Dolly to explain that even when が does not appear in a sentence's surface form, it is always logically present in the underlying grammatical structure. This is a teaching device to help learners understand that Japanese sentence structure remains consistent even when particles are dropped.

- **Particle System (助詞/joshi):** Referenced as "the glue that holds Japanese together" and "the linchpins of the language." This emphasizes the critical importance of particles in Japanese grammar, distinct from languages like English that rely more heavily on word order.

### Cultural Communication Reference

- **よろしくお願いします (Yoroshiku onegai shimasu):** Used at the end of the lesson as a closing expression. This is a polite Japanese phrase with multiple contextual meanings, here used in its sense of "please treat me/this favorably" or "I look forward to your continued support," appropriate for a teacher-student relationship and ongoing lesson series.
