This section documents all practice activities, drills, or exercises presented or suggested in the video.

## Overview

This particular lesson is primarily expository and conceptual rather than practice-oriented. The instructor focuses on explaining the fundamental structure of Japanese sentences rather than providing interactive exercises or drills. However, the lesson structure itself suggests implicit practice opportunities.

## Implicit Practice: Sentence Analysis Exercise

Based on the lesson content, learners can practice the following self-directed exercise:

### Activity Type
**Sentence Structure Analysis**

### Instructions
For any Japanese sentence you encounter:
1. Identify the **主語 (shugo)** - the subject (who/what is doing or being)
2. Identify the **述語 (jutsugo)** - the predicate (what is being done or being)
3. Find the **が (ga) particle** connecting them (or note where the "logical が" would be if it's not visible)

### Practice Material from the Video

Apply this analysis to the example sentences:

| Sentence | Identify 主語 | Identify が | Identify 述語 |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 犬が走る | ? | ? | ? |
| 花が赤い | ? | ? | ? |
| うさぎがあります | ? | ? | ? |
| 鳥が飛んでいる | ? | ? | ? |
| 疲れた | ? | ? | ? |
| 私は日本人です | ? | ? | ? |

### Answers/Solutions

| Sentence | 主語 (Subject) | が (Particle) | 述語 (Predicate) |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 犬が走る | 犬 (dog) | が (visible) | 走る (runs) |
| 花が赤い | 花 (flower) | が (visible) | 赤い (is red) |
| うさぎがあります | うさぎ (rabbit) | が (visible) | あります (exists) |
| 鳥が飛んでいる | 鳥 (bird) | が (visible) | 飛んでいる (is flying) |
| 疲れた | 私 (I) - implied | が (logical/invisible) | 疲れた (became tired) |
| 私は日本人です | 私 (I) | が (logical/replaced by は) | 日本人です (am Japanese) |

## Suggested Self-Practice: Sentence Construction

### Activity Type
**Sentence Building with が**

### Instructions
Practice constructing simple Japanese sentences using the pattern:
```
[Noun] が [Verb/Adjective/State]
```

### Example Patterns to Practice

| Subject Category | が | Predicate Category | Example |
|------------------|----|--------------------|---------|
| Animal | が | Action verb | 猫が寝る (neko ga neru) - "The cat sleeps" |
| Object | が | I-adjective | 空が青い (sora ga aoi) - "The sky is blue" |
| Person | が | Existence verb | 友達がいる (tomodachi ga iru) - "There is a friend" |
| Thing | が | Te-iru form | 電話が鳴っている (denwa ga natte iru) - "The phone is ringing" |

## Interactive Element: Questions to the Audience

### Activity Type
**Comprehension Check / Q&A**

### Description
The instructor invites questions from viewers:
> "Now, if there is anything you did not understand or you wish to ask any questions, please put them in the comments below and I will answer you."

This suggests an ongoing interactive practice component through the comment section of the video series.

## Recommended Supplementary Exercise

### Activity Type
**Extended Reading Exercise**

### Instructions
The instructor recommends reading her book "Unlocking Japanese" for deeper understanding:
> "It is a short book – you can read it in one or two evenings – but it will make Japanese clearer, simpler, and more understandable for the rest of your life."

### Purpose
- Reinforce the concepts from the video
- Provide additional examples and explanations
- Build a comprehensive understanding of Japanese sentence structure

## Note on Practice Content

This lesson establishes foundational concepts that will be built upon in subsequent lessons. The instructor explicitly mentions that the next lesson will cover the は (wa) particle, which will provide the missing piece for understanding sentences like 「私は日本人です」.

True interactive practice and application exercises may be more prominent in later lessons of the series once the foundational concepts have been established.
