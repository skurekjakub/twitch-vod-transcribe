## Note on Format

This lesson is structured as an educational monologue rather than containing conversational examples or role-play dialogues. The instructor teaches concepts through direct explanation and isolated sentence examples rather than through dialogue demonstration.

For learners seeking conversational practice material, this lesson provides foundational grammatical understanding that will help in comprehending and constructing future conversations, but does not itself contain dialogue content to study.
