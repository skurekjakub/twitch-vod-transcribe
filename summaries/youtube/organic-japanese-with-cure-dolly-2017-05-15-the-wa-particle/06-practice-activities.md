## Suggested Practice Activities (Derived from Lesson Content)

### Activity 1: Identify the True Subject

**Activity Type:** Analysis Exercise

**Instructions:** For each sentence below, identify:

2. The invisible ga-marked subject (zero pronoun)
3. Whether the topic and subject refer to the same thing

**Practice Sentences:**

| Sentence | Topic (は) | Subject (が) | Same? |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 私は日本人です | | | |
| 私はうなぎです (at restaurant) | | | |
| これはペンです | | | |
| 土曜日は東京に行きます | | | |

**Answers:**

| Sentence | Topic (は) | Subject (が) | Same? |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 私は日本人です | 私 (I/me) | [Ø = I] | Yes |
| 私はうなぎです (at restaurant) | 私 (I/me) | [Ø = it (the food)] | No |

### Activity 2: Topic Shifting Practice

**Activity Type:** Transformation Exercise

**Instructions:** The following sentences have the same logical meaning but different topics. Practice understanding how changing the topic affects emphasis while the underlying meaning remains constant.

**Example Set:**
```
土曜日は東京に行きます
"As for Saturday, (I) am going to Tokyo"
→ Emphasis on Saturday as the topic

東京は土曜日に行きます  
"As for Tokyo, (I) am going on Saturday"
→ Emphasis on Tokyo as the topic
```

**Practice:** Create similar pairs by shifting the topic in these sentences:

1. Original: 月曜日は学校に行きます (Getsuyoubi wa gakkou ni ikimasu)
   - "As for Monday, (I) go to school"
   - Shift topic to 学校...

2. Original: 朝はコーヒーを飲みます (Asa wa koohii wo nomimasu)
   - "As for morning, (I) drink coffee"
   - Shift topic to コーヒー...

### Activity 3: Context Analysis

**Activity Type:** Contextual Interpretation

**Instructions:** For the sentence "私はうなぎです," explain what the ga-marked subject refers to in each of the following contexts:

1. **Context A:** You are at a restaurant. The waiter asks what everyone would like to order.
   - What does the zero pronoun refer to? ________________
   - Full meaning: ________________

2. **Context B:** Someone rushes up to you on the street and says "私はうなぎです."
   - What does the zero pronoun refer to? ________________
   - Full meaning: ________________

3. **Context C:** A group is playing a role-playing game where everyone is assigned an animal identity.
   - What does the zero pronoun refer to? ________________
   - Full meaning: ________________

**Answers:**

1. **Context A:** The zero pronoun refers to "it" (what I'm ordering). Meaning: "As for me, it's eel" / "I'll have eel."

2. **Context B:** The zero pronoun refers to "I" (the speaker). Meaning: "I am an eel" (and you'd think they're strange).

3. **Context C:** The zero pronoun refers to "I" (the speaker). Meaning: "I am (playing the role of) an eel."

### Activity 4: Sentence Structure Mapping

**Activity Type:** Structural Analysis

**Instructions:** Map each sentence to the underlying structure: [Topic は] [Subject が] [Predicate]

         [Topic] [Subject] [Predicate]
```

Based on the lesson's emphasis on prerequisite knowledge:

1. **Review the Zero Pronoun Lesson:** The instructor explicitly recommends watching the previous lesson on the zero pronoun before or after this lesson for complete understanding.

2. **Read "Unlocking Japanese":** The course textbook mentioned as a resource for internalizing these concepts.

3. **Anticipate the Next Lesson:** The instructor mentions that the next lesson will cover "ga and its associates" and explain how they determine "who is doing what to whom."
