# 10. Additional Notes & Tangents

This section documents supplementary information discussed in the lesson that doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.

## Attribution & Academic Sources

### Jay Rubin's Contribution

The instructor explicitly credits Jay Rubin-sensei for the foundational insight presented in this lesson:

> "I learned it first of all from Jay Rubin-sensei in his book 'Making Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell You'. This fact is that the wa-particle never marks the grammatical subject of a sentence."

**About the Book:**
- **Title:** Making Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell You
- **Author:** Jay Rubin
- **Significance:** Identified as the source for the key insight that wa never marks the grammatical subject
- **Note:** The instructor mentions that Rubin did NOT explicitly explain that ga is the only particle that can mark the subject—this connection is Cure Dolly's extension of Rubin's insight

### What Rubin Didn't Mention

The instructor adds an important extension to Rubin's teaching:

> "The thing he did not mention is that the reason [wa] does not and cannot mark the doer or the be-er of a sentence [is] because only one particle can ever do that and that particle is ga."

This represents Cure Dolly's own analytical contribution beyond the source material.

## Critique of Traditional Textbooks

### What Textbooks Get Right

The instructor acknowledges that textbooks aren't entirely wrong:

> "The textbooks actually don't do a very bad job of explaining the wa-particle. In fact they do quite a good one."

Specifically, textbooks correctly explain:
- That wa marks the "topic" of a sentence
- That wa can be translated as "as for" or "speaking of"

### What Textbooks Get Wrong

However, textbooks fail to explain:

1. **The implications of the topic/subject distinction:**
   - They don't explain that wa NEVER marks the grammatical subject
   - They don't explain that a zero pronoun carries the ga when wa appears to mark the subject

2. **The "unagi" misconception:**
   > "I have even seen teachers write that [watashi wa unagi desu] does in fact mean 'I am an eel' but by some kind of colloquial contraction it is understood in the restaurant to mean 'I will have eel'. This is simply not true."

The instructor explicitly rejects the "colloquial contraction" explanation as incorrect.

## Course Structure & Sequencing

### This Lesson's Place in the Curriculum

The lesson is part of a structured sequence:

1. **Previous Lesson:** Zero Pronoun
   - Explicitly recommended as prerequisite viewing
   - "You can't understand what the wa-particle really does until you understand the zero particle"

2. **Current Lesson:** Wa-Particle (this lesson)

3. **Next Lesson:** Ga and Its Associates
   - Preview: "That is the job of ga and its associates. This is something else that the textbooks do not explain properly, and it will be the subject of our next lesson."
   - Will explain how particles determine "who is doing what to whom"

### The First Lesson Reference

The instructor references an earlier foundational lesson:

> "...the ga that, as I explained in the first lesson, every single Japanese sentence has to have because every Japanese sentence must have a ga-marked subject"

This suggests a course structure where:
- Lesson 1: Basic sentence structure (every sentence needs a ga-marked subject)
- Subsequent lessons: Zero pronoun, then wa-particle, then ga and associates

## The Instructor's Teaching Philosophy

### Making Japanese "Make Sense"

The instructor's approach focuses on revealing the logical structure of Japanese that textbooks obscure:

- Japanese is not illogical or "obscure"
- Patterns in Japanese often parallel patterns in English
- When explanations resort to "colloquial contractions" or unexplained exceptions, there's usually a deeper structural explanation

### Use of English Parallels

The instructor consistently draws parallels with English to make concepts accessible:

1. **"As for me, I am Japanese"** → Shows that "me" ≠ subject in English either
2. **The pronoun "it"** → Shows that context-dependent pronouns exist in English too
3. **"You can pretend you don't know"** → Playful acknowledgment that language relies on context

## The "Pretty Peoples" Opening

The lesson opens with an informal greeting:

> "Hello, pretty peoples."

This suggests a personable, approachable teaching style despite the technical grammatical content. The instructor uses a mix of:
- Casual, friendly tone ("pretty peoples")
- Formal Japanese expressions (これからよろしくお願いします)
- Technical grammatical terminology (grammatical subject, zero pronoun, copula)
- Classroom language ("Class dismissed")

## Observations About the Video Format

### Teaching Style

- Lecture-based rather than interactive
- Heavy use of example sentences analyzed in detail
- Explicit acknowledgment of prerequisites and upcoming content
- Emphasis on understanding structure over memorization

### Visual Elements (Implied)

The instructor refers to "the words on the board," suggesting visual aids were used during the lesson to display example sentences and their structural breakdowns.

## The "KawaJapa" Brand

The instructor identifies as "Cure Dolly from KawaJapa":
- KawaJapa appears to be the brand/channel name
- "Cure Dolly" is the instructor's persona name (likely a reference to Precure/Pretty Cure anime series)
- The teaching approach emphasizes making Japanese "cute" and accessible while maintaining grammatical rigor
