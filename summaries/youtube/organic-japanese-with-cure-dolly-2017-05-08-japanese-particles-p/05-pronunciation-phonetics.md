# 5. Pronunciation & Phonetics

## Overview

This lesson focuses primarily on grammatical concepts rather than pronunciation. However, several Japanese words and phrases are used throughout the video that provide implicit pronunciation models. Below is a compilation of pronunciation-relevant information that can be inferred from the content.

## 5.1. Sound Explanations

### Particles Pronunciation

| Particle | Written | Pronounced | Notes |
|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| は (topic marker) | ha | **wa** | When used as a particle, pronounced "wa" not "ha" |
| を (object marker) | wo | **o** | Often pronounced simply as "o" in modern Japanese |
| が (subject marker) | ga | **ga** | Pronounced as written |
| に (indirect object) | ni | **ni** | Pronounced as written |
| か (question) | ka | **ka** | Pronounced as written |
| の (possessive) | no | **no** | Pronounced as written |

### Words from the Lesson

| Word | Romanization | IPA (Approximate) | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| ミルク | miruku | /miɾɯkɯ/ | Loan word from "milk"; final u is often devoiced |
| ケーキ | keeki | /keːki/ | Long "e" sound (ee); loan word from "cake" |
| 私 | watashi | /wataɕi/ | Standard first-person pronoun |
| あなた | anata | /anata/ | Second-person pronoun |
| 誰 | dare | /daɾe/ | Interrogative "who" |
| 食べた | tabeta | /tabeta/ | Past tense of "to eat" |
| 持っています | motte imasu | /motteimas/ | The "u" in "imasu" is often devoiced |

## 5.2. Intonation & Rhythm

### Question Intonation

Japanese questions marked with か (ka) typically have:
- **Rising intonation** on the final か
- Less dramatic rise than English questions
- Example: 持っていますか↗ (motte imasu ka?)

### Statement Intonation

Declarative sentences typically have:
- **Falling intonation** at the end
- Example: 私が食べた↘ (watashi ga tabeta)

### Phrase from Introduction

**KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu** (かわジャパのキュアドリーです)

Rhythm pattern (mora-based):
```
Ka-wa-Ja-pa no Kyu-a Do-ri-i de-su
(4 mora) (1) (4 mora) (4 mora)
```

Japanese rhythm is **mora-timed** rather than stress-timed like English. Each mora receives roughly equal time.

## 5.3. Common Pronunciation Pitfalls

### For English Speakers Learning Japanese

Based on the vocabulary in this lesson, common challenges include:

| Challenge | Example | Issue | Tip |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----|
| Long vowels | ケーキ (keeki) | Must hold the "e" sound twice as long | Count: ke-e-ki (3 mora) |
| は vs. wa | は particle | Written は but pronounced わ | Memorize particle exceptions |
| を vs. o | を particle | Written を but pronounced お | Modern pronunciation is simply "o" |
| Devoiced vowels | です (desu) | Final "u" is often whispered/silent | Listen to native speakers |
| R sound | ドリー (Dorii) | Japanese "r" is a tap/flap, not English "r" | Tongue taps roof of mouth once |

### Specific to This Lesson

The instructor uses the name **Kyua Dorii** (Cure Dolly):
- The "r" in "Dorii" is a Japanese flap [ɾ], softer than English "r"
- Long "ii" at the end must be held

## 5.4. Pitch Accent (Not Explicitly Covered)

While not discussed in this lesson, Japanese has a **pitch accent** system. For reference:

| Word | Pitch Pattern | Type |
|------|---------------|------|
| 私 (watashi) | wa**TA**shi | Heiban (flat after initial rise) |
| ケーキ (keeki) | **KEE**ki | Atamadaka (high-low) |
| 食べる (taberu) | ta**BE**ru | Nakadaka (middle high) |

Note: Pitch accent patterns vary by dialect and are not addressed in this lesson.

## 5.5. Minimal Pairs / Sound Distinctions

Not explicitly covered in this lesson, but implied through particle usage:

| Sound 1 | Sound 2 | Distinction |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| が (ga) | か (ka) | Voiced vs. voiceless velar |
| は (ha/wa) | わ (wa) | Same sound when は is a particle |
| を (wo/o) | お (o) | Historically distinct, now merged in most dialects |

## 5.6. Notes on Loan Word Pronunciation

Both main vocabulary items (ミルク, ケーキ) are loan words adapted to Japanese phonology:

### English → Japanese Adaptation Rules (Examples)

| English | Japanese | Adaptation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| milk | ミルク (miruku) | Added vowels (i, u) to fit Japanese syllable structure |
| cake | ケーキ (keeki) | "a" becomes long "ee"; added final vowel |

Japanese syllables are typically (C)V – consonant + vowel. Consonant clusters and final consonants from English are broken up with vowels (usually "u" or "o").
