# Argument: Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion and Fiscal Dominance

## Main Point

The Federal Reserve is approaching the end of quantitative tightening (QT) and will likely resume balance sheet expansion in early 2026, not as traditional quantitative easing, but as "technical" accommodation to maintain adequate bank reserves. However, this distinction is somewhat artificial—the reality is that structural fiscal deficits effectively force Fed accommodation through a recursive loop where government spending drives nominal GDP, which determines required reserve levels. This represents a form of "fiscal dominance" where monetary policy becomes constrained by fiscal policy, creating a "nothing stops this train" dynamic of perpetual accommodation.

## The Current State: Liquidity Pressures Emerging

### Jack's Opening Question

> "What's your current view of the Fed's balance sheet and its role in managing liquidity? In late October, we saw some pretty significant spreads of 10 20 basis points secured overnight financing rate above where it should be, indicating that the Federal Reserve was beginning to lose control of of interest rates. What's your view there and its consequences?"

### Alden's Assessment: Roughly On Schedule

> "So far, this is going roughly what even the Fed themselves thought it was going to do. So, they they the New York Fed released reports over the past couple years like annually where they kind of predicted what their balance sheet's going to do and they kind of saw it gradually slow like the the decrease in the balance sheet slowing down by late 2025, maybe early 2026 and then from there growing in line with nominal GDP."

Key point: This isn't a surprise—it's anticipated.

> "That that's kind of how they've roughly seen it going. And we are running into liquidity frictions roughly where they already anticipated that their their pivot is likely to be."

### The Ample vs. Scarce Reserves Framework

Alden notes a subtle but important deviation:

> "They had kind of loose estimates for where it might happen. They have that framework of scarce reserves, ample reserves, and abundant reserves. Overall, this this hit a little bit, I think, earlier than expected in the sense that we're kind of comfortably in ample reserves. the way that they estimated and yet some of this activity points more towards scarce reserves. So perhaps a little bit sooner than they expected, but nothing particularly shocking."

**What This Means:**
The Fed has three categories for reserve levels:
- **Abundant reserves**: Excess liquidity, no stress
- **Ample reserves**: Sufficient but not excess
- **Scarce reserves**: Beginning to show stress

The Fed thought they were comfortably in "ample" but markets showing stress symptoms of "scarce" suggests less cushion than expected.

## The TGA (Treasury General Account) Factor

### Why Liquidity Tightened Faster Than Expected

> "I think part of the reason why this happened a little earlier than expected is because of the TGA. And I'm not the first person to say that, which is that partially because of the government shutdown, they overfilled the Treasury General account. So, they were targeting 850 billion. They temporarily overfilled it to over 950 billion."

### How the TGA Acts as a Liquidity Black Hole

> "And when when they do that, that basically sucks capital out of the financial system and into a void. And so the more capital they have in that void, the less capital there is elsewhere, more less liquidity, I should say, that there is elsewhere."

**The Mechanism:**
When Treasury accumulates cash in TGA → that cash sits at the Fed, not in the banking system → reduces reserves available to banks → creates liquidity pressure → Fed must accommodate to prevent dysfunction

Alden expects this to reverse: "I think over time they're going to push some of that back in."

## Standing Facilities: The Post-2019 Infrastructure

### Learning from the September 2019 Repo Crisis

> "That's also why they have these standing facilities in place, the standing repo facility and reverse repo because they've learned from the September 2019 repo spike. They've already got these facilities in place. They basically structurally permanently increase the fungibility between cash, treasuries, agencies. These things are all pretty swappable without kind of major crises happening."

**What This Means:**
The Fed implemented permanent infrastructure to prevent repo market blow-ups like 2019. Banks can automatically swap treasuries for cash (and vice versa) at the Fed's standing facilities, preventing liquidity crises from cascading.

## The Return to Balance Sheet Growth: Q1-Q2 2026

### Alden's Timeline

> "We are we are roughly running into not only stopping the the QT, they've obviously reported that, but that I do think in the first half of next year, we're going to go back to structurally increasing the balance sheet."

### Two Notable Aspects

**1. Expansion While Inflation Above Target:**

> "One, they're going to be likely increasing the balance sheet when we still have officially above target inflation, which which complicates certain types of discussions around it."

This is unprecedented—previous QE only occurred in crisis/deflation environments.

**2. Higher Base Relative to Broad Money:**

> "Two, we're going to be going back likely to period of balance sheet increases from a higher base in the sense that prior to the global financial crisis, the the monetary base would gradually grow, but it was pretty small relative to broad money because you had a higher kind of fractional ratio."

The new regime:

> "And now you're going to kind of probably go back to that environment of a gradually increasing monetary base rather than kind of the boom and bust you saw in the QE and QT era. But that that whole thing is a much higher percentage of nominal GDP or of broad money supply."

**What This Reveals:**
- Pre-2008: Small monetary base, gradual growth
- 2008-2021: Boom-bust QE/QT cycles
- 2026+: Gradual growth BUT from much higher permanent base

This creates a larger, more permanent Fed presence in the money system.

### Political Complications

> "And of course it's interest bearing in many cases because that that's part of their monetary policy toolkit to to maintain interests where they want. So that brings kind of political ramifications basically paying out money to to banks. And so it's kind of a more politically fraught environment."

**The Issue:**
Fed pays interest on reserves to banks. When the balance sheet is large and interest rates are positive, this becomes a significant transfer to banks, creating political optics problems.

## The Fiscal Dominance Argument

### Nominal GDP Linkage

Jack questions the Fed's framing:

> "And the way that the Fed would explain that is it's not quantitative easing of large-scale expansion in order to ease financial conditions. It's just increasing the amount of reserves so that the banks can function in the regulatory regime that the Congress and the Fed has created for them. So that's I think how the Fed would explain it."

Alden's critical response:

> "I would take some issue with it because to the extent that they're growing their balance sheet or going to grow their balance sheet forecast to grow their balance sheet with nominal GDP, a problem of course is that if the government is running structurally large fiscal deficits that directly affects nominal GDP."

### The Recursive Loop

> "And so you kind of have that recursive function where the Fed's balance sheet, the speed with which they eventually start going back to growing it, will partially be dependent on what Congress and the president are doing with spending. It's just a structural thing—it's kind of an aspect of fiscal dominance."

**What This Means:**
1. Fed says balance sheet will grow with nominal GDP
2. Fiscal deficits boost nominal GDP
3. Higher nominal GDP "requires" faster balance sheet growth
4. This gives Fed cover to accommodate fiscal deficits
5. Creates perpetual accommodation loop

### The "Nothing Stops This Train" View

> "Is kind of part of the nothing stops his train view that whenever the Fed runs into some sort of liquidity issue with these core systems. So in inter interbank interfinancial institutional lending or the treasury market they're going to step in and like the same day either with a standing facility or some sort of decision based on running into these liquidity kind of guard rails and they're going to accommodate and even if they it's the case that part of the reason they need to accommodate is because we're running pretty big structural fiscal deficits."

**The Complete Logic:**
- Fiscal deficits create liquidity demands
- When liquidity gets tight, Fed accommodates immediately
- Fed frames this as "technical" not "monetary policy"
- But the ultimate driver is fiscal deficits
- Therefore fiscal policy effectively dominates monetary policy

### Current Evidence

> "So, we're still in a case where bank lending is not particularly aggressive right now. It's not like a rapid period of loan creation. And instead, it's still the case that that fiscal deficits are fueling a lot. And the only pace we really do see lending and and kind of stuff is is that AI area. So, it's really only the only two games in town, fiscal deficits and AI capex."

## Liquidity Outlook: 2026 Expansion

### The Three-Year Flat Period Ending

> "When they were decreasing their balance sheet they were doing it in a period where there there still was abundant reserves and abundant liquidity because you had a $2 trillion reverse repo facility. So the overall kind of net liquidity has basically been flat for 3 years like the base the base liquidity was flat for like three years."

The turning points:

> "And whenever it kind of got to the lower end of its range. So, one one of those periods was kind of March 2023, kind of going into the regional bank crisis, that was kind of a low point in its range. This recent period, this kind of TGA refill was another low point on its range. When they get to the low point of that range, that's when when they tend to run into these frictions and have to then kind of overshoot in the other direction a little bit, but that when you kind of zoom out, it's roughly been flat for three years."

### Why 2026 Is Different

> "And so, I think that that what's noteworthy is I think we're going to get out of that flat absolute range. we're going to go to a period of kind of structurally increasing again. On average, generally speaking, that that's better liquidity, good for asset prices."

Caveat:

> "Now, that's complicated by the fact that obviously AI and other things have already run in asset prices. So, it's not necessary expensive, crowded, unprofitable or even profitable like in the Mag7's case in in their view."

What benefits:

> "It's more of like the things that have been stagnating for a while, I think, can start catching a bid once we once we enter that period of balance sheet increases, which we're not there yet."

### Current Weakness Explained

> "So, I think kind of the the strains and liquidity we've seen lately. It's not shocking that some of these like unprofitable kind of hyperrowth stocks have been off pretty substantially off their highs in many cases. It's not too shocking that that Bitcoin has had a little bit of a correction here. And I I think that that kind of turmoil probably continues for a period of time."

### 2026 Outlook

> "But when we get to 2026 and specifically whenever we get to the phase where we're actually going back to kind of a structural increasing balance sheet, I think it's on average supportive of those types of assets. But with a caveat, of course, it's it's one variable among many. There's also what's happening with the economy, what what's the Fed doing with interest rates."

## Balance Sheet Growth Without Zero Rates

### Breaking the Old Paradigm

> "But that's another thing is that people often thought that they couldn't go back to balance sheet increases till they get rates to zero. But that's not the case. the the balance sheet was increasing before the global financial crisis even when they had positive interest rates."

The new regime:

> "It's a different environment now. Like I said, it's a much bigger share of the economy and and a bigger share of kind of the money system than it was before. But that basically the balance sheet and interest rates are two very different kind of levers going forward rather than balance sheet expansion just being something you do after you've already kind of exhausted the interest rate channel."

### The Fed's Framing vs. Reality

Jack articulates how the Fed will explain it:

> "And the way that the Fed would explain that is it's not quantitative easing of large-scale expansion in order to ease financial conditions. It's just increasing the amount of reserves so that the banks can function in the regulatory regime that the Congress and the Fed has has created for them. So, that's I think how the Fed would explain it."

Alden's response:

> "Yeah, they would describe it as a technical issue less rather than a monetary issue. I would take and it's it's partially right. I would take some issue with it..."

[Continues with the recursive function / fiscal dominance argument above]

## The Complete Argument Structure

**Layer 1 - Timeline:**
QT ending late 2025 / early 2026 as Fed anticipated
TGA overfill accelerated timeline slightly
Structural balance sheet growth resumes Q1-Q2 2026

**Layer 2 - Standing Facilities Infrastructure:**
Post-2019 reforms created permanent swap facilities
Cash/treasuries/agencies now highly fungible
Prevents acute crises but doesn't prevent liquidity constraints

**Layer 3 - The "Technical" Framing:**
Fed will call it reserve management, not QE
Will cite regulatory requirements and nominal GDP growth
Will maintain that it's different from 2008-2020 QE programs

**Layer 4 - Fiscal Dominance Reality:**
Balance sheet growth tied to nominal GDP
Fiscal deficits drive nominal GDP
Creates recursive loop forcing Fed accommodation
"Nothing stops this train" dynamic

**Layer 5 - New Normal:**
Balance sheet grows from much higher base than pre-2008
Gradual growth rather than boom-bust
But represents larger permanent Fed footprint in money system
Interest-bearing reserves create political complications

**Layer 6 - Decoupling From Interest Rates:**
Balance sheet expansion occurs at positive rates
Not waiting for zero bound
Two separate policy levers now
Breaks the post-2008 paradigm

**Layer 7 - Asset Price Implications:**
2026 liquidity expansion supports risk assets
Benefits stagnating sectors more than already-hot AI
Bitcoin and other "risk-on" assets likely benefit
But one variable among many (economy, rates, valuations matter)

## What This Means

Alden's argument reveals a fundamental shift in monetary policy:

**The Old Regime (Pre-2008):**
- Small balance sheet
- Gradual growth with economy
- Interest rates as primary tool

**The QE Era (2008-2021):**
- Boom-bust balance sheet cycles
- Emergency QE to zero rates
- QT when recovering

**The New Regime (2026+):**
- Large permanent balance sheet
- Gradual ongoing growth
- Decoupled from interest rate policy
- Driven by fiscal dominance
- Framed as "technical" not "monetary"

**Practical Implications:**

1. **For Asset Prices:** 2026 likely brings liquidity tailwinds benefiting risk assets that have stagnated (Bitcoin, value stocks, etc.) more than already-hot sectors (AI).

2. **For Fixed Income:** Fed accommodation while inflation above target creates challenging environment for bonds. Real rates may stay lower than fundamentals suggest due to Fed's structural need to accommodate.

3. **For Fiscal Policy:** The recursive loop creates moral hazard—larger deficits require more Fed accommodation, reducing political pressure for fiscal discipline.

4. **For Inflation:** Ongoing balance sheet growth from higher base with positive interest rates in above-target inflation environment is untested territory. Unclear whether this is inflationary or if reserve management really is "technical."

5. **For Policy Independence:** Fiscal dominance means Fed's operational independence narrows even if legal independence remains. Must accommodate to prevent financial dysfunction regardless of fiscal drivers.

**Bottom Line:**

The Federal Reserve will resume balance sheet expansion in early 2026, framing it as technical reserve management rather than quantitative easing. While partially accurate (standing facilities and regulatory requirements do create technical needs), the deeper reality is fiscal dominance—structural deficits drive nominal GDP, which determines required reserve levels, creating a recursive loop forcing perpetual accommodation. 

**The Core Mechanism:** Without Fed balance sheet expansion (i.e., "not-QE QE"), there would be a liquidity crunch because no one else can absorb the massive ongoing debt issuance from structural fiscal deficits. In such a scenario, institutions would be forced to sell bonds and stocks to obtain liquidity, creating downward pressure on asset prices and potential market dysfunction. The Fed must accommodate to prevent this—not as a policy choice, but as a structural necessity to maintain financial system stability given the scale of government borrowing.

This represents a new monetary regime where the balance sheet grows gradually from a much higher permanent base, decoupled from interest rate policy, and ultimately constrained by fiscal policy. The "nothing stops this train" view holds: whenever core financial markets show liquidity stress, the Fed accommodates immediately regardless of whether fiscal deficits are the underlying cause. For asset prices, this suggests 2026 brings liquidity tailwinds particularly for sectors that have stagnated while AI boomed, though this is complicated by already-elevated valuations and uncertain economic conditions. The key insight is that monetary policy has structurally changed—what looks like technical operations is actually accommodation driven by fiscal dominance, creating conditions likely to persist for 5-15+ years as developed market sovereign debt dynamics play out.
