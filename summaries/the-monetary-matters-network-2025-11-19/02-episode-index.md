### People

**Lyn Alden:** Investment strategist, engineer, and general partner at Ego Death Capital. The primary guest providing technical and economic analysis throughout the episode. Known for research service at lynalden.com and long-term bullish positions on Bitcoin and gold.

**Jason Furman:** Economist mentioned as the source for GDP growth calculations excluding AI capital expenditure (0.1% real GDP growth vs. 4.1% headline).

**Ray Kurzweil:** Futurist and author referenced regarding "the singularity" and his methodology for mapping neuron activity in the brain against computer processing power over time.

**Jameson Lopp:** Bitcoin developer and security expert who presented evidence at a conference (approximately two years before this recording) that Hal Finney was running (jogging) while Satoshi was posting on forums, challenging theories that Finney was Satoshi.

**Hal Finney:** Early Bitcoin developer, cryptographer, and recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi. Discussed as a top candidate for Satoshi's identity before recent evidence cast doubt. Finney passed away, and his widow has faced harassment from people believing she has access to Satoshi's coins.

**Satoshi Nakamoto:** Pseudonymous creator(s) of Bitcoin. The episode discusses evidence about identity, including programming language familiarity, time zone analysis, and the estimated ~1 million unmoved Bitcoin attributed to early mining during Bitcoin's launch phase.

**Martin Shkreli (Martin Skreli):** Mentioned as a noted short-seller of quantum computing stocks, arguing that commercial quantum applications are 20-30+ years away, with Bitcoin cracking being one of the few financially attractive problems quantum could solve.

**Michael Saylor:** CEO of MicroStrategy, referenced as an example of ideological commitment to Bitcoin accumulation, continuously raising capital to purchase more Bitcoin "hell or high water."

**Jim Chanos:** Short-seller mentioned regarding arguments about AI chip depreciation schedules, suggesting that actual useful life of GPUs may be much shorter (2 years) than accounting assumptions (5-7 years), artificially inflating earnings.

### Organizations & Companies

**VanEck:** Sponsor of the episode through their Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF (ticker: REMX). Provides exposure to rare earth minerals used in technology and defense applications.

**Ego Death Capital:** Venture capital firm where Lyn Alden serves as general partner, focusing on Series A and seed investments in Bitcoin-related startups and stablecoins, emphasizing "high utility, low speculation."

**MIT:** Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referenced regarding a study showing that corporate AI trials have a low success rate in demonstrably saving money or improving quality, though AI shows promise for backend operational improvements.

**Federal Reserve / New York Fed:** Central bank discussed extensively regarding balance sheet management, quantitative tightening, Treasury General Account dynamics, and standing repo facilities.

**Nvidia:** GPU manufacturer experiencing cycles of boom and consolidation related to technology adoption (cryptocurrency mining in 2017, current AI boom). Core example throughout discussion of AI infrastructure investment.

**OpenAI:** Leading AI company mentioned as unprofitable with no clear path to profitability, exemplifying the speculative nature of many AI investments.

**Alphabet (Google/YouTube):** Discussed as Alden's preferred AI-adjacent investment due to: (1) profitable core ad business not heavily disrupted by AI, (2) leading AI research position, (3) ownership of YouTube benefiting from AI-driven content creation.

**Meta (Facebook):** Referenced regarding metaverse capital expenditure that was poorly received by markets (stock declined significantly), forcing a pivot. Also mentioned as one of the hyperscalers making massive AI investments and recently securing $2 billion in bond financing.

**Microsoft, Amazon, Google:** The "hyperscalers" or major cloud providers making profitable AI infrastructure investments with locked-in customer demand.

**MicroStrategy:** Bitcoin treasury company using leverage to accumulate Bitcoin, discussed as a primary demand source for Bitcoin in 2024-2025. Trading at premium to net asset value (NAV), which Alden views as unsustainable.

**Oracle:** Technology company whose credit default swaps have widened, cited as an early warning signal of market skepticism about AI-related debt.

**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices):** Semiconductor company mentioned as an investment Alden entered during a significant pullback and exited after "roughly a double" (likely too early as stock made new highs).

**Core Weave, Nebius:** "Neoclouds" that buy compute from data centers and rent it out, distinguished from companies with actual structural resources like property or low-cost energy rights.

**Tesla:** Implicitly referenced in discussion of autonomous vehicles and edge cases requiring human intervention.

**iRobot (robot vacuum cleaners):** Used as example of how even relatively simple robotics problems (cleaning flat surfaces) have struggled to become economically dominant despite decades of development, illustrating hardware challenges.

**Pimco, Blue Owl:** Financial institutions mentioned as participating in a Meta bond deal earning $2 billion, illustrating that fixed-income market appetite for AI-related debt remains strong despite credit concerns.

**Alibaba:** Chinese tech company mentioned as a leader in AI development in China, achieving impressive results with cheaper chips and lower investment than U.S. counterparts.

### Concepts, Places & Miscellaneous

**Fedwire:** The Federal Reserve's wire transfer system, processing approximately 200 million transactions annually—roughly equal to Bitcoin's current theoretical transaction capacity with existing block sizes.

**Lightning Network, Chaumian eCash, Layer 2s:** Bitcoin scaling technologies mentioned as necessary for handling transaction volume beyond base layer capacity, allowing financial or software layers to lock into the main Bitcoin network.

**PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index):** Economic indicator measuring manufacturing and services activity, discussed as showing persistent stagnation (flat for years) despite political rhetoric about manufacturing revival.

**Four-Year Halving Cycle:** Bitcoin's programmed reduction in mining rewards every four years, with historical pattern of bull market peaks in Q4 of halving years (2013, 2017, 2021), creating self-fulfilling selling pressure in 2025.

**Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and Reverse Repo Facility:** Federal Reserve tools established after September 2019 repo market spike, permanently increasing fungibility between cash, treasuries, and agency securities to prevent liquidity crises.

**SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate):** Overnight interest rate that showed spreads of 10-20 basis points above expected levels in late October 2025, indicating Fed was beginning to lose control of interest rates due to liquidity constraints.

**TGA (Treasury General Account):** U.S. Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve, which became overfilled to $950+ billion (vs. $850 billion target) due to government shutdown dynamics, "sucking capital out of the financial system."

**Moore's Law:** The observation that computing power doubles approximately every two years, referenced in discussion of when supercomputers might achieve processing comparable to human brains.

Alden notes more energy is flared annually worldwide than the entire Bitcoin network consumes.

**Quantum Computing:** Emerging technology discussed as potential long-term threat to Bitcoin's cryptographic security. Could potentially compromise certain Bitcoin address types, particularly early Satoshi coins. Alden notes Bitcoin is upgradable to become "quantum hard" but with trade-offs in transaction size and potential need for hard fork.

**Scarce Reserves, Ample Reserves, Abundant Reserves:** Federal Reserve framework for classifying banking system reserve levels, determining when balance sheet growth should resume.

**Fiscal Dominance:** Economic condition where government fiscal policy (deficits/spending) effectively constrains or determines monetary policy, with central bank forced to accommodate to prevent financial instability.

**Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** Financial instruments providing insurance against bond defaults, discussed as showing early warning signs for Oracle and other AI-related debt.

**Bubble, Consolidation, Rollover:** Market cycle terminology used throughout to describe Alden's expectations for AI investments—believing current environment represents speculative excess within a genuinely transformative trend.
