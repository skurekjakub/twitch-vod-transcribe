# Argument: Is AI Investment in a Bubble?

## Main Point

AI represents genuine long-term economic transformation comparable to the internet, but current investment levels show bubble characteristics similar to the dot-com era and fiber optic cable overinvestment. The critical issue isn't whether AI is real (it is), but whether current capital deployment ($400 billion in 2025, potentially $1 trillion by 2028) is happening faster than profitable use cases can emerge. The distinction between profitable infrastructure (Nvidia, hyperscalers) and unprofitable application layer creates severe valuation risk.

## The Central Question

Jack frames the stakes:

> "Is the US economy and the S&P 500 just a bet on on AI now? And if so how do you feel about this bet? Lynn, as a someone who's trained as an engineer, what do you think about AI? And do you think that the massive sums being poured into this space, $400 billion this year, maybe a trillion dollars in 2028, something like that, I don't know, is going to be is going to be worth it from from a societal sense, from an investment sense as well?"

## Lyn Alden's Framework: Real Trend, Cyclical Bubble

### The Parallel to Internet and Bitcoin

Alden immediately establishes her baseline view:

> "The short answer I I I I think that it's real. Like I think that basically the economic the long-term economic growth in this will be substantial but like many things I think there will be bubbles along the way."

Her two historical analogies:

**The Internet:**
> "That was of course true for the internet where people said it's going to change everything and they did. It just it took took you know more time than some of those initial investments thought. For example, those laying the you know the fiber optics cables."

**Bitcoin:**
> "When we look over say Bitcoin over the past 16 years it's both true that at times it's a bubble but that it's also been structural from bubble to bubble. And so I I kind of view AI similarly that it it can get over its skis for periods of time, but that when we look back five 10 years from now, we will say yes, this was quite transformative and that it it it changed both the economy and kind of the nature of a lot of things."

**What This Means:**
Real transformation doesn't preclude speculative excess. In fact, the most transformative technologies tend to generate the biggest bubbles precisely because the long-term vision is credible even when near-term execution fails.

## The Profitability Problem: Selling $20 Bills for $10

### The Core Financial Concern

> "From a financial perspective. Obviously the issue is that many of the AI companies themselves are not profitable. uh it's very much funded by VC which is normal in an earlier stage of of a technology. But when you're talking about kind of some of the biggest private companies in the world still running unprofitably and importantly not really even having a forecast to get the profitability anytime soon that's obviously a concern because you can always have very good growth numbers when you're selling $20 bills for $10."

### Why This Creates Reversal Risk

> "But if your growth just comes to a halt when you when you aim toward being profitable and stop being kind of that externally funded system, it can it can reverse quicker than people think."

**The Logic:**
- Growth funded by venture capital burning cash looks impressive
- Growth funded by genuine profitable demand is sustainable
- The transition from VC-subsidized to profitable operations often reveals how much "growth" was actually just subsidized customer acquisition
- Companies like OpenAI showing no path to profitability despite massive scale raises existential questions

## The Profitable vs. Unprofitable Divide

Alden makes a critical distinction:

> "Obviously Nvidia is making money and the uh you know the the big kind of hyperscalers are making money and it's really kind of the other areas that are unprofitable and therefore funded more by speculation about what they will do in in say over five years let alone not even really have tracking toward profitable in the next five years."

**Who's Making Money:**
- Nvidia (selling chips)
- Hyperscalers: Microsoft, Google, Amazon (selling cloud services)
- These have **locked-in customer demand** and **proven business models**

**Who's Not:**
- OpenAI and similar foundation model companies
- Many application layer companies
- These rely on **speculative future profitability** with no clear path

## Investment Strategy: Three Approaches

### Approach 1: Profitable Infrastructure Players (When Reasonably Valued)

> "I mean I I've been at times long and bullish on the chipmakers. Other times pull back when when they get I in my view over their skis."

Alden trades these cyclically based on valuation, recognizing they're real businesses but can become overpriced.

### Approach 2: Companies Using AI to Reduce Costs (Protected Front End)

Alden references an MIT study showing corporate AI trials have low success rates except in one area:

> "One thing they did find is that AI was very helpful on the back end. And so one thing I I look at is like kind of regulated or monopoly type of businesses that can use AI to lower their cost on their back end but that are protected on it on their front end."

Examples:

> "For example, banks or insurance companies. These are these are kind of in some sense capital intensive, not in the physical way, but in the in the way that obviously you need big balance sheets to do them. They often are operated sections of the economy. They've got back-end expenses that are some percentage of that is automatable and yet their core service is actually pretty challenging to disrupt."

**The Logic:**
Find companies with:
- Regulatory/capital moats protecting revenue
- Significant back-end operations that AI can optimize
- Ability to capture cost savings without revenue disruption

### Approach 3: Distribution Platforms That Benefit from AI Content Creation

Alden's detailed case for Alphabet:

**Threat Perception:**
> "I've been for example long Alphabet even though there were early concerns that they might actually get disrupted by AI. I've been on the camp that they're that I think they're pretty well positioned there."

**Why AI Disruption Is Overstated:**

> "One is that AI was mostly disrupting like nonprofitable types of searches, right? So if I want to if I want to look up what was Napoleon what was Napoleon's wife name, right? That's something that Google or AI could tell me the answer and Google's not going to make money selling me something based on that me looking that up. It's just a fact I want to know. Whereas if I look up plumbers near me, Google very much wants to have that business. And AI in many cases was disrupting kind of the former."

**Competitive Position:**

> "They've also been one of the leading players in AI kind of they don't get as much obviously focus as as Open AI does, but they've had they've had kind of a leading position there. They've obviously got a lot of profitable firepower to to back it up."

**The YouTube Thesis:**

> "And that also my view is that AI and and basically makes video generation less expensive. I think we're going to continue to see a growth of video content and Alphabet owns the biggest along with Tik Tok. YouTube is like the biggest video platform out there. They've actually been taking pretty decent market share in paid video, but even just like amateur creation, I mean, people use AI to do podcasts, like edit podcasts. They use AI to translate things. They use AI to help with graphics. Those higher bandwidth types of things are historically expensive. AI can compress the cost of doing so, which makes more of them. And if you run the biggest platform that that benefits from them as long as you don't get heavily disrupted elsewhere, it's interesting."

**What This Reveals:**
The best AI investment might be companies that:
1. Own distribution platforms (YouTube)
2. Benefit from increased AI-generated content supply (lower creation costs → more content)
3. Maintain monetization control (ad revenue)
4. Have internal AI capabilities to avoid disruption

## The "Neoclouds" and Energy Resource Distinction

When asked about companies buying compute and renting it out:

> "The short answer is the part that interested me there is the ones that actually have the real resources, the ones that have the basically the property or the rights to to re like lowcost structurally lowcost energy for example that then incorporate that into their data center business because that's where I think the competitive mode is. I think energy is actually one of the the biggest moes here."

Alden favors:
- Former Bitcoin miners with structural access to low-cost energy
- Companies with power purchase agreements
- Those owning "hard to replace" resources

Versus avoiding:
- Companies just renting compute without underlying resource control
- "Using that ability temporarily that can come and go"

## Signs of Bubble Behavior

### Credit Market Warnings

> "I mean, we've already seen credit default swaps of some of these AI related bonds. That's an early signal the market saying, are you are you guys sure about this?"

This is occurring **without even a major stock market drawdown**, suggesting bond markets are more skeptical than equity markets.

### Recursive and "Incestuous" Financing

Later in the conversation:

> "I think that the industry as a whole is is a little bit bubbishious now especially with some of these like recursive deals between each other kind of a little bit incestuous financing going on signs not of a bottom."

**What This Means:**
When AI companies are financing each other's growth (company A buys services from company B, company B invests in company A), it creates circular validation of demand that may not reflect genuine end-user economics.

### The Pimco/Blue Owl/Meta Example

Jack notes:

> "Pimco did a deal with Blue Owl and Facebook Meta and they made $2 billion in a day by by funding this bond."

His interpretation:

> "There's so much money in the fixed income world that is fee based as well as carry, you know, profit, you know, incentive based that even if they are bad deals, I don't know. I don't have the like the it's happening."

Alden agrees: "Yeah, I think for a while. Yeah, I agree."

**The Problem:**
When financial intermediaries are incentivized by fees rather than long-term credit quality, capital continues flowing to questionable projects longer than fundamentals would justify.

## The Rollover Thesis: Price First, Then Capex

### Jack's Direct Challenge on Timing

> "I'm not going to ask you the question and try and corner you and say, 'When is this AI bubble going to pop?' Because that would be about share prices and that's so hard to predict. But maybe something a little bit more tangible. When do you think the turnover in AI capital expenditure is going to be?"

Jack provides the telecom bubble analogy:

> "The capital expenditure on telecom was higher in 98 than it was in 1997. Higher in 1999 than it was in 1998, higher in 2000 than in 1999. But 2000 was the peak and then it from it went down from 2000 to 2001, then from 2001 to 2002."

### Alden's Response: Price Then Capex, 1-2 Year Lag

> "I think that the share price and the capex are are actually somewhat intertwined so that they're not just two different things because and an example of that is when when Facebook kind of went quote unquote all in on the metaverse even changed their name to Meta was doing a lot of capex on VR. I mean their share price took a really big hit and and they kind of had to to pivot. Basically the market saying we don't love this."

Her base case:

> "I think that as long as the market loves it, these really big AI companies will most likely keep pretty aggressively pushing it. But I do think that the the price probably rolls over first and then capex. It's it's quite pro it's quite possible that we're in the rolled over phase for price now."

Timeline estimate:

> "I do think that in the next 12 months or so we we could see the rollover in kind of the for the price and then capex maybe follows by a year or two that's if if I had to give a base case it might be something like that."

**Qualification:**

> "But that wouldn't necessarily be like quote unquote the forever like rollover that could be kind of like how back when Ethereum was using GPUs used to mine. So in in say let's say 2017, Nvidia had this really big boom and then it cooled off, but that's now like a micro blip on the Nvidia chart."

## Jack's Follow-Up: Is This Already the Top?

Jack pushes on the implications:

> "That's really interesting, Lin that you think that your base case could be that like this is the top and that the share prices are decline. Obviously, not the perma top, but like the the top for this cycle. That's really interesting to me. I feel like if you have that view, isn't it almost a necessary view, a following view that you are bearish on the S&P over the next year?"

### Alden's Nuanced Response: Consolidation vs. Crash

> "The way I would phrase it is I it's not that I expected a giant rollover, but I think we could see a consolidation. So I I think it could have a a flat year. I think it could be up down 10%. That's that's still pretty weak for the kind of the recent trend in the S&P."

Why consolidation is enough to change behavior:

> "And even when you enter a kind of a gradual rollover or a consolidation, that can lead investors and companies to scrutinize their spending more. So it doesn't take necessary a crash like in Meta's case or kind of a partial crash. Just a period of kind of more weakness."

She points to already-occurring signals:

> "I mean, we've already seen credit default swaps of some of these AI related bonds. That's the that's an early signal of the market saying, are you are you guys sure about this? And there's and that's even without a a major draw down in in in kind of the broad space."

Recent examples:

> "We already saw like recently if you look at like the AMD chart, the Nvidia chart, they had these really big kind of pullbacks and then new highs."

Her trade: "I was I got into AMD in my research service when it had that really big pullback got out which probably proves to be too early after like roughly a double."

## Counter-Argument: CEO Commitment

Jack challenges the consolidation thesis:

> "It seems to me like that the CEOs of these giant trillion dollar companies, they are so dedicated to this project that they're just going to spend as much money as they can as quickly as possible. And you know, their stock price is going to have to go down a lot more than 20% for them to stop doing that. And you know, no insult to to anyone, but it's kind it's kind of like you know, Michael Sailor is such a believer in in Bitcoin. He is going to be issuing stock and financing stuff, raising money to buy as much Bitcoin as possible. like hell hell or high water. And I think it the same is true of these tech CEOs."

### Alden's Rebuttal: From Growth to Flat Is Significant

> "I I do think it would take quite a bit of pain to slow them down. And I I also think that again going from growing to flat is a big deal or going from growing sharply to then growing mildly and all the analysts kind of reducing their estimates is a big deal."

More realistic scenario than sharp reversal:

> "I think that's a more realistic deal than oh like basically we have a giant capex boom and then it turns out the next year is like nominally lower by a substantial amount. I think that kind of sharp reversal to your point is very unlikely because I think that so many CEOs view this as structural existential."

What would actually happen:

> "They might come out with a statement. We we want to clarify we're pursuing profitable growth. We are being responsible and maybe they say, 'Okay, we'll dial back our expectations to some extent.' That's a more realistic scenario. The rate of change rolling over and and things consolidating more so than just a sharp reversal."

## Alden's Overall Assessment: "Bubblicious" But Based on Reality

When directly asked "do you think AI is in a bubble?":

> "I think it's in part. I think it's in part a bubble but based on a real trend that is that is worth trillions and that will notably impact things over 5 10 plus years but that much like Nvidia was in a kind of a local bubble in 2017 cooled off got into another bubble cooled off got into another bubble I I think that kind of the industry as a whole is is a little bit bubbishious now."

### Why Cycles Are Necessary

> "Any growth industry needs to go through cycles like that. Otherwise, it just goes to the moon. Like it's just basically it needs kind of that speculative froth where someone's willing to finance. anytime someone puts AI into a name if if it gets financed that is not sustainable that needs to get shaken off and then say okay well that wasn't sustainable but this pocket is and so kind of capital gets a moment to recalibrate and go toward what's actually working."

## The Complete Argument Structure

**Layer 1 - Real Transformation:**
AI is genuinely transformative like the internet, not vaporware

**Layer 2 - Profitability Divide:**
Infrastructure (Nvidia, hyperscalers) profitable
Applications (OpenAI, etc.) unprofitable with no clear path
This creates severe asymmetric risk

**Layer 3 - Historical Pattern:**
Real technologies (internet, fiber optics, Bitcoin) all experienced bubbles
Transformation and speculation coexist

**Layer 4 - Current Bubble Signals:**
- Credit default swaps widening
- Unprofitable companies at massive scale
- "Incestuous financing" between AI companies
- Fee-driven capital deployment regardless of credit quality

**Layer 5 - Timeline Expectation:**
Stock prices: possibly rolling over now or within 6-12 months
Capex: follows by 1-2 years
Not a crash but a transition from explosive growth to consolidation

**Layer 6 - CEO Commitment vs. Market Reality:**
CEOs are ideologically committed
But transition from explosive growth to flat growth triggers scrutiny
"Pursuing profitable growth" becomes the new messaging

**Layer 7 - Necessary Cycle:**
Growth industries require shakeouts to "trim fat"
Separates genuinely profitable use cases from speculation
Allows capital to recalibrate toward what actually works

## What This Means

Alden's position is sophisticated and non-binary:

**Not Saying:**
- AI is fake or overhyped
- Avoid all AI investment
- Imminent crash coming

**Actually Saying:**
- AI is real but current investment has bubble characteristics
- Focus on profitable infrastructure and distribution platforms
- Expect consolidation (not crash) within 6-12 months for stocks
- Capex growth will slow 1-2 years after stock consolidation
- This is a necessary, healthy cycle for capital reallocation
- Long-term (5-15 years) AI remains highly transformative
- Near-term (1-3 years) expect choppiness as speculation gets wrung out

**Investment Implications:**
- Be selective: profitable infrastructure > unprofitable applications
- Look for companies with moats using AI to reduce costs
- Own distribution platforms benefiting from AI content generation
- Expect volatility but don't abandon the theme entirely
- Think in cycles: current bubble → consolidation → next cycle
- Energy/power infrastructure likely benefits throughout

**Bottom Line:**

AI is both a genuine transformation **and** in a speculative bubble—these are not contradictory positions. Like the internet in 2000, the long-term thesis is correct while near-term valuations and capital deployment have run ahead of profitable use cases. The key insight is the profitability divide: Nvidia and hyperscalers sell to companies with proven demand, while companies like OpenAI burn capital selling subsidized services with no path to profitability. Credit markets are already skeptical (widening CDS spreads), and stock consolidation likely began or will begin within 6-12 months, followed by capex growth deceleration 1-2 years later. This isn't the "forever top" but rather a necessary cycle to separate genuine productivity gains from speculation—exactly what growth industries require. The practical strategy is to own profitable infrastructure and distribution platforms while avoiding unprofitable application layer companies, recognizing that CEO commitment will prevent sharp reversals but won't prevent growth-to-flat transitions that trigger capital reallocation.
