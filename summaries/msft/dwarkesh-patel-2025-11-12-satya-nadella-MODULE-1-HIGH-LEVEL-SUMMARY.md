## Dwarkesh Patel Podcast - Satya Nadella Interview (November 12, 2025)

This episode features Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in conversation with hosts Dwarkesh Patel and Dylan Patel (founder of SemiAnalysis), recorded during a tour of Microsoft's Fairwater 2 data center in Atlanta, Georgia—the world's most powerful data center at the time of recording. The conversation explores Microsoft's strategic positioning in the AI revolution, covering the company's massive infrastructure investments (approaching $100 billion in annual capex), the evolution of the hyperscale computing business, and the competitive dynamics between software-as-a-service models and emerging AI-native business models. 

Nadella articulates his vision of AI as a "cognitive amplifier" and "guardian angel" rather than accepting AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) framing, emphasizing a measured, pragmatic approach to technological diffusion similar to the Industrial Revolution. The discussion delves deeply into technical infrastructure decisions (GPU networking, data center topology, power density challenges), Microsoft's dual strategy of partnering with OpenAI while building independent AI capabilities through Microsoft AI (MAI), competitive dynamics with coding assistants (GitHub Copilot vs. Cursor, Claude Code, etc.), and the geopolitical implications of AI sovereignty across different nations. Throughout the conversation, Nadella defends Microsoft's strategic pause on certain data center builds, explaining the importance of fleet fungibility, workload diversity, and avoiding over-commitment to single hardware generations, while addressing concerns about ceding market share to competitors like Oracle in the bare-metal hosting business for AI labs.
