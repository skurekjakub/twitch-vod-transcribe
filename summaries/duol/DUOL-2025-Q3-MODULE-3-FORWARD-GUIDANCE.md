3. Product improvements (Energy mechanic, retention features)
4. Comping strong Q4 2024 growth

---

## Qualitative Guidance & Management Outlook

### Strategic Priorities (2025-2026 Timeframe)

#### 1. **Long-Term Investment in User Growth Over Near-Term Monetization**

**CEO von Ahn (Opening Remarks):**
> "We believe AI will fundamentally transform education, and we have line of sight to building a product that teaches better than ever before. That's what makes this such an exciting moment for Duolingo."

**CEO von Ahn (Q&A):**
> "The goal here is to be **growing DAUs fast for a very long time**. We see a huge opportunity over the next few years. If we're able to do an app that teaches just that well, way much better than we have now, we would be talking about **billions of users** that we have, and that's what we want to shoot for here."

**CFO Skaruppa:**
> "This is just a **balancing act** that we've always done, and we're just slightly focusing a little bit different as we navigate those. So it's not that we haven't been making any of them. And you've seen that in the rest of the year guide and the Q4 guide, there was a **relatively small financial impact** from this kind of reprioritization. And we think that's worth it because as Luis said, it's a huge opportunity. The risk-reward seems right."

**What This Means:**
- Management will deprioritize experiments that boost near-term bookings but hurt DAU growth (e.g., reducing free user energy limits)
- Increased R&D spend on teaching efficacy and course improvements (3-5 year payback period)
- Accepting **slower bookings growth in Q4 2025** and potentially into 2026 to maximize long-term platform LTV

---

#### 2. **AI-Driven Product Roadmap: 2026 Launches**

**Guided Video Calls (Beginner-Friendly)**
- **Current State:** Video calls only available in target language (monolingual), too difficult for beginners
- **New Feature:** Bilingual guided calls (e.g., English + Spanish) to make video calls accessible to beginners
- **Target Audience:** "Most of our users and certainly most of our Max subscribers are beginner users"
- **Monetization:** Not yet advertised to non-subscribers; once live, will use to drive Max conversions
- **Timeline:** "Next few months" (Q1-Q2 2026 launch expected)

**Language Coverage Expansion**
- **Goal:** Top 9 languages (Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) will reach **Duolingo Score 130**
- **Duolingo Score 130:** Equivalent to CEFR level B2 (job-ready proficiency in knowledge work)
- **Timeline:** "Over the next few months" (Q1-Q2 2026)
- **Current Gap:** Most languages don't yet reach B2 level; expansion will add significant content

**Chess Course Expansion**
- **Current Performance:** "Fastest-growing course," already surpassed math and music by DAUs
- **Retention:** "Slightly higher than language learning" (over 3-4 month measurement period)
- **New Feature:** PVP (player-vs-player) mode
  - Currently: 50% rollout on iOS
  - Timeline: Android rollout "within the next few weeks" → full rollout to all users in Q4 2025/Q1 2026
- **Management:** CEO expressed strong confidence: "Very excited about chess... expect quite a bit of growth from chess"

**Math Course Expansion**
- **Current State:** Limited content coverage
- **Goal:** Full K-12 Common Core curriculum coverage
- **Timeline:** "In the next few months" (Q1-Q2 2026)
- **Strategic Importance:** Math is adjacent to language learning TAM, addresses education market broadly

**Music Course Revamp**
- **Status:** "Full revamp of our music course" planned
- **Timeline:** 2026 (no specific quarter mentioned)
- **Context:** Music has lagged chess in adoption; revamp intended to boost engagement

---

#### 3. **Social Features Rollout**

**CEO von Ahn:**
> "The app is gonna be **a lot more social**. We're gonna have all the, you know, right now, the math course only has a little bit of content."

**What This Means:**
- Likely leaderboards, multiplayer features, social challenges (similar to chess PVP)
- Intended to boost DAU/MAU ratio and retention
- Timeline: Not specified, but implied for 2026

---

#### 4. **Duolingo Score Standardization Push**

**CEO von Ahn:**
> "The ultimate goal at least the major languages and certainly for English where rather than when people ask you, you know, how much French do you know or how much English do you know, at the moment what people say is like, oh, I'm intermediate. We want people to say, **I am a Duolingo 60 in French. Or I'm a Duolingo 80 in English. That is what we want.**"

**Current Status:**
- **Duolingo English Test:** Accepted by 6,000+ educational institutions
- **99 of top 100 US universities** accept DET (including all Ivy League schools)
- **LinkedIn Integration:** Users can now share Duolingo Score on LinkedIn; "seeing quite a good number of people sharing their score"
- **Asia Focus:** English learners in Asia most likely to use score for job/education purposes

**Strategic Importance:**
- Duolingo Score becoming industry standard would create network effects
- Drives engagement (users work toward score milestones)
- Monetization opportunity (premium tiers unlock unlimited testing)

---

### Geographic Expansion & China Strategy

#### Asia (Especially China) Growth

**CEO von Ahn:**
> "Asia is a really good example that, you know, there's we are certainly still posting or have never stopped posting on Hinge content in Asia know, kind of from the social media side, but also we're just getting a lot more users there. So that's the parts that are growing the fastest."

**China-Specific Guidance:**
- **Current Scale:** "Fastest-growing country" and "second-largest country in terms of DAUs"
- **Revenue Contribution:** **5-6% of total business** (as of Q3 2025)
- **DAU Growth:** "Growing very fast"
- **Engagement:** "Very high" retention per management

**Duolingo Max in China:**
- **Status:** Currently being tested, pending regulatory approvals
- **Timeline:** "Some number of weeks or months" for full launch (Q4 2025 or Q1 2026)
- **Regulatory Context:** As an LLM-based product, Max required pre-approval for testing in China
- **Current Progress:** Testing permissions obtained; moving along "pretty well"

**Risk Management:**
- **Marketing Spend:** "Very modest amount" in China due to geopolitical risk
- **Strategy:** Organic growth focus; if geopolitical issues arise, "we just didn't end up investing all that much there"

---

### Monetization & Pricing Strategy

#### Pricing Experimentation

**CEO von Ahn:**
> "In terms of price increases, you'll see us we'll be testing prices. We'll be testing all kinds of things, and we'll see us launch the things that we think are good for the whole platform. I don't know exactly what's going to win. But you'll see us **test prices. And by that, I mean, up and down.** We'll probably test some prices much lower or a package... We'll probably do a **package that is, like, half price, that is, like, you know, super light.**"

**Potential Pricing Actions:**
1. **"Super Light" Package:** Lower-priced tier (50% of Super price) to capture price-sensitive users
2. **Max Price Increases:** Testing higher prices for premium AI features
3. **Family Plan Promotions:** Enhanced focus during New Year's promotion (family plan is annual-only)

**ARPU Guidance:**
- **Current Trend:** "Mid-single digits percentage" ARPU increase each quarter in 2025
- **Driver:** Primarily Duolingo Max adoption (higher-priced tier), not base price increases
- **Implication:** Expect continued mid-single-digit ARPU growth in 2026

---

#### New Year's Promotion Strategy (Q4 2025)

**CFO Skaruppa:**
> "This year, we did energy, which is a **core pricing mechanic**. And we have **never run a New Year's promo with energy**. So we're gonna be experimenting with all sorts of things as we get towards the end of the year with the promo. On how we run it, how we show it and display it, when we run it, all of these types of things."

**Key Points:**
1. Energy mechanic launched earlier in 2025, now being tested in Q4 New Year's promo for first time
2. High variability/uncertainty in Q4 bookings due to new promo mechanics
3. Family plan expected to perform well (29% of subs in Q3 2025, up from prior quarters)
4. Discount levels may vary based on new pricing architecture (higher base prices enable deeper discounts)

**Risk:** Q4 is Duolingo's "most variable quarter" due to New Year's promotion experimentation.

---

### Competitive Positioning & AI Moats

#### Not Concerned About Generative AI Competition

**CEO von Ahn (ChatGPT/AI Competition):**
> "We're **not particularly worried** about that. You know, the main thing that we do really well not only do we teach well, the main thing that we do really well is **keep people engaged**. And in order to learn a language, you need to be engaged for years, really. It takes years to learn a language coming every day. And we need to keep you engaged actually doing it. And not only that, we also need to have **curriculum for years** for you to do that."

**Moat Elements:**
1. **Engagement:** Duolingo's gamification keeps users returning daily (37.3% DAU/MAU ratio)
2. **Curriculum Depth:** Years of structured content vs. ChatGPT's ad-hoc responses
3. **Habit Formation:** Streaks, leaderboards, and notifications create behavioral lock-in
4. **Learning Science:** Spaced repetition, adaptive difficulty, and pedagogical rigor

**On Real-Time Translation Threat:**
> "Nobody's gonna wanna learn a language because, you know, we're gonna have simultaneous language translation and, okay. Also not worried about that. You know, I believe in 100% of the Google IO conferences over the last ten years, they have showcased simultaneous language translation... we have not seen the desire to learn a language go down at all in fact, it has come up."

**User Cohort Defense:**
1. **Hobby Learners:** Learning for intrinsic motivation (like chess despite computers being better)
2. **English Learners (Job-Seeking):** "People who are learning English and they actually wanna learn English... being able to have, a phone that they have to hold out, it just kinda that's not what they wanna do"

---

### Max (Premium Tier) Performance & Expectations

#### Current Max Performance

**CFO Skaruppa:**
> "Max is now **9% of our subscribers**. It **doubled in Q3 year over year** in terms of bookings. So you know, it's clearly doing well in that regard. It's **underperforming our lofty expectations** for it, though."

**Renewal Rates:**
> "Max right now, again, it's they're still small as they've been ramping up, but was renewing **slightly better than Super**. But it's early, and Q4 is a relatively cohort. Relatively sizable cohort. So we'll talk about this again on the next call."

**Strategic Response:**
1. **Guided Video Calls:** Make Max more accessible to beginners (largest user cohort)
2. **Increased Advertising:** Not yet promoting guided calls to non-subscribers
3. **Feature Expansion:** Adding more AI-powered features to justify premium pricing

**Implication:** Max will remain a focus area, but management not expecting Max to "save" Q4 bookings growth. Breakthrough likely in 2026 once guided calls launch.

---

### Cost & Efficiency Outlook

#### AI Costs Declining

**CEO von Ahn:**
> "In terms of cost, look. **Costs are coming down. They've come down just without us doing anything.** For us, this has not been the top priority. Optimizing costs. At the moment, the top priority is just making the best possible experience for our users that teaches the best and that is the most engaging."

**Why Not Optimizing Costs:**
> "We can do that is because **most of our AI features, at least the ones that cost the most money, are behind Duolingo Max**. And because the price of that is, you know, is high enough that we're, you know, for us, the usage of AI is anyways profitable."

**Implication:**
- Gross margin pressure will stabilize or improve as AI costs decline
- Management will not sacrifice user experience to optimize costs (opposite of typical SaaS playbook)
- Max pricing provides cushion to absorb AI cost volatility

---

#### Operating Leverage Continuing

**CFO Skaruppa:**
> "We have made incredible progress towards our **long-term margin** while we've been growing the platform to a scale that has 130 million monthly actives, and we guided to nearly $1.2 billion of bookings this year. So we've shown that we can **scale the business operate with discipline, and expand margins.** And that's great. And we wanna continue to do that."

**But Not Linear:**
> "We are not going to prioritize **linear margin expansion from here.** When we should be we view the opportunity as so big so we can prioritize investing."

**Key Takeaway:**
- Expect **29-30% Adjusted EBITDA margins** to be the "steady state" for next 1-2 years
- Will not push toward 35-40% margins in near term (prioritizing growth over incremental margin)
- Operating leverage will continue, but at slower pace than 2024-2025

## Analyst Comparison: Above, Below, or In-Line?

### Full-Year 2025 Bookings: "Nearly $1.2 Billion" (+33% YoY)
**Assessment:** **In-line to slightly above**
- Management raised guidance from prior quarter (implied)
- Street likely expecting $1.18-1.20B range based on 9M trends
- "Nearly $1.2B" language suggests ~$1.19-1.20B

### Q4 2025 Bookings: Implied ~$373M (+24% YoY)
**Assessment:** **Below expectations**
- Street likely modeling +28-32% growth (extrapolating from Q3's +33%)
- Actual implied growth of +24% represents **400-800 bps miss**
- **This is the key guidance disappointment**

### Full-Year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA Margin: 29%
**Assessment:** **In-line**
- Street expecting 28.5-29.5% range
- 29% is at midpoint of expectations
- Demonstrates continued operating leverage despite investment pivot

### Q4 2025 DAU Growth: "Some amount of deceleration" from +36%
**Assessment:** **In-line**
- Street modeling ~30-32% DAU growth for Q4
- Management guidance of "around 30%" aligns with expectations
- Stabilization narrative is healthy (not concerning)

---

## Key Risks to Guidance (Explicit & Implicit)

### Explicit Risks Mentioned

1. **New Year's Promotion Experimentation (Q4 Variability)**
   - First time testing Energy mechanic in New Year's promo
   - Uncertainty around discount levels, timing, and user response
   - CFO: "Q4 is our most variable quarter"

2. **China Geopolitical Risk**
   - 5-6% of business now in China (second-largest country)
   - Limited marketing spend due to "geopolitical risk"
   - Max launch pending regulatory approvals (could be delayed or denied)

3. **Macro Environment (Implicit)**
   - No explicit macro discussion, but consumer discretionary spending headwinds could pressure conversions
   - Duolingo English Test revenue declined 10% YoY (potential canary in coal mine for broader weakness)

4. **Platform Concentration (Apple)**
   - 61.6% of revenue processed through Apple App Store
   - Any policy changes (e.g., reduced data access, higher take rates) would materially impact economics

---

### Implicit Risks (Not Mentioned, But Evident)

1. **Free-to-Paid Conversion Pressure**
   - Strategic shift deprioritizing conversion optimization experiments
   - Could pressure subscriber growth in 2026 if not offset by improved product

2. **Max Adoption Slower Than Hoped**
   - 9% penetration "underperforming lofty expectations"
   - If guided calls don't move the needle, Max may plateau at 10-12% of subs

3. **Duolingo English Test Decline Continuing**
   - Q3 2025: -10% YoY
   - No management commentary on turnaround strategy
   - Could become ~3% headwind to total revenue growth if decline persists

4. **Valuation Compression Risk**
   - P/E multiple will re-rate now that company is profitable (no longer "growth at any cost" story)
   - If bookings growth decelerates to low-20s% in 2026, stock could face multiple compression

---

## 2026 Outlook (No Official Guidance, But Strong Signals)

**Management Did Not Provide Explicit 2026 Guidance** per CFO Skaruppa:
> "We're not really guiding for next year, but we're very excited about a lot of the initiatives that we're gonna put out in the product for next year."

### Product Roadmap Signals for 2026

**Strong Positive Indicators:**
1. **Guided Video Calls** (Q1-Q2 2026 launch)
2. **Chess PVP Full Rollout** (Q4 2025/Q1 2026)
3. **Math Full Curriculum** (Q1-Q2 2026)
4. **Music Course Revamp** (2026)
5. **Top 9 Languages to B2 Level** (Q1-Q2 2026)
6. **Social Features Expansion** (2026)
7. **China Max Launch** (Q4 2025/Q1 2026)

**Revenue/Bookings Trajectory:**
- **2025 Full-Year:** ~$1.2B bookings (+33%)
- **2026 Implied:** Management avoiding commitment, but likely +20-25% bookings growth
  - Strategic shift prioritizing DAUs will pressure near-term bookings
  - Product launches in H1 2026 could re-accelerate growth in H2 2026
  - **Base case:** $1.44-1.50B bookings (+20-25%)
  - **Bull case:** $1.54B+ bookings (+28%+) if product launches drive conversion surge

**DAU Trajectory:**
- **2025 Exit Rate:** ~30% YoY growth (Sept/Oct run rate)
- **2026 Implied:** Management wants "growing DAUs fast for a very long time"
  - **Base case:** 25-30% DAU growth sustained through 2026
  - **Bull case:** Re-acceleration to 32-35% if product improvements drive retention

**Profitability:**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Likely 29-30% range (flat to slight expansion)
- **Free Cash Flow:** Continued strong FCF generation (30-35% FCF margin)
- **No Margin Expansion Priority:** Management willing to sacrifice 100-200 bps of margin to invest in growth

---

## Summary: Guidance Interpretation & Investment Implications

### The Good
✅ **Full-year 2025 guidance raised** (bookings to ~$1.2B, +33% YoY)  
✅ **Adjusted EBITDA margin stable at 29%** despite growth investments  
✅ **DAU growth stabilizing at healthy ~30% YoY** (not collapsing)  
✅ **Robust product roadmap for 2026** (guided calls, chess PVP, expanded curriculum)  
✅ **China optionality** (5-6% of business, Max launch pending)  
✅ **AI cost tailwinds** (costs declining without optimization efforts)  

### The Bad
❌ **Q4 2025 bookings growth decelerating to +24%** (vs. +33% in Q3)  
❌ **Strategic shift creates near-term bookings headwind** (Q4 2025 and likely H1 2026)  
❌ **Max underperforming expectations** (9% penetration, slower adoption than hoped)  
❌ **Duolingo English Test revenue declining** (-10% YoY, no turnaround strategy disclosed)  
❌ **No explicit 2026 guidance** (creates uncertainty for modeling)  

### The Ugly
⚠️ **Management tone suggests 2026 bookings growth could decelerate further** if product launches don't drive conversion  
⚠️ **Free-to-paid conversion pressure** from deprioritizing monetization experiments  
⚠️ **High execution risk** on 2026 product roadmap (guided calls, chess PVP, etc. must all land successfully)  

---

## Bottom Line: Guidance as a "Buy" or "Sell" Signal?

### For Growth-at-Reasonable-Price (GARP) Investors: **SELL Signal**
- Bookings growth decelerating from 33% → 24% is a red flag
- Strategic pivot creates 2-4 quarter "investment trough" with unclear payoff timing
- Valuation likely to compress as Street re-rates growth expectations downward

### For Long-Term TAM Expansion Believers: **BUY Signal**
- Management making right long-term trade-off (sacrificing near-term for sustainable growth)
- AI-driven product roadmap could unlock "billions of users" TAM (vs. 135M MAUs today)
- 29% EBITDA margins prove business model works at scale; growth investments are self-funded

### For Show-Me Investors: **HOLD/WAIT**
- Wait for Q4 2025 results to confirm whether deceleration is temporary or structural
- Monitor guided video call launch impact on Max adoption (key Q1-Q2 2026 catalyst)
- Re-evaluate after 2026 guidance is provided (February 2026 earnings call)

**Key Quote (CFO Skaruppa):**
> "We're going to be acting for a while like there is a humongous opportunity because there is one. And, you know, until we get it. But I think we're going to be seeing good results from this even, you know, much sooner than that. So it's not like our, you know, we're saying, oh, throw away all the bookings or anything like that."

**Translation:** Management is confident the strategic pivot will pay off "much sooner" than a multi-year timeline, but they're not providing specifics. This is both reassuring (they believe in the strategy) and concerning (no quantifiable milestones to hold them accountable).
