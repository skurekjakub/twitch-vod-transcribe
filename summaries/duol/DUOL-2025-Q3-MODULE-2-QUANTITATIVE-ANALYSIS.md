### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | YoY Change | 9M 2025 | 9M 2024 | YoY Change |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Basic EPS** | **$6.36** | $0.53 | **+$5.83** | **$8.17** | $1.73 | **+$6.44** |
| **Diluted EPS** | **$5.95** | $0.49 | **+$5.46** | **$7.63** | $1.57 | **+$6.06** |
| Adjusted EPS (ex-tax benefit)* | ~$1.51 | $0.53 | +$0.98 | ~$3.28 | $1.73 | +$1.55 |

**Share Count:**
- Basic Weighted Average Shares (Q3 2025): 45.95M vs. 43.71M (Q3 2024) = +5.1% dilution
- Diluted Weighted Average Shares (Q3 2025): 49.14M vs. 47.97M (Q3 2024) = +2.4% dilution
- Shares Outstanding (Sept 30, 2025): 46.11M (39.99M Class A + 6.12M Class B)

### Revenue by Product Type
Duolingo operates as a **single reportable segment** per 10-Q. Revenue disaggregated by product type:

**Q3 2025 Revenue Mix:**
- Subscription: $229.5M (84.5% of total)
- Advertising: $21.0M (7.7%)
- Duolingo English Test: $9.6M (3.5%)
- In-App Purchases: $11.1M (4.1%)
- Other: $0.5M (0.2%)

**9M 2025 Revenue Mix:**
- Subscription: $631.2M (83.6% of total)

Management did not address DET revenue decline on call. Possible factors:
1. Normalization post-pandemic test-taking surge
2. Competition from other English proficiency tests (TOEFL, IELTS)
3. Seasonality (Q3 may be off-peak for test-taking)

- Apple: 61.6% of total revenue processed
- Google: 23.5%

**Accounts Receivable Concentration (Sept 30, 2025):**
- Apple: 68.4% of total AR

## Risk Factors Identified in Quantitative Data

1. **Bookings Growth Deceleration:** Q4 implied bookings growth of +24% YoY represents material slowdown from Q3's +33% and 9M's +37%

2. **Gross Margin Compression:** 40 bps decline in Q3, 100 bps decline in 9M, indicating cost pressures from AI and payment processing fees

3. **Duolingo English Test Decline:** -10% YoY in Q3 2025, potential headwind if trend continues

4. **Platform Concentration Risk:** 61.6% of revenue processed through Apple, creating dependence on single partner

5. **Share Dilution:** 2.6% dilution in 9 months, with $101M in SBC expense (13% of revenue)

6. **China Geopolitical Risk:** 5-6% of business in China with limited marketing spend, vulnerable to regulatory changes

7. **Max Underperformance:** 9% of subs despite doubling YoY bookings, suggests slower-than-expected adoption of premium tier

8. **Free-to-Paid Conversion Pressure:** Strategic shift deprioritizing conversion optimization experiments may pressure subscriber growth in 2026

## Bottom Line: The Numbers Story

**Strong Q3 Operating Performance, But Q4 Guidance Signals Deceleration:**
- Revenue, EBITDA, and DAU growth all beat/met expectations in Q3
- One-time $222.7M tax benefit boosted reported EPS to $6.36 but is non-recurring
- Normalized Q3 EPS of ~$1.51 still represents strong operational profitability
- **Key concern:** Q4 implied bookings growth of +24% YoY is a significant deceleration from recent trends, driven by management's strategic shift toward long-term user growth over near-term monetization

**Margin Expansion Despite Heavy Investment:**
- Adjusted EBITDA margin reached 29.5% (at target range), demonstrating operating leverage
- FCF margin of 35.3% for 9M 2025 shows strong cash conversion
- SBC expense of 13% of revenue is high but declining as % of revenue (was 15% in 2024)

**User Growth Remains Strong, But Stabilizing:**
- DAUs grew 36% YoY in Q3, but management noted stabilization at ~30% in Sept/Oct
- Engagement improving (DAU/MAU ratio up 440 bps to 37.3%)
- Paid subscriber growth (+34% YoY) slightly lagging DAU growth, indicating free-to-paid conversion pressure

**Balance Sheet Fortress:**
- $1.2B in total liquidity, zero debt
- $266.7M FCF generated in 9M 2025
- $441.7M in deferred revenue provides strong forward revenue visibility

**The Strategic Trade-Off:**
Management is deliberately sacrificing near-term bookings growth (Q4 +24% vs. Q3 +33%) to invest in long-term user growth and AI-driven product improvements. Whether this trade-off pays off will determine if the stock re-rates higher (TAM expansion story) or compresses (bookings growth slowdown story).
