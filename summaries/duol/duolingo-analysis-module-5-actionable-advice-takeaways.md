## Core Investment Principles

### 1. Never Let Stock Price Movements Dictate Your Opinion of Business Quality

**The Principle:**
> "I noticed something with this company in particular and that is that investors do what investors end up doing for every situation like this which I think is a mistake. They let the stock price movement inform them of their opinion on the stock."

**Why It Matters:**
- Stock prices reflect short-term sentiment, not always fundamental value
- Panic selling during drawdowns locks in losses and misses recoveries
- Historical examples (Netflix -75%, Amazon to $80) show extreme price movements can reverse

**How to Apply:**
- Conduct fundamental analysis **before** looking at recent price action
- Ask: "If this stock had gone up 10% on the same news, would I think it was a good quarter?"
- Monitor business metrics (users, revenue, margins) independently of stock price
- Use price declines as opportunities to re-evaluate thesis, not automatic sell signals

**The Counterfactual Test:**
> "I believe in an alternate world. If you had this result and the stock price, for whatever reason, went up 10%. But nothing changed. Not the bookings, not the growth rate, none of these metrics, I believe that most investors would look at this company and say, 'This was a great quarter.'"

### 2. Size Positions According to Uncertainty, Not Enthusiasm

**The Principle:**
> "I intentionally put it [Duolingo] as a smaller position because I recognize the inherent risk and volatility in the company."

**Position Sizing Framework:**

**Large Positions (10-15%):**
- Established business models (Google, Amazon)
- Proven competitive moats
- Lower volatility
- Narrow outcome distributions

**Small Positions (1-3%):**
- Earlier-stage companies (Duolingo)
- Growth-dependent theses
- Higher volatility
- Wide outcome distributions

**Why It Matters:**
> "In that case, Netflix was my biggest position. So, that was a pretty tragic event for my portfolio. In this case, Duelingo is my smallest position. It is not a tragic event."

**How to Apply:**
- Before buying, assess: volatility level, business maturity, outcome certainty
- High conviction does NOT automatically mean large position
- Ask: "Can I hold this through a 50% drawdown without panic selling?"
- If no, size smaller until the answer is yes

**The Risk Management Outcome:**
Duolingo fell 50%, but portfolio NAV only declined 1% because position was sized at 2%

### 3. Focus on Building/Identifying "Heavy Companies"

**The Principle:**
> "The goal for entrepreneurs like Lewis the CEO and founder of Dualingo is to forget about the stock price you don't have any control over that, then that's the long-term output of what you do have control over, which is the fundamentals, making a heavy company."

**What Makes a Company "Heavy":**
- Large, engaged user base
- Strong unit economics
- Durable competitive moat
- Ability to generate substantial cash flow at scale
- Management focused on long-term value creation

**How to Evaluate:**
Ask the Ben Graham question:
> "In the short term the stock market is a voting machine in the long term it's a weighing machine."

**For Duolingo specifically:**
> "Will it become a heavy company. Will it become a big, large, established, profitable company or not? If you don't believe it will, then don't buy the stock."

**Application:**
- Track fundamental metrics (users, engagement, revenue, margins) over time
- Ignore quarterly stock price fluctuations
- Hold winners as long as fundamentals continue improving
- Sell only when fundamentals deteriorate, not when price falls

---

### 4. Understand Platform Company Evolution Patterns

**The Pattern:**

**Phase 1: Growth Over Profits**
- Sacrifice near-term monetization
- Focus on user acquisition and engagement
- Accept losses or margin compression
- Market often panics during this phase

**Phase 2: Scale Achievement**
- Reach critical mass (network effects kick in)
- Establish market dominance
- Build competitive moat through data/brand

**Phase 3: Monetization**
- "Turn the screws" on conversion, pricing
- Margins expand dramatically
- FCF inflection
- Stock re-rates upward

**Historical Examples:**
- **Uber:** Unprofitable for years → achieved scale → now highly profitable
- **Netflix:** Burned cash building library → dominant streaming platform → FCF positive
- **Amazon:** $80/share during capex investment → infrastructure pays off → $240/share
- **Spotify:** "Broken business model" concerns → achieved scale → profitable

**Application to Duolingo:**
> "What we mean is that what we decorizing user growth over monetization in this type of of judgment call."

CEO is explicitly choosing Phase 1 strategy (user growth) over Phase 3 (monetization) because he sees a "unique moment in time" opportunity with AI transformation of education.

**How to Invest:**
- Identify which phase company is in
- For Phase 1 companies: Monitor user growth, engagement, competitive position (NOT revenue/margins)
- Be patient - this phase can last 3-5+ years
- Size positions small enough to tolerate volatility
- Add to position if fundamentals improve while price falls

### 5. When Growth Stocks "Rerate," Investigate Rather Than Panic

**The Rerating Mechanism:**
> "Anytime a highly rated stock, one that's trading at a higher multiple, has any concerns with its growth, investors sell out of the stock. They rate it much lower. And that's what we're seeing happen here. So, this is clearly a rerating event."

**What Triggers Rerating:**
- Growth guidance below expectations
- Deceleration in key metrics
- Competitive threats (perceived or real)
- Macro concerns affecting growth outlook

**How to Respond:**

**Step 1: Determine if it's temporary or permanent**

**Temporary Rerating Indicators:**
- Management explains strategic rationale for slowdown
- Current metrics still strong (MAU, DAU, engagement improving)
- Company has levers to re-accelerate if needed
- Competitive position intact

**Permanent Rerating Indicators:**
- Business model broken (tech disruption, regulatory change)
- Competitive losses (market share declining)
- Management has no credible plan
- Customer churn increasing

**Step 2: Act accordingly**

**If Temporary:**
> "As long as I see that happen [metrics improving], I'm not going to sell the stock. And in fact, I may dollar cost average and buy a bit more."

**If Permanent:**
Exit position and redeploy capital

**Duolingo's Case:**
All current metrics improving (MAU +20%, DAU +6%, subs +34%, revenue +45%) → Temporary rerating → Hold or add

## Specific Trading/Investment Rules

### Rule 1: Don't Sell Winners Based on Volatility Alone

**The Situation:**
Duolingo down 50% from highs, creating temptation to "cut losses"

**The Rule:**
> "I don't like it when my stocks go down. I want all my investments to do well, including Dualingo, including even my small positions. I put the $20,000 into this stock because I want to make money with it."

But selling is only justified if fundamentals deteriorate.

**When to Sell:**
- ❌ Stock down 30-50% (price-based)
- ✅ DAU declining for 2+ quarters (fundamental deterioration)
- ✅ Subscriber churn accelerating (business quality decline)
- ✅ Competitive displacement evident (moat erosion)

**When to Hold or Add:**
> "I'm seeing the metrics go up and to the right for Duolingo. As long as I see that happen, I'm not going to sell the stock."

---

### Rule 2: Tax Considerations Are Secondary to Investment Thesis

**The Temptation:**
> "Do we sell out of the position? Do we accept our losses, do some tax loss harvesting, and move on?"

**The Decision:**
Carlson chose NOT to tax-loss harvest because fundamentals support holding

**The Principle:**
- Tax benefits are a 15-25% improvement (depending on tax rate)
- Getting the investment decision right is a 100-500%+ difference
- Don't let the tax tail wag the investment dog

**Application:**
Consider tax-loss harvesting only when:
1. You want to exit the position anyway (thesis broken)
2. You can buy a highly correlated substitute (avoid wash sale) while maintaining exposure
3. The tax benefit is substantial relative to position size

---

### Rule 3: Use Dollar-Cost Averaging for High-Conviction, High-Volatility Positions

**The Strategy:**
> "I may dollar cost average and buy a bit more."

**When to DCA:**
- High conviction in long-term thesis
- Stock experiencing extreme volatility
- Fundamentals improving while price declining
- Can't predict exact bottom (no one can)

**How to Implement:**
- Set predetermined schedule (e.g., add 20% more every quarter for 4 quarters if DAU growing)
- Or set price triggers (e.g., add if stock falls another 20% and DAU still growing)
- Never add more than planned maximum position size
- Stop adding immediately if fundamental thesis breaks

**Duolingo Application:**
Original position: 2% of portfolio
Could DCA up to: 3-4% of portfolio if fundamentals continue improving
Maximum ever: Likely 5% given uncertainty level

---

### Rule 4: Monitor Leading Indicators, Not Just Financial Metrics

**For Platform/Subscription Companies:**

**Leading Indicators (Predict Future Performance):**
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Engagement intensity (DAU/MAU ratio)
- User retention cohorts
- Net promoter scores / customer satisfaction
- Product feature adoption rates

**Lagging Indicators (Reflect Past Performance):**
- Revenue growth
- Earnings per share
- Free cash flow

**Why It Matters:**
> "Right now the revenue that Dualingo is receiving this quarter is bookings they got last year."

Revenue today reflects decisions made 12+ months ago. DAU/MAU today predict revenue 12+ months from now.

**Application:**
If DAU growing +20% while stock falling on weak bookings guidance → Opportunity (leading indicators strong)

If DAU declining while revenue still growing → Warning (lagging indicators misleading)

---

## Portfolio Construction Wisdom

### Diversification Across Risk Profiles

**Carlson's Portfolio Structure:**

**Core Holdings (60-70% of portfolio):**
- Google (13%)
- Amazon (11%)
- Netflix (10%)
- S&P Global (9-10%)
- Microsoft (unknown %)

**Characteristics:**
- Established business models
- Proven moats
- Lower (relative) volatility
- Steady compounders

**Satellite Holdings (20-30% of portfolio):**
- Duolingo (<1%)
- Equifax (3%)
- Texas Roadhouse (3%)
- Others

**Characteristics:**
- Higher growth potential
- Higher volatility
- Earlier-stage or more speculative theses
- Sized small enough to tolerate failures

**The Benefit:**
> "If Dualingo doesn't work out, it'll be a bummer, but it's not going to impact my portfolio's performance to a massive degree."

Portfolio can tolerate individual failures in satellite holdings while core holdings compound steadily.

---

### Theme-Based Investing

**Carlson's Core Theme:**

> "You'll also notice a theme that they're almost always subscription-based companies or they're data companies. They offer products that people use for a very long period of time. So they're not very transactional companies."

**The Criteria:**
- Subscription or recurring revenue models
- Products customers use daily or multiple times per week
- High lifetime value
- Low churn / high retention
- Network effects or data moats

**Examples:**
- **Google:** Daily use (search, Gmail, YouTube)
- **Amazon:** Repeat purchases, Prime membership
- **Netflix:** Daily/weekly streaming habits
- **Duolingo:** Daily language learning streaks
- **Microsoft:** Office suite, enterprise software

**Why This Theme:**
- Predictable revenue streams
- Customer switching costs
- Compound value over time
- Less dependent on macroeconomic cycles

**Application:**
When evaluating new investments, ask:
1. Will customers use this product repeatedly over years?
2. Does the product get better with more usage (data flywheel)?
3. Is there high pain/cost to switching away?
4. Can the company expand monetization over time?

If yes to most → Fits portfolio theme

## Warnings & Risk Management

### Warning 1: Beware of Management Teams That Deflect Rather Than Address Problems

**The Chipotle Example:**

**Problem:** Declining revenue per location, customer complaints about portion inconsistency

**Management's Response:**
> "Our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations due to persistent macroeconomic pressures."

**Carlson's Critique:**
> "That certainly is a factor. I'll admit that it plays into any restaurant, but there's also a big factor that you do have control over."

**Red Flags:**
- Blaming macro conditions for operational failures
- Ignoring obvious, fixable problems
- Refusing to acknowledge customer complaints
- No concrete action plan to improve

**Green Flags (Duolingo Counter-Example):**
- CEO directly addressing competitive threats (AI, translation)
- Articulating clear strategic rationale for disappointing metrics
- Providing specific examples (energy units) of intentional choices
- Transparent about trade-offs (monetization vs. user growth)

**Application:**
Listen to earnings calls not just for the numbers, but for:
- How management frames problems
- Whether they take ownership
- Quality of strategic thinking
- Honesty about challenges

---

### Warning 2: High Growth Rates Don't Guarantee Success

**The Context:**
Duolingo has impressive growth metrics (MAU +20%, DAU growing, subs +34%, revenue +45%), yet stock fell 29%

**The Lesson:**
Growth companies must also demonstrate:
- **Path to profitability** (unit economics work at scale)
- **Competitive moat** (sustainable advantages)
- **TAM expansion** (room to grow for many years)
- **Capital efficiency** (don't need infinite funding rounds)

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Can this company ever be profitable? (Netflix was asked this for years)
2. What happens when growth slows? (Duolingo is experiencing this now)
3. Is management prioritizing right metrics? (User growth vs. revenue)
4. Can they "turn the screws" on monetization when ready?

---

### Warning 3: Position Size Determines Your Ability to Think Clearly

**The Psychological Reality:**

**Too Large:**
> "In that case, Netflix was my biggest position. So, that was a pretty tragic event for my portfolio... That was really stressful. That was not a fun thing to have happen."

When position is too large:
- Emotional attachment clouds judgment
- Volatility causes anxiety, poor decision-making
- Likely to panic sell at bottoms
- Miss opportunities to add at attractive prices

**Appropriately Sized:**
> "In this case, Duelingo is my smallest position. It is not a tragic event. This isn't something that's really going to impact the portfolio performance over the long term."

When position is right-sized:
- Can evaluate fundamentals rationally
- Volatility is tolerable
- Opportunity to add if thesis strengthens
- Clear thinking during stress

**The Rule:**
If a position keeps you up at night or causes you to check the price constantly, **it's too large regardless of your conviction level**.

## Specific Predictions & Market Views

### On Duolingo's Future

**Thesis:**
> "I still believe there's a good chance for upside because like Jeff Bezos says, I'm looking at the fundamentals. I'm seeing the metrics go up and to the right for Duolingo."

**Action Plan:**
- **Hold** current position
- **Monitor** DAU, MAU, engagement metrics quarterly
- **Consider adding** if metrics continue improving for 2+ quarters while stock remains depressed
- **Sell** only if fundamentals deteriorate (DAU decline, churn increase, competitive losses)

**Time Horizon:** Multi-year (3-5+)

**Success Case:** Duolingo reaches hundreds of millions or billions of users, becomes dominant education platform

**Failure Case:** Stuck at 50-150M users, niche language app, unable to monetize at scale

---

### On Google's Trajectory

**Conviction Level:** Highest (13% position, largest in portfolio)

**Thesis:**
> "I've never seen so many good things going on with a single stock. It's incredible. And this is just one more thing to add to the list."

**Growth Vectors:**
- Search/advertising (core cash cow)
- Cloud (fast-growing, gaining share)
- YouTube (dominant video platform)
- Waymo (autonomous vehicles)
- AI infrastructure (TPU chips)
- AI models (Gemini)

**No specific price target, but implied action: Hold for years/decades**

---

### On Market Behavior During Rerating Events

**Pattern Recognition:**

**The Setup:**
1. High-multiple growth stock misses guidance
2. Violent sell-off (20-50%+)
3. Analysts downgrade, reduce price targets
4. Retail investors panic and sell
5. Narrative shifts from "can't lose" to "broken story"

**The Opportunity:**
6. Fundamentals often still improving
7. Management making intentional strategic choices
8. Market overreacting to near-term noise
9. Patient investors can accumulate at depressed prices

**The Resolution (If Thesis Correct):**
10. Company executes on strategy over 2-4 years
11. Metrics inflect positively
12. Stock re-rates upward violently
13. Rewarding investors who bought during pessimism

**Historical Examples:**
- Netflix (2020-2022)
- Amazon (2022)
- Uber (multiple times)
- Spotify (multiple times)

**Current Example:**
Duolingo (November 2024)

## Key Takeaways Summary

### The Investment Decision Framework

**1. Separate Price from Value**
Don't let stock movements dictate your opinion of business quality

**2. Size for Uncertainty**
Position sizing reflects risk level, not just conviction level

**3. Monitor Leading Indicators**
DAU, MAU, engagement predict future better than current revenue

**4. Understand Company Phase**
Platform companies in growth phase sacrifice near-term profits

**5. Investigate Rerating Events**
Violent sell-offs can create opportunities if fundamentals intact

**6. Hold Winners**
Sell only when fundamentals break, not when prices fall

**7. Build Heavy Companies (or Invest in Them)**
Focus on long-term value creation, ignore short-term price voting

**8. Diversify Risk Profiles**
Core stable holdings + smaller satellite high-risk/high-reward positions

**9. Evaluate Management Quality**
Look for honest communication, strategic thinking, customer focus

**10. Think in Years, Not Quarters**
Best returns come from patience during volatility

---

## The Ultimate Lesson

> "What investors do in these specific scenarios, in these exact situations where a stock like Dualingo sells off dramatically, what we do now can in many cases determine your future returns to a huge extent."

The highest-return opportunities emerge during periods of maximum fear and uncertainty. But capitalizing on them requires:

1. **Analytical Capability:** Independently evaluating fundamentals vs. sentiment
2. **Emotional Discipline:** Acting contrary to panic when analysis supports it
3. **Risk Management:** Position sizing that enables rational decision-making
4. **Patience:** Multi-year time horizons to allow theses to play out

Those who master these four elements can turn market dislocations (like Duolingo's -29% day) into generational wealth-building opportunities.

Those who don't will buy at tops (when sentiment is euphoric) and sell at bottoms (when sentiment is despairing), permanently destroying wealth.

**The choice is yours.**
