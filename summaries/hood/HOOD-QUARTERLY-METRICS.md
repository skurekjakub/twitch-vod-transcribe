### Valuation Ratios

#### Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
- **Trailing P/E (TTM):** $125.00 / $2.11 = **59.2x**
- **Forward P/E (2026E):** $125.00 / $1.80 (base case EPS) = **69.4x**
- **Forward P/E (2027E):** $125.00 / $3.25 (bull case EPS) = **38.5x**

#### Price-to-Sales (P/S)
- **Current P/S (TTM):** $112.3B / $4,400M = **25.5x**
- **Forward P/S (2026E):** $112.3B / $5,700M = **19.7x**

#### Price-to-Book (P/B)
- **Total Equity (from 10-Q):** $10,458M (Sept 30, 2025)
- **Book Value per Share:** $10,458M / 898.7M = **$11.64**
- **Price-to-Book:** $125.00 / $11.64 = **10.7x**
- **Tangible Book Value:** $10,458M - Intangibles (estimated ~$500M) = $9,958M
- **Price-to-Tangible Book:** $125.00 / ($9,958M / 898.7M) = **11.3x**

#### Enterprise Value (EV)
- **Market Cap (diluted):** $112.3B
- **Cash & Equivalents (from 10-Q):** $6,395M
- **Debt (from 10-Q):** $0 (no long-term debt disclosed)

- **EV/Revenue (TTM):** $105.9B / $4,400M = **24.1x**
- **EV/EBITDA (TTM estimated):** $105.9B / $2,000M = **53.0x**

### Profitability Metrics (for context)
- **Q3 Net Margin:** 43.6% ($556M / $1,274M)
- **Q3 Operating Margin (estimated):** 48.8% (income before tax $634M / revenue $1,274M)

## Valuation Analysis

### Historical Context
- **Typical Fintech Multiples:**
  - P/E: 15-25x (mature), 30-50x (high-growth)
  - P/S: 3-8x (mature), 10-20x (high-growth)
  - P/B: 2-5x (asset-light fintech)
  
- **HOOD Current Multiples vs. Category:**
  - **P/E 59x:** Trading at 2-3x high-growth fintech multiple → **very expensive**
  - **P/S 25.5x:** Trading at 2.5x high-growth fintech multiple → **very expensive**
  - **P/B 10.7x:** Trading at 2x typical fintech P/B → **expensive**

### Implied Market Expectations (Reverse Engineering)

**What is the market pricing in?**

Using current P/E of 59x on TTM EPS $2.11:
- If market expects 25x P/E (high-growth fintech), implies: **$52.75 stock price**
- If market expects 40x P/E (hyper-growth SaaS-like), implies: **$84.40 stock price**
- **Current price $125** implies market is pricing either:
  - P/E ~60x (current) on belief of sustained 30-40% EPS CAGR for 5+ years, OR
  - Forward-looking to 2027-2028 when EPS could be $5-6 (P/E 20-25x on future earnings)

**Using DCF Reverse Engineering:**
At $125/share ($112.3B market cap), assuming:
- 10% discount rate (WACC)
- 15% terminal growth rate (aggressive for any company)
- **Implied 2030 EBITDA:** ~$8-10B (to justify current price)
- **2025 EBITDA (estimated):** ~$2B
- **Required CAGR:** ~32-38% for 5 years

**Conclusion:** Market is pricing in **sustained hyper-growth (30%+ revenue/EBITDA CAGR) through 2030** AND **sustained high margins (40%+ net margin)**. This is an extremely bullish scenario.

### Risk/Reward from $125
- **Bull Case Target:** $75-105 → **-40% to -16% return** (DOWNSIDE from current)
- **Bear Case Target:** $8-13 → **-94% to -90% return** (catastrophic downside)
- **Base Case Target:** $40-50 (revised for $125 context) → **-68% to -60% return**

**Interpretation:** At $125, HOOD is **significantly overvalued** relative to analyst base/bull cases. Stock price appears to be pricing in an **ultra-bull scenario** not contemplated in original analysis (e.g., all new products succeed, international scales faster than expected, 50%+ EPS CAGR through 2028).

### Comparable Company Analysis (Q3 2025 estimates)

| Metric | HOOD | Coinbase (COIN) | SoFi (SOFI) | Schwab (SCHW) | Interactive Brokers (IBKR) |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **P/E (TTM)** | 59.2x | ~25x | NM (unprofitable) | ~20x | ~18x |
| **P/S (TTM)** | 25.5x | ~8x | ~3x | ~4x | ~5x |
| **P/B** | 10.7x | ~3x | ~2x | ~2.5x | ~1.5x |
| **Net Margin** | 43.6% | ~35% | Negative | ~25% | ~40% |
| **Revenue Growth (YoY)** | 100% | ~80% | ~25% | ~5% | ~20% |

**HOOD trades at 2-3x premium to peers on every metric** despite comparable/inferior moats vs. Coinbase (crypto) and Schwab (scale). Premium only justified if market believes HOOD will grow 2-3x faster than peers for 5+ years.

## Notes for Future Quarters

### What to Track
1. **P/E compression/expansion:** Is market re-rating HOOD toward peer multiples (15-25x) or sustaining premium?
2. **EPS growth trajectory:** Is 2026-2027 EPS actually hitting $1.80-3.00+ to justify current price?
3. **Revenue mix shift:** Does Gold subscription % increase (justifies higher multiple) or does crypto % stay high (justifies lower multiple)?
4. **Comparable multiple convergence:** Do peers re-rate up (lifting all boats) or does HOOD compress down?

### Red Flags to Monitor
- **P/E >70x:** Suggests irrational exuberance or meme stock behavior
- **P/S >30x:** Suggests market is ignoring near-term fundamentals entirely
- **EV/EBITDA >60x:** Suggests growth expectations are unrealistic

### Green Flags to Monitor
- **P/E compression to 40x while EPS grows 50%+:** Healthy de-rating as earnings catch up to valuation
- **P/B declining while book value grows:** Suggests market becoming more reasonable
- **ROE >25%:** Validates high P/B multiple (premium to book justified by returns)
