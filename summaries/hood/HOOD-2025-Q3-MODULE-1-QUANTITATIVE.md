---

## Analyst Observations

### What's Working
1. **Operating leverage is exceptional:** Revenue +65% YTD vs. modest expense growth → 75% incremental EBITDA margins
2. **Product velocity accelerating:** Multiple new products scaling to material revenue ($100M+) within 12 months
3. **Customer acquisition quality improving:** 40% of new customers adopting Gold (vs. 14% base rate)
4. **Cross-sell execution:** Assets growing faster than accounts (wallet share gains)

### Key Risks to Monitor
1. **Expense guidance variance:** $40M above midpoint in Q3; FY number now "around $2.28B" with qualifier "could be higher or lower"
2. **Lack of specific GAAP metrics:** No explicit EPS, gross margin, or operating income figures
3. **Reliance on volatile revenue streams:** Crypto and Prediction Markets sensitive to market conditions
4. **International still nascent:** Despite ambitious targets, international is still small base

### Missing Data Points
- ~~Specific GAAP EPS for Q3 2025~~ **NOW AVAILABLE: $0.61 diluted, $0.63 basic**
- ~~Gross margin percentage~~ **NOT DISCLOSED** (HOOD doesn't break out COGS separately)
- Customer acquisition costs (CAC) / Lifetime value (LTV) metrics **NOT DISCLOSED**
- Specific guidance for Q4 2025 or FY 2026 **NOT PROVIDED**
- ~~Breakdown of revenue by segment~~ **NOW AVAILABLE: See revenue table above**
- Active trading customers vs. total funded accounts **NOT DISCLOSED**
- **Total customer accounts:** Not disclosed in 10-Q (stated as 27M in earnings call)
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Not disclosed
- **Assets Under Custody (AUC):** Balance sheet shows $41.5B total assets, but true AUC not broken out

## Conclusion

Robinhood delivered a **quantitatively exceptional Q3 2025**, with the 10-Q revealing even stronger metrics than the earnings call suggested:

### **Standout Quantitative Achievements:**

1. **Revenue composition improving:**
   - Transaction-based up 129% (options +50%, crypto +339%, equities +132%)
   - Net interest up 66% (margin +84%, securities lending +358%)
   - Subscription revenue (Gold) up 68% = high-margin recurring base growing

2. **Profitability inflection is real:**
   - Net income $556M in Q3 (vs. $150M Q3'24) = **271% growth**
   - Net margin: **43.6%** (vs. 23.5% Q3'24) = **+20.1 percentage points**
   - YTD net income $1.3B already **2.6x full-year 2024** ($495M)
   - Operating leverage proven: Revenue +100%, OpEx +31% = **true scalability**

3. **Balance sheet signals aggressive growth:**
   - Securities borrowed/loaned **doubled** = securities lending revenue exploded (+358%)
   - User receivables +75% = margin balances at all-time highs
   - Segregated cash +79% = regulatory capital requirements scaling with business
   - Total assets $41.5B (vs. $26.2B EOY'24) = **58% growth in 9 months**

4. **Cash generation exceptional:**
   - Operating cash flow $2.6B YTD (vs. $1.2B prior year) = **+107%**
   - Free cash flow ~$2.5B YTD (minimal capex) = **78% FCF margin**
   - Deployed $553M to buybacks (5.7x prior year pace) = returning capital aggressively

5. **Two new $100M+ businesses validated:**
   - Prediction Markets in "Other transaction-based" (+279% to $72M quarterly)
   - Bitstamp in crypto transaction-based (+339% to $268M, though not all Bitstamp)
   - This brings total to **11 distinct $100M+ revenue lines** = genuine diversification

### **Key Quantitative Concerns:**

1. **Expense growth accelerating:** +31% in Q3 (vs. +21% YTD) suggests cost discipline loosening
   - Marketing +73% = aggressive customer acquisition (could be unsustainable)
   - G&A +39% = partially one-time (CEO award), but still elevated

2. **Securities lending concentration risk:**
   - Revenue up 358% to $87M quarterly = now **7% of total revenue**
   - Highly cyclical and dependent on short interest / IPO activity
   - Could reverse quickly in market downturn

3. **Margin loan exposure:**
   - Receivables from users +75% to $14.4B = credit risk increasing
   - Provision for credit losses only +37% = coverage ratio declining
   - Bear market could trigger margin calls and bad debts

4. **Crypto revenue volatility:**
   - Crypto transaction-based 4.4x YoY = **$268M quarterly**
   - Now **21% of total revenue** (vs. 10% Q3'24)
   - Highly correlated to BTC/ETH prices (which are at cycle highs)

5. **Tax rate normalizing:**
   - ETR 12.3% in Q3 (vs. 1.9% Q3'24) due to valuation allowance reversal slowing
   - If ETR goes to 21% (statutory), net income would decline ~$70M quarterly

### **Model Implications:**

**Base Case FY2025:**
- Q4 revenue: $1.3-1.4B (similar to Q3) → **FY2025: $4.5-4.6B**
- Q4 net income: $500-600M (slight tax headwind) → **FY2025: $1.8-1.9B**
- **FY2025 EPS: $2.00-2.10 diluted** (vs. YTD $1.39, implying $0.61-0.71 in Q4)

**FY2026 Base Case (from 10-Q data):**
- Revenue: $5.5-6.0B (+20-30% growth, assuming crypto normalizes, pred mkts sustain 50%)
- OpEx: $2.4-2.5B (+5-10% growth, assuming cost discipline returns)
- Net income: $2.0-2.3B (assuming 15-18% ETR)
- **EPS: $2.20-2.50 diluted**

**Valuation at $125/share (Nov 1, 2025):**
- **Current TTM P/E: 59x** (on $2.11 TTM EPS)
- **FY2026 Forward P/E: 50-57x** (on $2.20-2.50 EPS)
- **PEG ratio: 2.0-2.5** (assuming 25% growth) = **significantly overvalued** vs. typical fintech PEG <1.5

## Current Valuation Metrics (Stock Price: $125)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Trailing P/E (TTM)** | 59.2x | **Very expensive** - Trading at 2-3x typical high-growth fintech multiple (20-30x) |
| **Forward P/E (2026E)** | 50-57x | Still expensive even assuming strong earnings growth |
| **Price-to-Sales (TTM)** | 25.5x | **Extreme premium** - Peers trade at 5-10x, high-growth SaaS at 15-20x |
| **Price-to-Book** | 10.7x | **Rich valuation** - Typical fintech 2-5x, premium justified only by high ROE (18%+) |
| **EV/EBITDA (TTM est.)** | 53x | **Very expensive** - Implies sustained 30-40% EBITDA growth for 5+ years |
| **Market Cap** | $112.3B | Larger than Charles Schwab ($85B), approaching Coinbase market cap |

**Peer Comparison (Q3 2025 estimates):**
- **HOOD:** P/E 59x, P/S 25.5x, P/B 10.7x
- **Coinbase (COIN):** P/E ~25x, P/S ~8x, P/B ~3x

### **Final Quantitative Assessment:**

**⚠️ VALUATION DISCONNECT:** The 10-Q data **strongly validates operational excellence** (75% incremental margins, 100% revenue growth, exceptional cash generation), BUT the stock price **dramatically overestimates** the probability of sustained hyper-growth.

**At $125, market is pricing in:**
1. **2028 EPS of $6-8** (3x-4x current), AND
2. **Sustained 30-40% EPS CAGR for 5 years**, AND
3. **All new products succeed** (Banking $500M+, Ventures $200M+, Tokenization $500M+), AND
4. **International scales to 20%+ of revenue by 2028**

**Probability of ALL four happening: <20%**

**Quality of earnings is exceptional** (operating cash flow > net income, low capex, strong balance sheet), but **price has run far ahead of fundamentals**. 

**Recommendation:** Stock is **significantly overvalued at $125**. Fair value range is $40-60 based on 20-25x P/E on 2026E EPS $2.20-2.50. Current price implies an ultra-bull scenario (>30% probability-weighted) that is not supported by base case fundamentals.
