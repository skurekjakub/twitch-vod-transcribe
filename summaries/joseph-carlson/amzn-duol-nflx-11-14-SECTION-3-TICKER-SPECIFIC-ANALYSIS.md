## Section 3: Ticker-Specific Analysis & Trade Ideas

---

## $AMZN - Amazon (PRIMARY POSITION - $5,000 BUY)

**Main Thesis:** Bullish long-term accumulation position based on multi-vertical dominance (#1 in e-commerce and cloud, #3 in advertising, #2 in streaming) with near-term catalysts from AWS re-acceleration above 20% growth and aggressive grocery expansion, combined with long-term margin expansion story through automation and operational efficiency.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Fundamental Evidence - Multi-Vertical Dominance:**

Carlson establishes Amazon's exceptional market positioning across multiple high-growth verticals:

**E-Commerce Leadership:** **"Amazon is the biggest online retailer by far. They have a dominant market position. They're number one in the world."**

**Cloud Dominance with Scale Advantage:** **"Then you have cloud hosting. Guess what company's number one in the world? It's Amazon. AWS is much bigger than Azure and Google. We read headlines that Google and Azure is growing faster. And while that's true, we don't read as many headlines that really emphasize the size and scale difference of AWS to either Azure or Google Cloud."**

The quantitative scale difference: **"Azure and Google Cloud have far fewer customers. It's estimated that Amazon has millions, multiple millions of customers. Google is just surpassing 1 million."** This customer diversification provides revenue stability and reduces concentration risk compared to Azure, which has "most of Azure's cloud is from a few companies that are really large."

**Advertising Positioning:** **"Then you have advertising. You have Google as number one. Meta is number two. Then you have Amazon as number three... they have by far the most intent driven ads in the world. Meaning that when people go to amazon.com, their intent is to buy something."**

The strategic advantage: **"So even though they're in third place, they're not in a situation like Meta or Google where you go to their websites for one reason and they have to try to convince you to buy something when that wasn't your intent. With Amazon, you're going to their place to buy something. That makes their ads far more lucrative."**

**Streaming Scale:** **"But then you add on top of that Prime Video, which Prime Video, by the way, is likely number two in the world in streaming behind Netflix, which has massive ad reach, more ad reach than any platform today."**

**Summary of Dominance:** **"So Amazon's number one in online retail, number one in cloud hosting, number three in online ads, and number two in online video streaming. We have a company that's dominant and near the top of the pack in multiple verticals."**

**Technical Evidence - AWS Re-acceleration Catalyst:**

The primary near-term catalyst centers on AWS growth inflecting back above 20%:

**"In their last earnings report... AWS on a quarterly basis and you can see it grow over time and then most importantly the most recent quarter, it re-accelerated growth beyond 20%."**

Carlson's forward-looking conviction: **"The near-term catalyst I see in Amazon and the reason that I'm buying it today is they're going to continue growing AWS and accelerating their growth. I think that more capacity is going to come online. I believe that next quarter it's going to grow above 20%. I think it will continue to re-accelerate."**

The market implication: **"Investors will have a hard time selling the stock off when AWS is growing at a more accelerated pace."**

**Strategic Evidence - Grocery as Trojan Horse for Subscriptions:**

Carlson develops a sophisticated thesis around grocery expansion as a subscription driver, using Costco and Walmart as proof-of-concept:

**The Costco Framework:** **"An example we can look at that's a great company that's in grocery today is Costco. Costco is a grocery company... Costco, a grocery company, trades at a 46 forward PE. Well, that's a little bit of a head scratcher. Shouldn't a low margin, terrible business like grocery trade at a super low PE ratio?"**

The answer: **"No, because we know that what these companies do is they use something that people need every single day. They need to eat. They need groceries every single day. People need this. It's a part of life. It's one of the human connections that these companies are going to have and have long lifetime value by you constantly needing groceries. They use that and they wrap that customer loyalty and consistency into a bigger business model, a better one. They attach it to subscriptions."**

**The High-Return Characteristic:** **"Costco maintains an incredibly high PE ratio because it has high returns on capital employed meaning it can take a small amount of money invest it and get super high returns. It's also a company that has unquestionable moat. It's a company that has unyielding customer loyalty."**

**Walmart Validation:** **"Walmart's a company that actually has the advantage in grocery... Walmart, similar to Costco, trades at a 35 Ford PE. Not quite as high because Walmart isn't quite as membership or subscription driven, but they have that model."**

**Amazon's Execution:** **"So investors need to get it out of their minds that grocery is a bad business. It's not. Groceries in and of themselves, of course, they're low margin, but you can look at them kind of like a Trojan horse for a subscription business, which is super high margin."**

**Quantitative Expansion Metrics:** **"In their last earnings report, there's a whole segment dedicated to retail and grocery selection expansion by 14% quarter over quarter with addition of popular brands. Everyday Essentials nearly doubling growth rate of the rest of the business. Significant expansion and perishable grocery delivery. Now in 1,000 plus cities, targeting 2,300 by the year end."**

The aggressive timeline: **"So by 2025's end, they want to double the amount of over double the amount of places they're in grocery."**

**Macro/Trend Context:**

This trade directly ties to the "AI Productivity Miracle" theme from Section 2, where Amazon benefits from automation-driven margin expansion. It also connects to the "buying what's left for dead" sentiment framework - Amazon hasn't received full recognition despite AWS re-acceleration: **"Right now, I wouldn't say is the most difficult. Amazon stock has finally gotten a little bit of recognition because AWS finally sped back up."**

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The Grocery Margin Concern:**

**The Challenge:** Investors traditionally view grocery as low-margin and therefore unworthy of investment or premium valuations.

**The Response:** Carlson systematically dismantles this objection by pointing to Costco (46 P/E) and Walmart (35 P/E) as proof that grocery businesses command premium multiples when wrapped into subscription models. The logic: **"You can look at them kind of like a Trojan horse for a subscription business, which is super high margin. And that is the exact tactic that, of course, Amazon will do."**

**The Walmart Competition Narrative:**

**The Challenge:** Market narrative suggests Walmart is "invading Amazon's territory" in e-commerce.

**The Response:** Carlson flips the script: **"The grocery business expanding really puts the end to the story of Walmart invading Amazon's territory."** By moving aggressively into grocery (Walmart's stronghold), Amazon goes on offense rather than playing defense.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** Carlson is buying at current levels ($5,000 purchase announced), viewing the combination of AWS re-acceleration and grocery expansion as sufficient catalysts to justify immediate positioning. The entry isn't based on waiting for specific price levels but rather conviction in near-term fundamental inflection points.

**Position Sizing:** The purchase is significant enough to potentially make Amazon his largest position: **"I'll be going over why I'm okay that Amazon's such a large position, why I'm okay with this one potentially even passing up Google to be my biggest position."**

This reveals very high conviction - willing to make Amazon the largest position in the portfolio, surpassing even Google which has been a core holding.

**Risk Controls:** Carlson acknowledges macro risk but separates it from fundamental risk: **"Of course Amazon could sell off if the entire market does that happens but the fundamentals are going to continue upward."**

The risk management philosophy: accept market-driven volatility but maintain conviction in fundamental trajectory.

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

Amazon represents a **quality compounder at inflection** play. The company dominates multiple high-growth verticals (cloud, e-commerce, advertising, streaming), is experiencing near-term positive catalysts (AWS re-acceleration, grocery expansion), and has long-term margin expansion runway through automation. Carlson synthesizes the long-term thesis:

**"As I've said before, I think this company is going to become a company of margin expansion. So, you're going to have long-term revenue growth with their expansion into grocery with their AWS growth, but you're also going to have margins expand."**

**The Automation Margin Story:** **"Amazon is doing layoffs. And while that's sad for the employees being let go, it also means that Amazon's trying to operate more efficiently, increasing their margins by lowering employee expense."**

The scale of opportunity: **"Amazon has 1.5 million employees. They have tens of thousands in the office which AI will help become higher margin. And then you also have more than a million employees in warehouses and as delivery drivers. We know that over time those jobs will be automated to a huge extent."**

**The 5-10 Year Vision:** **"So what I see long-term with this company over the next 5 to 10 years of this continual story of automation and margin improvement and I see very limited downside in the stock with this many catalysts."**

**What This Means:** Amazon offers asymmetric risk-reward with multiple catalysts working simultaneously (AWS growth, grocery expansion, margin improvement) and dominant market positions providing downside protection. This is a core, high-conviction, long-term hold with tactical buying on any market-driven weakness.

## $ADBE - Adobe (DEEP VALUE OPPORTUNITY)

**Main Thesis:** Contrarian value play on a fundamentally sound software business trading at trough multiples (14.5 forward P/E, 7% FCF yield) despite consistent 10-11% revenue growth, 13% performance obligation growth, and 47% YoY free cash flow growth - extreme sentiment disconnect creates double-digit return opportunity with minimal multiple expansion required.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Technical Evidence - Extreme Price Deterioration:**

Carlson establishes the magnitude of the sell-off across multiple timeframes:

**"This is a stock that investors simply want nothing to do with. Just look at some of the numbers of this company, and it shows how poor the sentiment is. First of all, Adobe continues to trade down. It's down 25% year-to-date. So, it's nearly at its all-time low this year. But then we zoom out even further. It's down 34% in the past year. We zoom out over the past 5 years. Adobe is down 50% from its high."**

**Valuation Compression:** **"The multiples this company trades at are one of a dying company. One where it's going downhill. Things look really bad. The returns on this stock are going to be terrible is what investors believe. They priced it at a 14.5 Ford PE ratio. They've priced it at a 7% free cash flow yield. So super high free cash flow yield, super low PE ratio."**

**Fundamental Evidence - Growth Remains Intact:**

The critical observation: sentiment has collapsed but fundamentals have not.

**Consistent Revenue Growth:** **"When we look at the fundamentals of Adobe, does it match the sentiment? When we look at the revenue that continues to grow 10 to 11%. And this company hasn't had any sudden revenue deceleration. So you can't even say, well, the reason the stock is down is because it went from 20% growth to 10. That never happened."**

This is crucial - there was no fundamental break that would justify 50% drawdown. The growth rate has been stable at 10-11%.

**Forward-Looking Strength:** **"The performance obligations, which is basically their backlog of contracts, has grown by 13%. Signifying that there's future growth. It's not just looking at trailing numbers. Now, we're looking at future obligations, and it's still growing."**

**Cash Generation Acceleration:** **"The free cash flow grew 47% year-over-year. There's a bit of bumpiness here. So, on a 5-year average, it's around 14%."**

**Share Buyback Amplification:** **"When we look at the free cash flow per share, it's actually growing a lot faster because Adobe makes so much money that they're buying back a lot of shares."**

**Macro/Trend Context:**

This directly connects to Section 2's "Sentiment-Driven Opportunity Set" theme. Adobe represents the textbook example of extreme negative sentiment creating mispricing: **"This is a stock that investors simply want nothing to do with... ones that the sentiment so negative that investors don't even want to consider it."**

The de-risking wave from speculative growth stocks has created collateral damage in quality software names like Adobe despite no fundamental deterioration.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The AI Disruption Narrative:**

**The Challenge:** Market likely prices in concerns about Adobe's creative software being disrupted by generative AI tools (Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.).

**The Response:** While Carlson doesn't explicitly address this in the transcript, the performance obligation growth (+13%) and revenue stability (10-11% consistent growth) suggest Adobe is successfully navigating AI competition, potentially through its own Firefly AI integration.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** Carlson views current levels as attractive given the valuation compression. No specific price target mentioned for entry - the opportunity exists now at 14.5 forward P/E and 7% FCF yield.

**Price Targets - DCF Framework:** Carlson demonstrates return potential using conservative assumptions:

**"For example, we can say that we think Adobe is going to grow at around 13% earnings per share growth. Let's say that the multiples go up slightly just to a 22 and we have almost a 15% return right there. We get 14.4% returns per year."**

Breaking down the math:
- EPS growth: 13% (slightly above current revenue growth, accounting for buybacks)
- Multiple expansion: from 14.5 to 22 P/E (still below software peer group average)
- Result: 14.4% annual returns

**Alternative Conservative Scenario:** **"If Adobe just continues on doing what it's doing, buying back shares, growing its EPS at even a low rate, 10 to 12%, this stock should have positive returns."**

**Position Sizing:** Not explicitly stated, but categorized as a watchlist/consideration name rather than immediate large purchase like Amazon.

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

Adobe represents a **sentiment-driven value trap that isn't actually a trap** - it has the appearance of a dying business (50% off highs, 14.5 P/E) but the fundamentals of a healthy software compounder (consistent growth, strong FCF, growing backlog). The thesis requires:

1. **No heroic assumptions** - just continuation of current 10-13% growth
2. **Modest multiple normalization** - from 14.5 to 22 P/E (still below historical average)
3. **Time horizon** - willingness to hold through continued negative sentiment

**What This Means:** Adobe offers 14%+ annual return potential with significant margin of safety. The risk/reward is asymmetric because the market has priced in severe deterioration that isn't occurring. Key catalyst: any positive news (earnings beat, AI product success, analyst upgrades) could trigger rapid multiple re-rating given extreme negative positioning.

## $CMG - Chipotle (TURNAROUND SPECULATION)

**Main Thesis:** High-risk, high-reward turnaround speculation on a fundamentally challenged restaurant operator that has undergone massive multiple compression (55 P/E to 27 P/E in one year) due to legitimate operational issues (portion inconsistency, unit volume declines), creating opportunity if management fixes execution or macro conditions improve.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Technical Evidence - Extreme Valuation Compression:**

**Price Decline:** **"Chipotle's had its struggles, I'll admit... But Chipotle is down 50% this year."**

**Multiple Collapse:** **"On the one-year, Chipotle went from a 55 trailing PE ratio now to a 27. The free cash flow yield went from a 1.47% now up to a 3.72%."**

This represents one of the most dramatic multiple compressions in the market - cutting the P/E ratio by more than half in 12 months.

**Fundamental Evidence - Mixed Picture with Legitimate Concerns:**

Carlson is notably balanced in acknowledging real problems:

**Operational Issues:** **"The portion size control, the difference between ordering in person and ordering digital pickup. In many cases, you feel like you get jipped when you go to Chipotle. Lots of people complaining about the making of their burrito. So, they have issues with consistency, with quality."**

**Management Response:** **"They're trying to address that. So far, it seems like they've made some progress, but they haven't fixed that problem."**

**Revenue Deceleration:** **"Some of it is justified. And that's the problem with stock prices going down is there always is some validity to the stock going down. After all, Chipotle's revenue has decelerated. So, you can see that it was going up very quickly. They're raising prices, opening up new locations, unit volume was growing. Things seemed like it was great for Chipotle, but then we've hit a little bit of a slow period."**

**Unit Volume Decline - The Key Metric:**

**"Unit volume is a measurement of every single Chipotle location and how much it's selling every single year. It was at its highest peak 3.21 million. And Chipotle has goals to get this above like 5 million. You know, they want to get it up to six or seven million as top tier restaurants, but it's not there yet. And in fact, instead of continuing on its long-term trend of going upwards, now it's gone down for multiple quarters. We have three quarters in a row of it being below where it was previously."**

This is the smoking gun - same-store sales going backwards for three consecutive quarters indicates real business deterioration, not just sentiment.

**Macro/Trend Context:**

Connects to Section 2's theme about restaurant stocks experiencing "very dramatic swings" in sentiment. Carlson's historical context:

**"I know as someone that has invested in restaurants for a long period of time, I've owned Starbucks before. I've owned Texas Roadhouse. I've owned a number of them before and they've been very profitable investments, but these companies are more volatile. They're ones where investors become very bullish and very bearish very quickly."**

This establishes restaurants as a mean-reverting category where extreme sentiment swings create trading opportunities.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The "Dead Product" Narrative:**

**The Challenge:** Market may believe Chipotle's value proposition is permanently broken and unit volumes will continue declining.

**The Response:** **"Don't be mistaken by the metrics here. Chipotle going down for a few consecutive quarters is not a death blow to the company. This doesn't mean the product's ruined forever. This doesn't mean they can't fix the value proposition or the consistency in their portions."**

Carlson argues this is fixable execution rather than terminal decline.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** Carlson doesn't advocate immediate purchase but rather watchlist status: **"Now, I don't know if Chipotle is the best buy in the world, but it's one that I think investors should have on their watch list."**

This language signals lower conviction than Amazon or even Adobe - it's speculative rather than core.

**Price Targets - DCF Framework:**

**"If we just look at some simple assumptions of a 12% earnings per share growth, a 30 PE ratio, you get a nice healthy 14% return from this company. And these are very moderate assumptions."**

The bull case catalysts: **"Chipotle is a company that could enthuse investors if there's any good news, any sentiment shift. If they open up and start offering breakfasts and that boosts their earnings. If they find a lot of success in new locations, that boosts their earnings. Or if there's a simple economic turnaround and people just go to restaurants more."**

**Position Sizing:** Not specified, but "watchlist" designation suggests small position or no position currently, waiting for catalyst or further weakness.

**Risk Controls:** The key risk management is acknowledging uncertainty: **"I don't know if Chipotle is the best buy in the world."** This honest assessment prevents overconcentration in a speculative turnaround.

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

Chipotle is a **speculative turnaround play with binary outcomes**. Either:

**Bull Case:** Management fixes portion consistency, unit volumes stabilize/reverse, macro improves, stock re-rates from 27 P/E to 35-40 P/E (still below prior peak), generating 50%+ upside.

**Bear Case:** Operational issues persist, unit volumes continue declining, competition intensifies, stock remains rangebound or declines further.

**What This Means:** This is an asymmetric bet structure - the downside is capped given 50% decline and 27 P/E (reasonable for slow-growth restaurant), while upside is substantial if any positive catalyst emerges. Best suited as a small, speculative position for investors comfortable with volatility and willing to monitor operational metrics (unit volume, same-store sales) quarterly for signs of inflection.

## $DUOL - Duolingo (HIGH-CONVICTION SPECULATIVE GROWTH - PORTFOLIO HOLDING)

**Main Thesis:** High-conviction speculative growth holding experiencing temporary de-risking sell-off (down 42% YTD) driven by market-wide rotation out of growth stocks rather than company-specific deterioration, with 27% annual return potential using conservative 20% FCF growth (vs 50% historical) and only 3% terminal FCF yield assumptions.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Technical Evidence - Extreme Sell-Off:**

**Price Deterioration:** **"This is a stock that seemingly nobody wants to own. We look at what's gone on just year-to-date, and Duolingo is down 42% year-to-date. So almost chopped in half. We look at the past one year, it's down 38%. In the past five years, it's well off of its highs. Look at the highs way up here. It was trading at $530 per share. Duolingo is now at 191."**

This represents 64% drawdown from all-time highs - extreme punishment even for growth stocks.

**Fundamental Evidence - Strong Business Performance:**

Carlson doesn't provide specific Duolingo metrics in the transcript, focusing instead on the market pattern analysis. However, the key insight is that fundamentals haven't deteriorated to justify the sell-off.

**Macro/Trend Context - THE CRITICAL INSIGHT:**

This is where Carlson's analysis becomes sophisticated. He systematically demonstrates that Duolingo's sell-off is part of a market-wide de-risking pattern:

**"There is right now a continual sell-off in any company that investors consider even slightly speculative."**

**The Evidence - Comparable Sell-Offs:**

Nuclear: **"We have SMR. This one's down 56% in the past one month. We have Oklo. This is another one that just went through a recent sell-off, down 39% in the past one month. Energy Fuels, another company investors were super bullish on, but in the past month, it's down 36%."**

Quantum Computing: **"We get to the quantum computing category. Remember that one? Investors were really excited about it just a bit ago. Look at it over just the past month, down 53%."**

AI Infrastructure: **"Companies like Coreweave, ones that investors were super bullish on just a month ago. They're now down 43% from their recent highs."**

Consumer Growth: **"Hims and Hers. This is a company that's down 40% in the past month. Oscar Health is another stock that's down 31% in just the past month."**

**The Pattern Recognition:** **"What I see here is any company that doesn't have a wide established moat or super high profitability is being sold off. Anything that seems speculative that traded up with momentum is being sold off."**

**The Application to Duolingo:** **"The market is wanting to derisk. It's wanting to exit speculative growth stocks and Duolingo today is treated and bucketed in the category as a speculative growth stock."**

**The Fundamental Distinction:** **"There's lots of people that believe this stock is no different than Candy Crush or Clash Royale. Simple mobile game that's a little bit addictive and it will go through its wave of growth and inevitable failure when the hype wears off. And then there's the core believers that believe it's a new category of core education and digital expansion across the globe. But right now it is speculative. The story is not told. The fundamentals are not established enough. The moat isn't known enough today."**

**The Key Insight - Trading Patterns vs Fundamentals:**

**"And so I believe that part of the reason that Duolingo is selling off with such aggressiveness is simply because of the de-risking nature of the overall market. You can look at many similar companies that are in that speculative growth stock bucket and they'll have very similar stock patterns, very similar trading patterns over the past year. In fact, many of them went down almost the exact same time periods."**

This is sophisticated market analysis - Carlson is identifying beta exposure to growth stock sentiment rather than alpha-specific company deterioration.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The "Mobile Game Fad" Narrative:**

**The Challenge:** **"There's lots of people that believe this stock is no different than Candy Crush or Clash Royale. Simple mobile game that's a little bit addictive and it will go through its wave of growth and inevitable failure when the hype wears off."**

**The Response:** Carlson acknowledges this is unresolved: **"But right now it is speculative. The story is not told."** However, his continued holding and high return expectations signal he believes in the "core education and digital expansion" thesis rather than the "mobile game fad" thesis.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** Carlson is already positioned (it's a portfolio holding), but the sell-off creates opportunity for adding: **"This is another stock that's been beaten down this year is one of my own, which is Duolingo."**

**Price Targets - DCF Framework with Conservative Assumptions:**

**"I don't need to put in super aggressive assumptions to make this stock have a decent return. If I use the free cash flow for this DCF and I say that it's going to grow its free cash flow at 20% per year, you may say that that's a bit high, but remember Duolingo has grown its free cash flow at 50% per year. So, I'm pricing in massive deceleration in its growth."**

The math:
- Historical FCF growth: 50% per year
- Modeled FCF growth: 20% per year (60% deceleration)
- Terminal FCF yield: 3%
- **Result: 27% annual returns**

**"With that deceleration priced in and only trading at a 3% free cash flow yield, the stock gives a staggering 27% return."**

**Position Sizing:** Significant enough to mention as "one of my own" holdings, indicating meaningful portfolio weight.

**Risk Controls:** The primary risk management is psychological - maintaining conviction during drawdown. Carlson's framework: **"Even though there are reasons that you could point to for Duolingo specifically, I believe a large part of the sell-off is simple trading patterns and I believe when investors have a greater appetite for risk, we'll see something different with this company."**

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

Duolingo represents a **high-conviction bet on the market misclassifying a secular growth business as a speculative fad**. The thesis requires:

1. **Belief in the category** - that language learning/education apps are secular growth, not mobile game fads
2. **Patience through volatility** - willingness to endure growth stock beta during de-risking periods
3. **Faith in execution** - that management continues delivering 20%+ FCF growth over multi-year periods

**What This Means:** This is Carlson's highest-risk, highest-reward position in the portfolio. The 27% return potential reflects the extreme risk premium markets demand for speculative growth. The investment works if:

- Duolingo proves it's a platform business with network effects, not a fad
- Growth stock sentiment normalizes, driving multiple expansion
- The company continues high FCF growth execution

The position is vulnerable to:
- Continued growth stock de-rating
- Any fundamental stumble (user growth slowdown, monetization challenges)
- Competitive threats from established education platforms

This is a "own with conviction or don't own at all" position - the volatility demands strong hands.

## $DASH - DoorDash (PLATFORM PLAY WITH AV INSULATION)

**Main Thesis:** High-quality platform business with 25% revenue growth, 20% FCF growth, and $1B advertising run rate, trading at attractive valuation (3% FCF yield) after 25% one-month decline, with strategic advantage of being more insulated from autonomous vehicle disruption than Uber due to food delivery focus and ability to partner with AV providers.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Technical Evidence - Recent Pullback Creates Entry:**

**Price Performance:** **"This is another stock that I've had on my watch list for some time. Year-to-date, it's up 22%, but in the past month, it's down 25%."**

**Fundamental Evidence - Strong Growth Metrics:**

**Revenue Growth:** **"When we look at the company, the fundamentals show a very strong company. Revenue growing 25%."**

**Order Volume:** **"The orders on a trailing 12-month basis, growing to 19.5%, almost 3 billion orders."**

**Cash Generation:** **"Their free cash flow is growing at 20% per year."**

**Profitability Inflection:** **"The earnings per share have gone from the red up into the green."**

**Advertising Business:** **"The ad segment of Door Dash has grown to a billion dollar run rate. So, they have a huge ad business built into this one as well. Restaurants want to advertise and kind of list sponsored links similar to Amazon.com and those show up above the other results around you. That ad space is highly profitable for Door Dash."**

**Strategic Evidence - AV Disruption Analysis:**

This is the most sophisticated part of Carlson's DoorDash thesis - the comparative analysis with Uber on autonomous vehicle risk:

**Uber's AV Exposure:** **"Now, investors already know how good of a company Uber is, and Uber is very similar to Door Dash. Both of them operate and compete in food delivery and grocery delivery, but Uber also has a lot of exposure to drives. In fact, just getting rides and passenger rides is the biggest part of their business. So, Uber is like a primarily ride sharing business with a little side business as Uber Eats."**

**DoorDash's Focused Model:** **"And Door Dash is simply a delivery business. All they do is they deliver food, they deliver groceries, they even deliver stuff from convenience stores. If you want something picked up fast, you don't want to go out and get it, you can get it on Door Dash."**

**The Key Strategic Insight:** **"One of the key distinctions is Door Dash seems more insulated against autonomous vehicles than Uber. Uber has to compete with Waymo in these dynamics of Tesla. Tesla has shown zero interest in partnering with Uber. Tesla eventually figures out how to offer robo taxi without a driver, that could pose a problem for Uber."**

**DoorDash's Partnership Advantage:** **"Then you have other companies, some of which are wanting to partner with Uber, some aren't. But that's a highly competitive business. It's becoming more saturated by the day. And this creates an interesting dynamic because although Door Dash seems like it's less diversified, they're also not competing as directly with autonomous vehicles."**

**The Food Delivery AV Dynamic:** **"It is true that AVs will do food delivery, but there is no quick second place. Waymo doesn't have some big food delivery business. In fact, whenever they want to do that, they have to partner with Door Dash. So, Door Dash in some ways may actually be more insulated from technological advancement than Uber."**

This is counterintuitive insight - the less diversified company (DoorDash) has better structural positioning against technological disruption than the more diversified one (Uber) because DoorDash can partner with AV providers rather than compete with them.

**Technology Positioning:** **"And Door Dash is investing aggressively into autonomous vehicles and other robotic type of delivery services. They want to own that technology, not abandon it."**

**Macro/Trend Context:**

Connects to the de-risking theme from Section 2, as DoorDash has pulled back 25% in the recent growth stock sell-off despite strong fundamentals.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The AV Disruption Threat:**

**The Challenge:** Autonomous vehicles will eliminate delivery drivers, threatening DoorDash's business model.

**The Response:** Carlson reframes this as opportunity rather than threat: DoorDash can partner with AV providers (unlike Uber which competes directly with them), and is "investing aggressively into autonomous vehicles and other robotic type of delivery services."

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** The 25% one-month pullback creates the entry opportunity on a watchlist name. Current levels appear attractive given growth profile and FCF yield.

**Price Targets - DCF Framework:**

**"With Door Dash, we again don't need to make too aggressive of assumptions. Even with a 15% free cash flow per share growth rate, which has been much higher historically, a 3% free cash flow yield, we get above a 10% return."**

The conservative nature of assumptions:
- 15% FCF growth (below current 20% actual growth)
- 3% terminal FCF yield
- Result: 10%+ annual returns

**Upside Optionality:** **"And that gives you access to a company that has much higher potential upside if things end up going better than expected, which for these type of companies that are large platform businesses, they have ample ways to grow."**

**Position Sizing:** Watchlist status suggests not currently owned but under consideration for initiation.

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

DoorDash represents a **high-quality platform compounder with structural moat** trading at reasonable valuation after temporary sell-off. The thesis layers multiple elements:

1. **Strong fundamental execution** - 25% revenue growth, 20% FCF growth, advertising monetization
2. **Platform economics** - approaching 3 billion orders annually with improving take rates
3. **Structural AV advantage** - more insulated than Uber due to partnership vs. competition dynamic
4. **Conservative valuation** - 10%+ returns with 15% growth assumptions (below current run rate)

**What This Means:** DoorDash offers double-digit returns with multiple expansion optionality if the market re-rates platform businesses higher. The AV thesis provides differentiation vs. Uber - DoorDash can be an AV partner rather than competitor, reducing disruption risk. The advertising business provides high-margin revenue stream similar to Amazon's model. Entry after 25% pullback provides margin of safety. Suitable as core platform holding with 3-5 year time horizon.

## $MELI - MercadoLibre (EMERGING MARKET GROWTH MONSTER)

**Main Thesis:** Exceptional growth compounder with record-setting 27 consecutive quarters of 30%+ YoY revenue growth, operating in underpenetrated South American markets with Amazon-like playbook (broad selection, low prices, advertising monetization) plus fintech integration (MercadoPago), though requires careful valuation analysis due to customer deposit accounting distortions.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):**

**Fundamental Evidence - Unprecedented Growth Record:**

**The Growth Achievement:** **"When I looked at some of the fundamentals of Marcato Libre, I was pretty shocked by how good this stock is... This stock is a growth behemoth. In fact, I believe Marcato Libre holds some type of record. I was told about this. I had to look it up. By delivering over 30% year-over-year revenue growth for 27 consecutive quarters as of Q3 of 2025."**

**The Historical Uniqueness:** **"This sustained performance is unique. As its chief financial officer noted, no other company in the world has delivered this for such a long period of time. It's the only company to ever do this 30% year-over-year growth rate for 27 consecutive quarters. So, it's just phenomenal what this company has accomplished."**

**Scale and Engagement:** **"Marcato Libre boasts an extensive user base with 68 million monthly active users and rapidly increasing engagement across both commerce and fintech services."**

**Strategic Evidence - Amazon Playbook in Underpenetrated Markets:**

**Geographic Opportunity:** **"Marcato Libre operates in South America and these are areas with developing economies. They don't have giant companies like Amazon that's already established themselves. So, there's lots of white space to grow into."**

**The Amazon Playbook:** **"The platform claims to have the broadest assortment in Brazil. A recent seller-friendly initiatives such as lowering take rates and shipping thresholds have successfully attracted new merchants and expanded live listings in low ASP segments. Now that's a line taken straight from Amazon having the broadest selection. Amazon always believes that people want fast shipping, low prices, and broad selection. That's exactly the playbook that Marcato Libre is following."**

**Advertising Monetization:** **"But more importantly, I believe is their advertising segment. Similar to Amazon again, they're building out this fast growing retail business. Huge selection, low prices, and then putting an advertising business on top of that. Advertising revenue surged by 38% year-over-year with significant momentum in off-platform and video formats."**

**Fintech Integration:** **"What I understand is that Marcato Pago is their fintech portion. So this is a company that's growing in retail and they've leveraged that into fintech."**

**Valuation Evidence - Accounting Complexity:**

This is where Carlson provides crucial nuance:

**The Surface Metrics:** **"For example, on the PE ratio, Marcato Libre looks like it's a premium price company, a 37 Ford PE. That's in the higher end. But then in the free cash flow, it's at a 7.7% yield, which makes it seem like it's super cheap."**

**The Distortion:** **"We can see this distinction again comparing the free cash flow per share to the earnings per share. The free cash flow per share looks like this. In the trailing 12 months, it was $187. The earnings per share in the trailing 12 months was $40."**

**The Explanation:** **"Now, free cash flow per share and earnings per share are never the same... Typically, the free cash flow per share will be a little bit higher than the earnings per share, but to a marginal extent, maybe 30, maybe 40% more. It's typically not four or five times as much. So, why is Marcato Libre so much higher in their free cash flow than their earnings per share?"**

**The Customer Deposit Issue:** **"That is because they take on customer deposits. So, they get that cash in today, but they don't really own that money. They're just holding that cash flow for their customers."**

**The Adjusted Valuation:** **"So, when you map out the free cash flow per share and you adjust it for the amount of money that they're taking in in deposits, the free cash flow per share drops dramatically. It's a lot closer to around 3.2%. Now, that's not a bad yield. It's actually good for a company like Marcato Libre, but it's not nearly as cheap as a 7.7% yield."**

This valuation analysis demonstrates Carlson's analytical rigor - he identifies the accounting distortion and adjusts for it rather than taking headline metrics at face value.

**Macro/Trend Context:**

MercadoLibre benefits from secular trends in emerging market e-commerce penetration and digital payments adoption. The company is simultaneously Amazon (e-commerce) and PayPal (MercadoPago) for Latin America.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:**

**The Emerging Market Risk:**

**The Challenge:** Operating in South American markets exposes the company to currency volatility, political instability, and regulatory risk.

**The Response:** While Carlson doesn't explicitly address this, the 27-quarter growth record demonstrates the company has successfully navigated these risks. The diversification across multiple South American countries provides some hedge against single-country risk.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):**

**Entry Criteria:** Carlson positions this as a research candidate rather than immediate buy: **"In any case, this is a company that I believe is worth looking on. It's one that I'm going to be doing more research on and considering for the future."**

**Price Targets:** Not explicitly provided via DCF, but the growth sustainability provides the return framework: **"As long as they can sustain any level of this growth for the continued future, I don't see how the stock can go down."**

**Position Sizing:** No position currently; in research phase. The emerging market exposure and accounting complexity warrant careful due diligence before sizing.

**Risk Controls:** The primary risk control is the research-first approach - Carlson acknowledges needing to understand the business better before committing capital.

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**

MercadoLibre represents a **secular growth monster in underpenetrated markets** with Amazon-like e-commerce dominance plus fintech integration. The thesis requires:

1. **Belief in emerging market growth** - that South American e-commerce/fintech penetration continues expanding
2. **Trust in execution** - that management maintains 25-30%+ growth rates
3. **Comfort with complexity** - understanding accounting nuances (customer deposits) and emerging market risks
4. **Valuation discipline** - using adjusted FCF metrics rather than headline numbers

**What This Means:** MELI offers rare combination of growth (30%+ revenue growth for 27 quarters) and scale (68M MAU) in large, underpenetrated markets. The dual business model (commerce + fintech) provides multiple revenue streams and network effects. The advertising monetization layer adds high-margin revenue similar to Amazon's playbook.

However, the investment requires:
- Acceptance of emerging market volatility
- Understanding of customer deposit accounting distortions
- Comfort with premium valuation (37 P/E, 3.2% adjusted FCF yield)
- Longer research/due diligence timeline

Suitable as growth allocation for investors with multi-year time horizons and comfort with emerging market exposure. The 27-quarter growth record provides confidence in execution, but position sizing should reflect geographic and accounting complexity.
