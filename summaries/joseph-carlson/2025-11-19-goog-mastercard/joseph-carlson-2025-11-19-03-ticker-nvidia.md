## Trade Thesis: Nvidia - No Position / Structural Concerns Trump Near-Term Execution

**Main Thesis:**

Neutral to bearish-leaning from a structural perspective; explicitly avoiding position despite acknowledging strong near-term execution. Carlson does not hold Nvidia and articulates specific reasons why he prefers to avoid the stock despite recognizing it will likely beat upcoming earnings. The core thesis is NOT that Nvidia is failing or poorly managed—quite the opposite. Rather, the concern is that Nvidia faces a unique structural vulnerability where its largest customers (representing 40% of revenue) are simultaneously its biggest competitive threats, all actively developing proprietary chip solutions to reduce dependence on Nvidia. This creates an unfavorable long-term risk profile despite strong current fundamentals. The investment conclusion: **"I believe the cloud companies themselves are better risk-adjusted bets."** This is about relative positioning, not absolute negativity on Nvidia's business.

**Position Details:**
- **Current Position:** $0 (explicitly not invested)
- **Strategy Type:** Avoidance based on structural risk assessment, not near-term trading call
- **Preference:** Long the customers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta) rather than the supplier (Nvidia)

### Supporting Evidence (The "Why")

#### Technical Evidence:

Carlson doesn't provide technical chart analysis for Nvidia, but he does acknowledge the near-term technical setup is likely bullish given earnings expectations and market positioning:

**"I believe this quarter Nvidia is going to be fine."**

The market context: **"Nvidia is posting their earnings"** and there's widespread anticipation. The technical implication is that Nvidia likely rallies on strong results (as it typically does), but this doesn't change Carlson's structural concerns.

The broader technical observation relates to market dependency: analysts are saying **"this is a so goes Nvidia, so goes the market kind of report."** This codependency creates additional risk—if Nvidia disappoints, it doesn't just hurt Nvidia holders; it impacts the entire market, particularly the Mag 7 stocks that have driven indices higher.

#### Fundamental Evidence:

**1. Customer Concentration Risk**

The core structural concern: **"One of them is that Nvidia is a company where its own customers, like it noted here, 40% of its revenue comes from only four different companies."**

Carlson references the data: **"Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, which taken together represent more than 40% of Nvidia's sales, are projected to increase their combined AI spending by 34% over the next 12 months to $440 billion."**

Customer concentration in itself isn't necessarily fatal—many successful companies have concentrated customer bases. The problem is what those customers are doing: **"Those companies are trying to mitigate Nvidia's impact. They're trying to essentially replace Nvidia."**

**2. Active Customer Vertical Integration**

Specific examples of customer defection efforts:

**"Google's doing it with its TPUs."** - Google has developed and deployed proprietary Tensor Processing Units for AI training and inference, reducing reliance on Nvidia GPUs for many workloads.

**"We have Amazon doing it with its tranium."** - Amazon Web Services has developed proprietary AI chips (Trainium for training, Inferentia for inference) to offer customers alternatives to Nvidia-powered instances.

**"All of them internally are trying to develop their own chipset to train and do different things that Nvidia previously has done."** - This isn't theoretical R&D; these are active product development programs with significant capital allocation and engineering resources.

**3. The Unfavorable Supplier-Customer Dynamic**

Carlson articulates why this dynamic is problematic: **"But I don't love the dynamic where your own customers are actively trying to replace you."**

This is fundamentally different from normal competitive threats. Typical competition: other suppliers offering better products/prices. Nvidia's situation: customers themselves becoming competitors because: (a) Nvidia's margins are high enough to justify customer vertical integration, (b) customers have the technical capability and capital to build alternatives, (c) strategic dependence on a single supplier creates risk customers want to mitigate.

**4. The ASML Analogy - What Healthy Supplier Relationships Look Like**

Carlson provides a powerful thought experiment to illustrate the concern:

**"It's a bit like if we looked at ASML and every single customer of ASML was actively working on building their own lithography machine. They were developing it. They were putting huge infrastructure into it and they're eventually going to build their own lithography machine. Well, it's a bit like what these customers are doing with Nvidia."**

Why this analogy matters: ASML is often cited as having one of the strongest moats in technology due to the impossibility of customers replicating extreme ultraviolet lithography. Carlson is saying: imagine if that moat didn't exist and every customer was building their own EUV machines. That would fundamentally change ASML's investment case. That hypothetical for ASML is the reality for Nvidia.

**5. Proven Customer Success in Alternatives**

This isn't speculative—customers are already succeeding: **"Google's TPUs are highly effective. They've already shown with their Gemini 3 that they can train the best models with their TPUs. This is also a big selling point."**

The significance: Google trained Gemini 3.0 (a frontier model competitive with GPT-4 and Claude) primarily on TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. This demonstrates that at least one customer has achieved technical parity for the most demanding workload (training large language models). If one customer can do it, others can follow.

The market implication: Google can now pitch GCP customers on TPU-powered AI services as an alternative to Nvidia GPU instances, creating competitive pressure in the cloud AI market.

**6. Analyst Concerns About Escalating Expectations**

Referenced analyst commentary: **"Analysts saying that they're concerned that these companies are continually raising investors expectations. They're raising the bar. They have to feed the market with rising expectations and it is a dangerous game for public companies to play."**

The metaphor: **"It's like the antie is always getting upped and up. It's like you're doubling down on your bets in Vegas and eventually it's not going to pan out."**

Carlson's counter to this specific concern: **"Now, I actually disagree with this. I think that Nvidia is not just trying to up the Annie, but they're fulfilling on demand. And right now there's such an insatiable demand for artificial intelligence, for all this processing and the efficiency that can happen from it that it's a real product with real demand."**

So Carlson acknowledges the concern but believes near-term demand is genuine, not hype-driven. The disconnect: short-term demand is real (supporting current valuation and earnings), but long-term structural position is vulnerable (justifying avoiding the stock).

#### Macro/Trend Context:

This avoidance connects to Theme 3 from Market-Wide Analysis: **"The Structural Vulnerability Thesis"** - customer concentration and strategic risk in supplier relationships.

The macro context is the AI infrastructure buildout, which creates a short-term tailwind for Nvidia (massive capex from hyperscalers) but also creates the resources and motivation for those same customers to develop alternatives. The very success that's driving Nvidia's current growth is funding the competitive threats to its future growth.

The broader trend: vertical integration in technology. When software/cloud companies reach sufficient scale, they often backward-integrate into hardware to: (1) reduce costs, (2) customize for workloads, (3) reduce strategic dependence, (4) capture more value chain margin. Examples: Apple (custom chips), Amazon (Graviton CPUs, Trainium/Inferentia), Google (TPUs), Microsoft (reportedly developing custom AI chips).

Nvidia's position is that of a high-margin supplier to customers who: (a) have the technical sophistication to build alternatives, (b) have the capital to fund development, (c) have the scale to justify the investment, and (d) have strategic motivation to reduce dependence. This is not a sustainable long-term dynamic.

#### Key Data Points:

- **Customer Concentration:** 40% of revenue from four companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta)
- **Customer AI Spending:** $440 billion projected over next 12 months (34% increase)
- **Competitor Products:** Google TPUs (proven effective for frontier model training), Amazon Trainium/Inferentia, Microsoft custom chips (in development), Meta custom chips (in development)
- **Near-Term Expectation:** "Nvidia is going to be fine this quarter"
- **Carlson's Position:** $0 (not invested despite acknowledging strong execution)

### Counter-Arguments Addressed

**The Challenge - "But Nvidia is Executing Perfectly and Demand is Strong":**

The bull case: Nvidia is beating estimates, growing 50%+, has a dominant market position, and demand far exceeds supply. Why avoid a company with such strong fundamentals?

**The Response:**

Carlson explicitly addresses this: **"I believe this quarter Nvidia is going to be fine. The reason that I choose not to invest in it is because I have some persistent concerns about this company."**

The distinction is crucial: near-term execution excellence does NOT override long-term structural concerns. A company can be growing rapidly and still be a poor long-term investment if the trajectory is unsustainable.

On the demand argument: **"I think that Nvidia is not just trying to up the Annie, but they're fulfilling on demand. And right now there's such an insatiable demand for artificial intelligence, for all this processing and the efficiency that can happen from it that it's a real product with real demand. This isn't something that's hyped up that they're trying to just build momentum. They're trying to describe how excited they are about a real phenomenon going on."**

So Carlson agrees demand is real and current execution is strong. But that doesn't change the structural concern about customer defection over multi-year horizons.

**The Challenge - "Nvidia Has a Moat in Software (CUDA) and Ecosystem":**

A common bull argument: even if customers develop hardware alternatives, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem and developer familiarity create lock-in that's difficult to overcome.

**The Response:**

While not explicitly addressed in this episode, the Google TPU success story partially refutes this: **"Google's TPUs are highly effective. They've already shown with their Gemini 3 that they can train the best models with their TPUs."**

If Google can train frontier models on non-Nvidia hardware, the CUDA moat is less formidable than bulls claim. Additionally, frameworks like PyTorch and JAX are increasingly hardware-agnostic, reducing CUDA's lock-in power over time.

**The Challenge - "The ASML Comparison Doesn't Hold - Nvidia's Position is Defensible":**

One might argue the ASML analogy is flawed because lithography is far more complex than AI chip design, and Nvidia's advantage is more defensible than Carlson suggests.

**The Response:**

The analogy isn't about technical complexity parity—it's about supplier-customer dynamics. The point is: imagine if ASML's customers were all trying to replace ASML. That would fundamentally change the investment case regardless of ASML's current moat. The fact that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are ALL pursuing alternatives suggests the moat is breachable in ways ASML's is not.

Additionally, the existence proof matters: **Google already succeeded.** If customers can achieve technical parity with sufficient investment, and they have both the resources and motivation to make that investment, then it's reasonable to expect continued share loss over time.

**The Challenge - "You're Missing Massive Returns in the Best-Performing Stock":**

The opportunity cost argument: Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market. By avoiding it on structural concerns, you're missing substantial returns while those concerns may take years to materialize (if ever).

**The Response:**

Carlson's framework addresses this through relative positioning: **"I believe the cloud companies themselves are better risk-adjusted bets."**

This is key: he's not saying Nvidia will crash or that holders should sell. He's saying the risk-adjusted returns of owning the customers (who benefit from AI without the structural vulnerability) are superior to owning the supplier (who has the vulnerability).

If you own Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, you capture AI upside regardless of whether Nvidia maintains dominance or customers successfully shift to proprietary chips. If you own Nvidia, you're making a specific bet that customer defection won't materially impact the business. Carlson believes the former is better risk-adjusted positioning.

### Risk Management & Execution (The "How")

#### Entry Criteria:

N/A - Carlson explicitly does not have a position and is not looking to enter.

The implicit entry criteria that would change this view: if customers abandoned vertical integration efforts and recommitted to Nvidia as primary supplier, or if Nvidia developed new products/services that created different types of lock-in beyond GPU sales, the thesis might change.

#### Price Targets:

N/A - No position, no price targets.

However, Carlson's avoidance suggests implicit valuation view: even if Nvidia drops 20-30% on some catalyst, the structural concern remains. This isn't "Nvidia is overvalued, would buy on a dip"—it's "structural position is unfavorable regardless of valuation."

#### Risk Controls:

The risk control is portfolio construction: **avoid the position entirely** rather than trying to time entry/exit or size small.

This reflects a philosophical approach: when structural concerns are identified, the best risk management is avoidance, not position sizing or hedging. Trying to trade around structural deterioration is difficult; easier to simply allocate capital to better risk-adjusted opportunities.

#### Position Sizing:

**Current Position:** $0

**Alternative Positioning:** 
Instead of Nvidia exposure, Carlson holds:
- **Google:** $175,000 (benefits from TPU strategy, avoids Nvidia dependency risk)
- Presumably positions in other cloud companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Meta not detailed in this episode but referenced as preferred positioning)

This is expressing a view: I want AI exposure, but I want it through the customers/platforms who benefit regardless of chip supplier, not through the chip supplier who faces customer defection risk.

### The Complete Trade Thesis

**Synthesis:**

Nvidia represents a case study in distinguishing between **current execution excellence** and **long-term structural positioning**. The company is unquestionably executing well, growing rapidly, and meeting massive demand. None of that is in dispute. The investment question is: does current excellence justify investment given long-term structural vulnerabilities?

Carlson's conclusion: No. The specific concern isn't Nvidia's technology, management, or current competitive position. The concern is the unique dynamic where the company's four largest customers (40% of revenue) are all actively working to reduce their dependence on Nvidia by developing proprietary alternatives.

This is different from typical competitive threats:
- Not new entrants (AMD, Intel) trying to build better GPUs
- Not Chinese competitors trying to replicate Nvidia's technology  
- Not regulatory risks or export controls (though those exist separately)
- Rather: **your own customers deciding you're too important/expensive and they need alternatives**

The incentive structure is unfavorable:
- Nvidia's high margins motivate customer vertical integration (margins high enough to justify development costs)
- Nvidia's importance creates strategic risk customers want to mitigate (too dependent on single supplier)
- Customers have the capability (world-class engineering teams) and capital ($440B AI spending) to build alternatives
- Early success exists (Google's TPUs proven effective for frontier models)

The time horizon mismatch:
- Short-term (1-2 years): Demand exceeds supply, growth continues, earnings beat expectations
- Medium-term (3-5 years): Customer alternatives gain traction, market share erosion begins, growth decelerates
- Long-term (5+ years): Nvidia becomes one of several suppliers rather than dominant provider, margins compress, multiple contracts

The relative positioning argument:
- If you own Nvidia: you benefit only if Nvidia maintains dominance
- If you own Google/Microsoft/Amazon/Meta: you benefit from AI regardless of chip supplier dynamics
- Therefore: cloud companies are better risk-adjusted AI exposure

**What This Means - Risk/Reward Profile:**

This isn't a traditional trade thesis because there's no position. Instead, it's an **opportunity cost framework**: is capital better deployed in Nvidia or alternatives?

**Nvidia Bull Case (Carlson's acknowledgment of the counter-thesis):**
- Near-term demand remains strong
- CUDA ecosystem provides software lock-in
- Customer alternatives prove ineffective or uneconomical  
- Nvidia maintains technological lead through innovation
- Data center AI spending continues to grow, providing room for multiple suppliers
- Stock continues to perform well for 2-3 more years

**Nvidia Bear Case (Carlson's concern):**
- Customer alternatives achieve parity (Google already has)
- 40% revenue concentration begins to erode as customers shift workloads
- Margin pressure emerges as customers negotiate harder with credible alternatives
- Market realizes structural vulnerability, multiple contracts from 40-50x to 25-30x
- Stock significantly underperforms cloud companies over 3-5 years

**Carlson's Assessment:**
The bull case may play out short-term, but the bear case is more likely long-term. Rather than trying to time the transition, better to simply own the companies with superior structural positioning (the customers).

**Risk/Reward vs. Alternatives:**
- **Nvidia:** High potential returns if dominance continues, significant risk if customer defection accelerates
- **Cloud Companies (Google, etc.):** More moderate returns, but structural advantages (diversified revenue, own alternative chips, benefit from AI regardless of supplier dynamics)

The conclusion: **"I see this as just one long-term concern about Nvidia. I believe the cloud companies themselves are better risk-adjusted bets."**

**Strategic Significance:**

This avoidance represents a sophisticated framework: distinguishing between a good company and a good investment. Nvidia is unquestionably a good company with excellent management and products. But that doesn't make it a good investment if:
1. The positive factors are already priced in (high valuation)
2. Structural vulnerabilities exist that aren't priced in (customer concentration + customer vertical integration)
3. Alternative investments offer similar upside with better risk profiles (cloud companies)

The lesson: **investment decisions should be based on forward-looking structural positioning, not backward-looking execution history**. Nvidia's past performance has been exceptional, but forward-looking structure is concerning. Therefore, avoid.

This also demonstrates portfolio construction philosophy: when you identify structural concerns, the best risk management is often avoidance and reallocation to better risk-adjusted opportunities, not trying to trade around the deterioration with clever timing or sizing.

**Conviction Level:**

High conviction on avoidance, demonstrated by:
- **Explicit zero position** despite Nvidia being one of market's best performers
- **Specific articulation of structural concerns** (not vague skepticism)
- **Alternative positioning** (owns the customers instead)
- **Acknowledgment of near-term strength** while maintaining avoidance (disciplined framework, not reactive to price action)

The stance: **"The reason that I choose not to invest in it is because I have some persistent concerns about this company."** This is deliberate avoidance based on analytical concerns, not ignorance or oversight. Carlson has clearly evaluated Nvidia and decided the risk/reward doesn't justify a position given available alternatives.

The broader message: not every good company belongs in your portfolio. Capital allocation is about relative attractiveness, and sometimes the best decision is avoiding a strong company because better opportunities exist elsewhere.
