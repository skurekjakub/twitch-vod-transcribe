## Section 4: Minor Mentions & Glossary

---

### Minor Tickers Mentioned

**$GOOGL - Google/Alphabet**
Brief reference as Carlson's current largest position that Amazon may surpass. Used as case study example of sentiment reversal: was considered "disrupted by ChatGPT" 6 months ago with walls "caving in," now up 80% in 6 months and viewed as potentially better than Microsoft with strong YouTube, Cloud, and subscription business growth.

**$MSFT - Microsoft**
Mentioned in comparison to Google, with recent narrative shift suggesting Google could become "a bigger company than Microsoft" due to growing subscription business and strong cloud/YouTube performance.

**$NFLX - Netflix**
Primary context: Carlson's portfolio holding and historical case study. Used to illustrate the importance of holding through difficult periods when Bill Ackman sold due to uncertainty. Also discussed regarding new gaming initiatives (Party Games using phone as controller, licensing Red Dead Redemption 2 for mobile). Noted as #2 in global streaming behind only itself.

**$COST - Costco**
Used as proof-of-concept for Amazon's grocery strategy. Trades at 46 forward P/E despite being "grocery company" because it wraps low-margin groceries into high-margin subscription model with "unyielding customer loyalty" and "high returns on capital employed." Demonstrates that grocery businesses can command premium valuations.

**$WMT - Walmart**
Cited alongside Costco as grocery business trading at premium multiple (35 forward P/E). Used in context of Amazon's grocery expansion "putting the end to the story of Walmart invading Amazon's territory" - suggests Amazon going on offense rather than defense.

**$UBER - Uber**
Compared extensively with DoorDash. Characterized as "primarily ride sharing business with a little side business as Uber Eats," more exposed to autonomous vehicle disruption than DoorDash because Tesla "has shown zero interest in partnering with Uber" and Waymo/others may compete directly in ride-sharing.

**$ORCL - Oracle**
Example of speculative growth stock giving back gains: "had that massive spike after the deal with OpenAI only to trade down 26% in the past 1 month. The stock has given up basically all of the gains it made from that announcement."

**$SMR - SMR (Nuclear/Uranium)**
Example of extreme speculative sell-off: down 56% in past one month, illustrating the de-risking wave across growth stocks.

**$OKLO - Oklo (Nuclear)**
Part of nuclear sector collapse during de-risking: down 39% in past one month.

**Energy Fuels (ticker not specified)**
Another nuclear/uranium name down 36% in past month, showing sector-wide de-risking rather than company-specific issues.

**Quantum Computing Stock (specific ticker not mentioned)**
Generic reference to quantum computing category: "Remember that one? Investors were really excited about it just a bit ago. Look at it over just the past month, down 53%." Illustrates how quickly sentiment shifts in speculative sectors.

**CoreWeave (ticker not specified - may be private)**
AI infrastructure company example: "ones that investors were super bullish on just a month ago. They're now down 43% from their recent highs."

**$HIMS - Hims & Hers**
Consumer health company used as example of speculative growth sell-off: down 40% in past month despite no fundamental deterioration mentioned.

**Oscar Health (ticker: $OSCR)**
Health insurance company down 31% in past month, part of consumer-led growth stock sell-off pattern.

**$SBUX - Starbucks**
Historical holding mentioned as example of Carlson's restaurant investment experience: "I've owned Starbucks before. I've owned Texas Roadhouse." Used to establish credibility on restaurant sector volatility and sentiment swings.

**Texas Roadhouse (ticker: $TXRH)**
Another historical restaurant holding demonstrating Carlson's profitable experience in the sector despite high volatility.

**$BRK - Berkshire Hathaway (implied via Bill Ackman reference)**
Indirect reference through Bill Ackman selling Netflix when "very uncertain and unsure about the future," used as example of even sophisticated investors capitulating at wrong times.

**$TSLA - Tesla**
Mentioned in context of autonomous vehicle competition with Uber: "Tesla has shown zero interest in partnering with Uber. Tesla eventually figures out how to offer robo taxi without a driver, that could pose a problem for Uber."

**Waymo (Alphabet subsidiary)**
Autonomous vehicle company mentioned as Uber competitor and potential DoorDash partner: "Waymo doesn't have some big food delivery business. In fact, whenever they want to do that, they have to partner with Door Dash."

### Minor Strategies/Concepts Mentioned

**S&P 500 Outperformance Strategy**
Carlson's Story Fund portfolio was created "to demonstrate that you could outperform the S&P 500 and the QQQ. Spoiler alert, it outperformed the S&P 500 and the QQQ by a pretty wide margin. Every year, it's gone up substantially for the past three years, far outperforming the market."

**Buying the Dip During 2022 Sell-Off**
Reference to portfolio strategy during 2022 market decline: "It did dip down a lot in 2022 because all these companies had a sell-off, but doubling down on these companies at the lows, buying more Netflix really bumped up the performance."

**Performance Obligations (Deferred Revenue)**
Mentioned for Adobe as forward-looking indicator: "basically their backlog of contracts, has grown by 13%. Signifying that there's future growth." Used to distinguish between trailing metrics and future commitments.

**Free Cash Flow Per Share vs. EPS**
Discussed extensively for Adobe and MercadoLibre. For MELI, used to explain customer deposit accounting: "Typically, the free cash flow per share will be a little bit higher than the earnings per share, but to a marginal extent, maybe 30, maybe 40% more. It's typically not four or five times as much."

**Unit Volume (Restaurant Metric)**
Key operational metric for Chipotle: "a measurement of every single Chipotle location and how much it's selling every single year." Used to assess same-store sales health, with three consecutive quarters of decline signaling operational issues.

**Take Rates (Platform Economics)**
Mentioned for MercadoLibre's merchant strategy: "lowering take rates and shipping thresholds have successfully attracted new merchants," illustrating marketplace dynamics and competitive positioning.

**Intent-Driven Advertising**
Amazon's advertising advantage: "when people go to amazon.com, their intent is to buy something," making ads "far more lucrative" than Meta or Google where users must be convinced to buy when that wasn't their original intent.

**Returns on Capital Employed (ROCE)**
Used to explain Costco's premium valuation: "Costco maintains an incredibly high PE ratio because it has high returns on capital employed meaning it can take a small amount of money invest it and get super high returns."

**ISM (Institute for Supply Management Index)**
Mentioned by Tom Lee as economic indicator: "I do think business confidence picks up that means that ISM starts to recover and it is a broadening trade." Used as proxy for manufacturing/services sector health.

**Forward P/E Ratio vs. Trailing P/E**
Distinguished throughout analysis, with forward P/E used for valuation targets and trailing P/E used for historical compression analysis (e.g., Chipotle from 55 to 27 trailing P/E).

**Free Cash Flow Yield**
Primary valuation metric used across all names, with 3-7% yields discussed as attractive entry points depending on growth profile.

**Multiple Compression/Expansion**
Core investment framework: identifying companies where multiples have compressed due to sentiment (Adobe, Chipotle) with expectation of normalization driving returns even with modest growth.

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modeling**
Used extensively with Qualrrim platform, applying simple inputs: trailing EPS/FCF, growth rate, terminal multiple, and terminal yield to calculate expected returns.

**Autonomous Vehicles (AV) Disruption**
Discussed as structural risk for Uber but paradoxically lower risk for DoorDash because DoorDash can partner with AV providers rather than compete: "DoorDash in some ways may actually be more insulated from technological advancement than Uber."

**Customer Deposits (Fintech Accounting)**
Explained for MercadoLibre's MercadoPago: "they get that cash in today, but they don't really own that money. They're just holding that cash flow for their customers," causing FCF to appear inflated and requiring adjustment for accurate valuation.

**Subscription Business Model Layering**
Central to Amazon/Costco/Walmart grocery thesis: using low-margin groceries as "Trojan horse for a subscription business, which is super high margin," creating high lifetime value and customer retention.

### Tools/Platforms Mentioned

**Qualrrim (qual.com)**
Carlson's proprietary stock analysis platform mentioned in sponsorship: "Qualum turns you into a super investor by making it extremely easy to see which companies are really good companies and which ones aren't... premium tool allowing for KPIs where you can see revenue breakdowns, discounted cash flow calculators, earnings calendars, transcript summaries, AI portfolio analysis."

Mentioned as previous signup method for Qualrrim before direct signups became available: "No need to use Patreon. You can simply go to qualum.com."

### Entities/People Mentioned

**Tom Lee (Fundstrat)**
Market strategist appearing on financial media defending the bull market thesis. Characterized as "not too concerned about the market selloff" and emphasizing AI productivity miracle remaining intact. Advocates for broadening trade with Fed clarity driving business confidence.

**Dan Ives (Wedbush)**
Tech analyst with aggressive NASDAQ targets: predicting "NASDAQ like 25,000, NASDAQ like 30,000 next two three years" based on belief that "street's underestimating numbers by 20 to 30% next few years" on AI trade.

**Mary Erdoes (JPMorgan)**
Mentioned by Tom Lee as acknowledging "there's been a payoff in spending" on AI investments, validating the productivity thesis.

**Lisa Su (AMD CEO)**
Cited by Tom Lee as "noting that productivity lift is the reason AI spending is rising," providing validation from semiconductor perspective on AI infrastructure build-out.

**Bill Ackman (Pershing Square)**
Used as cautionary example of sophisticated investor capitulating at wrong time: sold Netflix "when he was very uncertain and unsure about the future," missing subsequent recovery and outperformance.

**Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy)**
Subject of "Fail of the Week" segment for posting AI-generated image showing him fleeing sinking, burning Titanic-like ship on a life raft alone while titled "HODL." Criticized as poor optics for "the leader of Bitcoin" to be "fleeing the ship as the captain" while others sink.

### Miscellaneous Concepts

**The Fed Pivot / Rate Cut Debate**
Referenced by Tom Lee: "The Fed is a little hesitant. The reason to cut in December, but the reason they're hesitant to cut is the economy is actually pretty healthy," creating uncertainty but ultimately healthy backdrop for earnings.

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
Amazon's cloud segment, critical catalyst for stock with re-acceleration above 20% growth rate being major bull case validation.

**MercadoPago**
MercadoLibre's fintech arm: "their fintech portion. So this is a company that's growing in retail and they've leveraged that into fintech," providing dual revenue streams similar to Amazon's multi-vertical model.

**Prime Video**
Amazon's streaming service, characterized as "likely number two in the world in streaming behind Netflix" with "massive ad reach, more ad reach than any platform today."

**Whole Foods**
Amazon's grocery subsidiary: "They already have Whole Foods established all throughout the nation," providing infrastructure for grocery expansion despite not having "quite the presence of Walmart."

**Red Dead Redemption 2 Mobile**
Netflix gaming partnership: "they're licensing Red Dead Redemption 2 for mobile. So that's going to be part of a Netflix membership," expanding gaming strategy beyond original titles.

**Party Games (Netflix)**
New Netflix initiative: games played on TV using phone as controller, requiring no additional hardware: "Now they're introducing it as social games, ones that you play on the couch with friends in front of the TV."

**Firefly (Adobe AI - implied)**
Though not explicitly named, Adobe's AI integration is implied in discussion of company navigating AI competition while maintaining revenue growth and performance obligation increases.
