# 3. Core Arguments, Opinions & Viewpoints

## The Dark Mode Preference Declaration

**Main Point:** The presenter expresses a clear personal preference for dark mode over light mode in user interfaces, framed with humor.

**Supporting Statement:**
When demonstrating the platform's ability to switch between light and dark display modes, the presenter states: "I'll stick to dark because I'm not a sociopath."

**What This Reveals:**
This is the only explicit opinion expressed in the tutorial that isn't directly related to trading utility. The humorous framing suggests the presenter views light mode as an uncomfortable or impractical choice, likely due to eye strain or aesthetic preference. This brief personal commentary serves to establish a casual, relatable tone with the audience while demonstrating a customization feature. The statement implies that among power users or serious traders, dark mode is the expected or "normal" choice, positioning light mode users as outliers.

## The Platform Agnosticism Statement

**Main Point:** The presenter establishes independence from Velodata to maintain credibility and objectivity.

**Direct Quote:**
"I want to mention I not affiliated with vataa I not paid to make this video this is just a me recording a video that was popular and done well."

**Purpose and Implications:**
This disclaimer serves multiple functions. First, it establishes the presenter's credibility by removing potential conflicts of interest—viewers can trust that recommendations aren't motivated by sponsorship. Second, it indirectly validates the platform's quality by explaining the video exists because a previous tutorial "was popular and done well," suggesting genuine community interest rather than promotional motivation. Third, it positions the presenter as an educator sharing valuable tools with the community rather than as a marketer. This type of transparency is important in cryptocurrency trading communities where undisclosed partnerships and paid promotions are common concerns.

## The API Boundary Setting

**Main Point:** The presenter establishes clear limits on their expertise and scope of instruction.

**Direct Quote:**
When showing the API button on the main page, the presenter states: "API which you can read all about I'm not the developer."

**What This Means:**
Rather than attempting to explain features beyond their expertise, the presenter openly acknowledges their limitations. This statement serves to: (1) Maintain credibility by not overreaching into technical areas where they lack specialized knowledge, (2) Direct users to appropriate resources (the documentation), and (3) Focus the tutorial on practical usage rather than technical implementation details. This approach reflects a teaching philosophy that values honesty about knowledge boundaries over attempting to appear omniscient.

## The Options Trading Disclosure

**Main Point:** The presenter honestly communicates their lack of expertise in options trading rather than attempting to explain features they don't personally use.

**Direct Quote:**
"Since I'm not an options Trader and do not actively utilize options data I will simply screw scroll through this tab."

**Supporting Context:**
The presenter still shows the Options section interface and mentions specific features like "you can add Greeks over here" and "you can look at most traded options in the last 24 hours and you can see all sorts of IV meaning implied volatility data," but explicitly frames this as surface-level guidance rather than detailed instruction.

**What This Reveals About Teaching Philosophy:**
This approach demonstrates intellectual honesty in educational content. Rather than pretending expertise or providing superficial explanations that might mislead viewers, the presenter: (1) Acknowledges the feature exists for those who need it, (2) Provides basic terminology and navigation guidance, (3) Explicitly states their limitation, and (4) Moves on to areas where they can provide valuable insight. This serves viewers better than false confidence, as options trading requires sophisticated knowledge that shouldn't be casually explained by someone who doesn't actively trade options.

## The Personal Workflow Revelation

**Main Point:** The presenter identifies the Chart section and orderflow indicators as their primary area of professional focus.

**Direct Quote:**
"This is the part I personally utilize the most" (referring to the Chart section).

**Supporting Evidence:**
The presenter dedicates significantly more time and detail to the Chart section compared to other sections. When demonstrating indicators, they state: "I will walk you through how to add most commonly used orderflow indicators because that's what I do." They provide a detailed walkthrough of their specific setup, including spot CVD and volume CVD configuration, and show their preferred visual arrangement with indicators stacked on existing panes.

**What This Means:**
This disclosure provides crucial context for viewers. The tutorial's focus reflects the presenter's actual trading methodology—they are a day trader who relies heavily on orderflow analysis. This explains: (1) Why certain sections (TradFi, Market, Futures) receive cursory coverage while Chart receives extensive detail, (2) The specific indicators chosen for demonstration (aggregated data, liquidations, open interest, spot volume, volume, and funding), and (3) The emphasis on customization features that matter for active trading (multiple timeframes, quick filtering, real-time data). This transparency helps viewers understand that the tutorial reflects one trading style among many possible approaches.

## The Visual Preference for Clean Interfaces

**Main Point:** The presenter values minimal visual clutter in their trading interface.

**Direct Quote:**
After collapsing indicator labels on the left side of charts: "I personally am pretty annoyed by these text at the left you can click at this arrow and this is much cleaner look."

**What This Reveals:**
This statement provides insight into professional trading interface design preferences. For active day traders monitoring multiple indicators and potentially multiple charts simultaneously, every pixel of screen space matters. The "cleaner look" isn't just aesthetic—it's functional, allowing more focus on price action and indicator readings without distraction from text labels. This comment implicitly recommends this setup to viewers who share similar trading styles, suggesting that professional traders optimize their workspace for information density and visual clarity.

## The Documentation Recommendation

**Main Point:** The presenter strongly encourages users to consult official documentation before using the platform.

**Direct Quote:**
When showing the Velodata documentation link: "which I highly recommend before you start using the app."

**Reasoning:**
This recommendation reflects best practices for using complex financial tools. While the tutorial provides a practical walkthrough, the presenter recognizes that: (1) Documentation contains comprehensive information beyond a single video's scope, (2) Users may have specific needs not covered in a general tutorial, (3) Official documentation is authoritative and will be kept up-to-date with platform changes, and (4) Serious users should invest time in thorough learning rather than relying solely on a video walkthrough. This advice positions the tutorial as a starting point and orientation rather than a complete reference.

## The Day Trading Workflow Perspective

**Main Point:** The tutorial consistently frames features through the lens of day trading utility.

**Supporting Evidence Throughout:**

**In the Market Section:**
"These settings can be very useful for day Traders because they can see top performing coins of the last 60 Minutes."

**In the Watchlist Configuration:**
"As a day trader you can you might want to choose the columns that are very useful for you so as a day somebody trading alt coins intraday 10- minute change 7-Day change 10 minute volume."

**What This Reveals:**
The presenter's identity as a day trader shapes every demonstration choice. They focus on short timeframes (10-minute changes, hourly top gainers), high-frequency data (minute-by-minute volume, real-time liquidations), and rapid filtering capabilities. This contrasts with features that might be more relevant to longer-term investors (like multi-year CME data views or options Greeks). The tutorial implicitly argues that Velodata's value proposition is strongest for active traders who need granular, real-time market data rather than investors seeking long-term trend analysis. This perspective doesn't diminish the platform's utility for other trading styles, but it does reveal the presenter's professional context and explains their feature prioritization.

## The Mobile Accessibility Note

**Main Point:** The presenter highlights that mobile functionality is a notable feature of the platform.

**Direct Quote:**
"What is also worth mentioning is that site works well on mobile and when you bookmark it you can add it to your home screen so it pretty much uh works as an app on your phone."

**What This Implies:**
This observation suggests that mobile accessibility is somewhat unusual or noteworthy for advanced cryptocurrency trading analytics platforms. The presenter considers this worth explicitly mentioning, implying that many comparable tools may not offer functional mobile experiences. For day traders, having mobile access to real-time data and charts enables monitoring positions and market conditions away from a desktop setup. The bookmark-to-home-screen feature that makes it behave "as an app" suggests the platform uses progressive web app (PWA) technology, providing a native app-like experience without requiring app store downloads. This is presented as a convenience and accessibility advantage.

## The Flexibility and Customization Philosophy

**Main Point:** Throughout the tutorial, the presenter consistently emphasizes that nearly every element of the platform can be customized to individual preferences.

**Supporting Evidence Across Multiple Sections:**

**Visual Settings:**
"You can change the colors as you like I personally like this color scheme."

**Data Display:**
"You can also have the charts displayed in coins instead of dollars because as price of Bitcoin goes up it might eventually be benefit IAL to look at open interest in coins instead of dollars as it's less noisy."

**Timeframes:**
Repeatedly demonstrates that timeframes can be changed globally or individually for each chart window.

**Indicator Configuration:**
"There's a lot of settings and functionality within most of them."

**Layout Options:**
"You can have several charts at the same time so maybe you want to have Bitcoin at left and right ethereum or any other altcoin as many as you like."

**What This Sustained Emphasis Means:**
This consistent focus on customization options reflects a core argument about what makes trading platforms valuable: flexibility to accommodate diverse trading styles and preferences. The presenter's repeated demonstrations of "you can change this" and "this is adjustable" communicate that Velodata is designed as a toolkit rather than a prescriptive system. This philosophy serves both beginners (who can start with defaults and gradually customize) and advanced traders (who can optimize the interface precisely for their methodology). The "as many as you like" and "choose whatever option you like" language reinforces user agency and suggests the platform won't artificially limit professional users' needs.
