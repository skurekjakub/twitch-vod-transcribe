# 5. Key Conclusions, Predictions & Takeaways

## Platform Access and Preparation

* **Read the documentation before using the app** - The presenter highly recommends consulting Velodata's official documentation before starting to use the platform to ensure proper understanding of features and functionality.

* **Verify official channels** - Check the official email address and verified Twitter accounts to avoid phishing or fake sites. The presenter specifically points these out on the main page as authentication measures.

* **Account creation is required** - Users cannot access Velodata features without creating an account or signing up; it's not an open-access platform.

* **Mobile functionality is available** - The platform works well on mobile devices and can be added to the home screen to function like a native app, providing flexibility for monitoring markets on the go.

## Interface Customization Best Practices

* **Use dark mode** - The presenter recommends dark mode as the preferred setting (though this is presented humorously, it reflects common trader preference for reduced eye strain during extended screen time).

* **Optimize visual settings for your workflow** - Customize color schemes, chart backgrounds, and candle colors to create an interface that's comfortable for extended use and reduces visual fatigue.

* **Minimize visual clutter** - Collapse indicator labels and text elements that aren't essential to free up screen space and reduce distraction, creating a "cleaner look" focused on data.

* **Adjust pane sizes based on importance** - Allocate more vertical space to indicators you monitor most actively and compress less critical data windows.

## Data Display Configuration

* **Consider coins vs. dollars for open interest** - As Bitcoin price increases, viewing open interest in coins rather than dollars reduces noise and provides clearer signals about actual position changes independent of price appreciation.

* **Synchronize timeframes globally or customize individually** - For broad market overview, change timeframes globally to see consistent time periods across all charts. For detailed analysis, adjust individual charts to different timeframes to compare short and long-term dynamics.

* **Use appropriate timeframes for your trading style** - Day traders should focus on shorter timeframes (10-minute, hourly, 1-day) while longer-term traders can use weekly, monthly, or yearly views.

## Watchlist Management

* **Create custom watchlists for focused monitoring** - Rather than scrolling through hundreds of cryptocurrencies, build curated lists of coins relevant to your trading strategy or research focus.

* **Configure columns to match your trading style** - Day traders should select metrics like 10-minute change and 10-minute volume; swing traders might prefer 7-day change and funding rates; long-term investors might focus on market cap and FDV.

* **Maximum eight columns per watchlist** - Plan your most critical metrics carefully as the platform limits watchlist columns to eight to maintain usability.

* **Use sorting to identify opportunities quickly** - Click column headers to sort by that metric, rapidly identifying top gainers, highest volume, or extreme funding rates.

* **Access watchlists across different sections** - Custom watchlists integrate throughout the platform, allowing consistent filtering whether you're in Market, Futures, or Chart sections.

## For Day Traders Specifically

* **Focus on the Market section for opportunity identification** - Use 1-hour or 10-minute timeframes with "top gainers" filtering to spot momentum quickly.

* **Monitor open interest changes actively** - This metric is "very useful for Traders to see what the activity actually is," revealing whether new positions are being established or closed.

* **The Chart section is essential for execution** - Most active trading decisions should be made from the Chart section where orderflow indicators, real-time price action, and technical analysis tools converge.

* **Configure orderflow indicators for intraday analysis** - The presenter's indicator stack (aggregated data, liquidations, open interest, spot volume, volume, funding) represents a comprehensive orderflow setup for short-term trading.

## Indicator Configuration

* **Convert volume indicators to CVD for better insight** - Standard volume bars show activity level; cumulative delta reveals the balance between buying and selling pressure, providing actionable directional signals.

* **Layer multiple CVDs for comprehensive analysis** - Stack both spot CVD and futures CVD on the same pane to see how derivatives traders and spot traders are positioned relative to each other.

* **Move indicators to existing panes to maximize chart space** - Rather than dedicating separate panes to each indicator, overlay related indicators to see more information with less scrolling.

* **Explore extensive settings for each indicator** - Don't accept default configurations; most indicators have "a lot of settings and functionality" that can be tuned to your specific analytical needs.

* **Switch between dollar and coin denomination based on context** - For open interest and other metrics, test both display formats to see which provides clearer signals in current market conditions.

## Multi-Asset Monitoring

* **Use multiple charts simultaneously for correlation analysis** - Set up Bitcoin alongside altcoins to see how they move relative to the market leader, or compare multiple altcoins in the same sector.

* **No limit on chart count** - The platform allows "as many as you like," enabling comprehensive multi-asset monitoring limited only by screen real estate.

## Understanding Market Structure

* **CME data reveals institutional activity** - The TradFi section showing CME futures and options provides insight into how traditional financial institutions are positioning in cryptocurrency markets.

* **Returns by session identify geographical patterns** - Understanding whether an asset performs better during Asian, European, or US trading sessions helps time entries and exits.

* **Exchange-specific open interest shows liquidity concentration** - Knowing that "most volume is done on binance" for a particular asset helps determine where to execute trades for best fills.

## Learning Path

* **This is an update tutorial, not a complete beginner's guide** - The presenter assumes viewers have basic familiarity with Velodata from a previous tutorial, focusing on new functionality rather than comprehensive introduction.

* **Options require specialized knowledge** - The presenter's honest acknowledgment that they don't actively trade options and thus skip detailed coverage serves as a reminder that advanced features require corresponding expertise to use effectively.

* **API access is available but requires technical knowledge** - The platform offers API access for programmatic data retrieval and trading, but the presenter defers to documentation rather than attempting to explain developer-focused features.

## General Trading Wisdom Implicit in the Tutorial

* **Tools alone don't create edge** - The presenter focuses on their personal workflow (day trading with orderflow indicators) rather than claiming the platform creates universal advantage, implicitly acknowledging that tools must match methodology.

* **Information density is valuable for active traders** - The emphasis on customization, multiple simultaneous charts, and granular timeframes reflects that professional traders need to process large amounts of data efficiently.

* **Different sections serve different purposes** - TradFi for institutional sentiment, Market for opportunity scanning, Futures for deep-dive analysis, Chart for execution. Understanding these distinct functions optimizes workflow.

* **Real-time data matters for short-term trading** - The presenter's example of Solana's "Biggest Gainer has been around actually around this time as I'm recording right now" demonstrates that minute-by-minute data freshness is critical for the strategies this platform supports.

## Platform Legitimacy and Trust

* **Independent review adds credibility** - The presenter's explicit disclaimer ("I not affiliated with vataa I not paid to make this video") followed by voluntary tutorial creation suggests genuine value rather than paid promotion.

* **Previous tutorial was well-received** - The reason for this update video is that the first tutorial "was popular and done well," indicating community validation of both the content and the platform.

* **Verification features protect users** - The emphasis on checking official email addresses and verified Twitter accounts acknowledges the cryptocurrency space's security concerns and scam prevalence.
