## 1. Executive Summary

This livestream represents a highly volatile trading session dominated by significant biotech binary events and ongoing quantum computing short positions. The dominant sentiment is bearish on quantum computing stocks with a nuanced bullish-to-neutral stance on select biotech names, tempered by significant regulatory uncertainty. The stream centers around three major Q3 earnings releases (Sarepta Therapeutics, Palantir Technologies, and Hims & Hers) and the aftermath of a failed confirmatory trial (Essence) for Sarepta's Duchenne muscular dystrophy therapies. The analyst maintains a concentrated short position in quantum computing stocks (D-Wave, Rigetti, BTQ, QC Watt) while navigating biotech volatility, particularly UniQure's FDA rejection and Sarepta's disappointing trial results. The portfolio demonstrates extreme volatility, fluctuating between 170% and 400% returns due to small base capital and concentrated positions.

## 2. Ticker-Specific Analysis

### 2.1. Major Ticker Discussions

#### **$SRPT (Sarepta Therapeutics)**

**Disease Background:** Sarepta develops therapies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a fatal genetic disease affecting primarily boys. Patients progressively lose muscle function, becoming wheelchair-bound in their teens and typically dying from respiratory/cardiac failure in their 20s-30s. Sarepta's PMO (phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer) therapies work by "exon skipping" - helping cells produce a partially functional version of the missing dystrophin protein.

**FDA Approval Pathway Context:**
The U.S. has two main drug approval pathways:
1. **Traditional Approval:** Requires definitive proof of clinical benefit via rigorous trials (typically double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies with clear statistical significance, p<0.05)
2. **Accelerated Approval:** For serious diseases with unmet needs, FDA can grant conditional approval based on "surrogate endpoints" (indirect measures like protein expression) while requiring companies to conduct confirmatory trials proving actual patient benefit

Sarepta's three PMO drugs (Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, Amondys 45) received accelerated approvals between 2016-2021 based on showing they could produce dystrophin protein in muscle biopsies. The FDA required a confirmatory trial ("Essence") to prove these drugs actually slow disease progression in patients.

**Investment Thesis:** 
Long position based on conviction that despite the Essence trial failing its primary goal, the combination of (1) real-world evidence from 1,800+ treated patients, (2) subgroup analyses, and (3) FDA's written commitments will result in drugs staying on market and potentially converting to traditional approval.

**Key Catalysts:** 
  - **Q3 Earnings:** $399M total revenue ($370M net product revenue) - solid performance despite temporary shipping pause
  - **Essence Trial Results (Critical Binary Event):** 
    * **Primary endpoint MISSED:** Failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.31) on four-step stair climb test
    * **What this means:** In the full study, treated patients showed numerical improvement vs. placebo, but results could have occurred by chance 31% of the time (vs. required <5% threshold)
    * **COVID-adjusted subgroup:** When excluding 57 patients affected by pandemic disruptions (missed doses, lockdown deconditioning), remaining 168 patients showed p=0.09 (30% reduction in disease progression) - approaching significance
    * **"Enriched population" analysis:** Using validated prognostic scoring to identify patients most likely to progress, study achieved p=0.01 (statistically significant, 35% slowing of decline)
  - **Label update:** FDA approval expected imminently to remove non-ambulatory (wheelchair-bound) patients from approved indication pending safety study results with immunosuppressant drug serolimus
  - **FDA meeting:** Company requesting Type A meeting by year-end to discuss path to maintaining approval and potential traditional approval conversion

* **Technical Levels:** Aggressively accumulated during after-hours panic selling from ~$23 down to $18.44, with purchases at $19.35, $18.44, and $18.35 (total 4+ tranches). Stock dropped ~20-30% on trial results. Analyst characterized this as extreme capitulation presenting buying opportunity.

* **Regulatory Context & Bull Case:** 
The analyst believes market overreacted because:
  1. **Written FDA standard protects drugs:** FDA explicitly stated marketing authorization would only be withdrawn if "no relevant analyses find sufficient evidence of clinical benefit" - multiple subgroup analyses DO show benefit
  2. **Real-world evidence is compelling:** 
     - 88% reduction in wheelchair risk over 6 years (patients remain walking ~3 years longer)
     - 70% reduction in mortality rate
     - >90% patient adherence despite requiring weekly IV infusions (suggests patients/families see real benefit)
     - Significant delays in pulmonary decline and need for ventilation
     - 1,800+ patients treated globally with favorable safety profile
  3. **"FACO" pattern:** FDA historically reverses course under patient advocacy pressure, especially for rare pediatric diseases
  4. **Ultra-rare disease challenges:** Only 500-800 total U.S. patients per mutation type; disease progresses over decades; COVID pandemic severely disrupted trial - these factors support FDA flexibility
  5. **Recent FDA commentary:** Leadership recently stated p-values of 0.09 may be acceptable for rare diseases (91% confidence vs. traditional 95% threshold)

**Risk Factors Discussed:**
- **Potential PMO withdrawal:** Despite analyst's conviction this is unlikely, FDA could theoretically revoke accelerated approvals if they determine evidence is insufficient (would affect ~$1B+ annual revenue franchise)
- **Commissioner Venet's aggressive stance:** Current FDA leadership taking harder line on therapies lacking definitive proof of efficacy - less willing to accept marginal data than predecessors
- **FDA leadership chaos:** Ted Marsh (senior neuro division official) resigned due to "personal conduct probe" creating uncertainty about who will make final decisions
- **Near-term revenue headwinds:** 
  * Q4 guidance flat-to-slightly-down vs. Q3 due to shipping pause disruption creating 4-6 month patient enrollment delays
  * Seasonal dynamics (holidays, conferences, winter illnesses) reducing Q4 infusions
  * Temporary pause in September (later lifted for ambulatory patients) required families to restart logistics: antibody testing, insurance reauthorization, appointment rescheduling
- **Non-ambulatory market remains closed:** Wheelchair-bound patients (roughly half of potential market) cannot receive Eteplirsen (Exondys) until serolimus immunosuppression study proves safety - expected H2 2026 readout
- **Competitive threat:** Unspecified rival gene therapies seeking approval in 2026 could capture market share

#### **$QURE (UniQure - Huntington's Disease Gene Therapy)**

**Disease & Treatment Background:** Huntington's disease is a fatal inherited brain disorder causing progressive movement, cognitive, and psychiatric decline. UniQure's therapy (AMT-130) is a one-time gene therapy requiring neurosurgery to inject directly into the brain's striatum region. This invasive procedure combined with limited patient population makes conducting traditional placebo-controlled trials ethically and practically challenging.

**Regulatory Event:** FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) - essentially a rejection letter stating the application is not approvable in its current form. This typically requires companies to conduct additional trials or provide substantially more data.

**Investment Thesis:** Speculative long based on "FACO" (FDA Always Chickens Out) theory - FDA may reverse CRL decision under patient advocacy pressure, political dynamics, and precedent for rare disease flexibility despite Phase III data not meeting traditional standards.

**Key Catalysts:**
  - **FDA CRL issued:** Unexpected rejection after company believed approval was achievable
  - **Stock collapse:** Crashed from ~$60s to low-$20s intraday (touched ~$15 at bottom)
  - **Intraday recovery:** Bounced 50% from lows same day (closed ~$22) suggesting some investors betting on reversal
  - **Analyst's prior trade:** Sold entire position during previous run-up around $50-something after 100% gain from ~$30-40 entry
  - **FDA leadership turnover:** Ted Marsh resignation and Commissioner Venet's controversial positions may create opportunity for policy reversal under pressure

* **Technical Levels:** Considering re-entry after 50%+ decline but no specific targets mentioned. Characterized as 50-50 to 60-70% probability FDA reverses decision - explicitly a "gamble" rather than high-conviction investment.

* **Context - Why FDA Rejected:** 
Ultra-rare disease (Huntington's affects ~30,000 Americans) with invasive brain surgery requirement makes powering traditional randomized controlled trials (RCT) extremely difficult. However, FDA appears shifting toward stricter "prove it" mentality requiring double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III trials even for rare diseases, reversing decades of flexibility. 

Analyst acknowledges "FDA is well within their rights" to demand proper Phase III evidence but notes:
- Historical precedent for rare disease approvals on limited evidence
- Current FDA is "quite malleable" compared to past - decisions can be reversed under advocacy pressure
- Patient community activism ("wage bloody war, bloody murder") could force reconsideration
- Estimates stock could reach $100+ if approval granted (current price $20s = 5x upside potential)

**Why Analyst Won't Play It:**
Despite identifying attractive risk/reward (50-70% chance of $100+ stock), explicitly refuses to re-enter position: "I don't want to gamble... I don't want to be involved in a soap opera." Prefers avoiding binary regulatory catalysts that could take months to resolve and create portfolio stress.

**Analyst's Personal Trade:**
- Entered around $30-40 range (implied)
- Sold at $50-something after rapid double (~100% gain)
- Missed re-entry at $15 (100% gain from bottom by end of day)
- Explicitly refuses to re-enter despite attractive setup: "I don't want to gamble"

#### **$DWAV (D-Wave Quantum)**
* **Thesis:** Primary short position. Views company as "basically a fraudulent company" and "one of the most expensive companies in the world" despite lack of commercial viability.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - B. Riley downgraded (analyst jokes this is retaliation for not doing banking business)
  - Earnings scheduled for Thursday (November 7)
  - Down "nicely" during session, providing some relief to short position
* **Technical Levels:** Needs to return to "single digits" to be considered fairly valued. Even then characterized as "very sus."
* **Context:** Part of broader quantum computing short thesis. D-Wave specifically highlighted as worst offender due to annealing technology (not gate-based quantum computing). CEO appeared on Fox Business "pushing for government ownership" despite product not being useful.

#### **$RGTI (Rigetti Computing)**
* **Thesis:** Core short position in quantum computing basket.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - B. Riley downgrade announced during session
  - Trading levels still "way too high" relative to fundamentals
* **Technical Levels:** Actively added to short position during session weakness.
* **Context:** Analyst sarcastically jokes that B. Riley's downgrade is retaliatory: "They're not paying us... Downgrade that shit right now." Notes all quantum stocks move together as a "low quality factor trade" rather than individual fundamentals.

#### **$PLTR (Palantir Technologies)**
* **Thesis:** Not a core position, but trades "usually to the long side." Neutral-to-cautious stance.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - Q3 earnings: Revenue $1.18B (beat expectations)
  - Q4 guidance: $1.13B (vs street $1.18B - significant miss)
  - FY 2025 guidance raised to $4.14B
  - FY 2026 street expectations at $5.63B
* **Technical Levels:** No specific levels mentioned. Expects stock to be "up" after hours but cautions "I would not chase Palantir up here."
* **Context:** Earnings viewed as "pretty good" but not exceptional. Guidance called "monster" but tempered with acknowledgment that bar is already high. Not a portfolio focus - "I don't really follow UNH that closely."

#### **$HIMS (Hims & Hers Health)**
* **Thesis:** Neutral-to-negative based on guidance miss, but potentially bullish on partnership developments.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - Q3 revenue beat
  - Q4 guidance: $605-625M vs. street $632M (significant miss)
  - "Active discussions with Novo Nordisk" disclosed
  - Stock initially fell then reversed to green on Novo news
* **Technical Levels:** None specified.
* **Context:** Initial reaction was confusion about stock moving higher despite guidance miss. Concluded Novo partnership discussions are "pretty bullish" and "better than Novo suing the shit out of them."

#### **$SPRUCE (Spruce Biosciences - Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Therapy)**
* **Thesis:** Long-term venture-like investment with "five bagger or more" potential. High conviction despite illiquidity.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - Added to position during session
  - Characterized as "a lot of cash now" (likely referring to balance sheet)
* **Technical Levels:** Added "a little bit" during session at unspecified prices. Maintains ~5% position.
* **Context:** Treats this as "venture investment that happens to be publicly traded." Acknowledges poor liquidity and advises "you can't overindex to one stock." Expects multi-year hold period - "it's not happening overnight."

#### **Quantum Computing Basket Shorts:**
**$IONQ, $QUBT (Quantum Computing Inc.), $QBTS, $LAZR**
* **Collective Thesis:** All quantum stocks are overvalued momentum/low-quality factor plays with no near-term commercial viability. Shore's algorithm is "not too useful commercially." Grover's algorithm is "kind of a meme" with limited speed-up.
* **Key Catalysts:**
  - IonQ earnings: Wednesday
  - D-Wave earnings: Thursday  
  - Broader "quality factor" mean reversion underway
  - Multiple new quantum companies going public (Penny Lane, Inflection mentioned) creating supply
* **Technical Levels:** 
  - Covered some QBTS ("worthless but don't mind playing ping pong with that one")
  - LAZR characterized as "dog shit"
  - BTQ target below $7
* **Context:** Massive short exposure created extreme P&L volatility. Prior week saw significant losses; this session seeing recovery as quantum names decline. Analyst acknowledges "too many hedge funds in the trade" and expects gains to materialize in 2026 rather than immediate term. Portfolio "shredded" by quantum volatility in preceding weeks but position has "gains to give away."

**Factor Analysis Commentary:**
"If you're short Rigetti, it's no different from being short Ollo is no different from being short Joby. Fundamentals don't matter. It's a low quality factor. That's what's driving it... People these days trade factors more than they trade stocks."

#### **$AVVAX (Likely AstraVax - HPV Vaccine)**
* **Thesis:** Described as "kind of bulletproof" but with patent uncertainty.
* **Key Catalysts:** None specified in this session.
* **Technical Levels:** Mentioned as potential buy.
* **Context:** Used as example that "there's no perfect investment" even for high-conviction names.

#### **$BIOHAVEN (Biohaven Pharmaceutical)**
* **Thesis:** "Really exciting" opportunity following significant decline.
* **Key Catalysts:** FDA neurology division historically "very forgiving" - potential for flexible approval pathway.
* **Technical Levels:** Mentioned stock was "down like 20-30%" creating opportunity, but analyst "didn't get a chance to buy it."
* **Context:** Positioned as potential beneficiary if FDA returns to more lenient approval standards.

#### **$KPTI (Karyopharm Therapeutics - Selinexor)**
* **Thesis:** Heavily bearish - expects stock to go to $2.
* **Key Catalysts:** New data paper mentioned but not reviewed. "Basically can't work. Nobody thinks it works."
* **Technical Levels:** Targeting $2.
* **Context:** Ongoing short position. Characterized as having "no real way" the drug could succeed. Expected data readout "mid-November" but skeptical of any positive outcome.

### 2.2. Minor Ticker Mentions

* **$META** - Analyst states "I like Meta" when asked. No elaboration.
* **$NVDA (Nvidia)** - Up ~4% on session. No specific commentary beyond noting price movement.
* **$UNH (UnitedHealth Group)** - Characterized as "very high quality... large cap, lots of revenue, lots of earnings" when asked. Not actively followed.
* **$VRTX (Vertex Pharmaceuticals)** - Earnings beat mentioned in passing. No analysis.
* **$NWGG (Newegg)** - Confirmed as short position. No elaboration.
* **$AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)** - Mentioned as potential short when earnings approach. No current position.
* **$DENN (Denny's Corporation)** - "Take private" news mentioned. Earnings delayed. No position.
* **$SBUX (Starbucks)** - Breaking news alert: "Starbucks to sell control of China business to Boy Capital in $4 billion deal." No commentary.
* **$KO (Coca-Cola)** - Reference to DCF valuation example in previous streams. No current discussion.
* **Chinese Meat/Pork Stocks** - "China's got some great pork companies. Like they're massive." No specific tickers.
* **$NOVA (Novavax)** - "Haven't looked at Novavax forever." Dismissive tone.
* **$IWD (Ironwood Pharmaceuticals)** - "Don't know a lot about Ironwood." No position.
* **$MONA, $IA** - "Haven't looked at... I've been looking mostly large caps."
* **Beyond Meat** - Mentioned as failed "meme stock attempt." Earnings tonight but not covering.
* **$DXCM (Dexcom)** - Would "like to look at" but not discussed further.
* **Resolute Bio (Huntington's Disease)** - Wondering about November data readout timing.

## 3. Strategies & Theses

### **Quantum Computing Short Thesis**
**Core Logic:** Quantum computing stocks represent a "bubble" driven by momentum/"low quality factor" rather than fundamentals. No commercial viability in foreseeable future. Shore's algorithm (the only meaningful quantum speed-up) is not commercially useful. Grover's algorithm provides minimal speed-up and difficult implementation.

**Execution:** Concentrated short exposure across D-Wave (largest), Rigetti, IonQ, QBTS, BTQ, LAZR. Portfolio estimated 50%+ short quantum at various points. Uses intraday volatility to trim and re-short (covered some QBTS, looking to re-short).

**Risk Management:** Acknowledges "harrowing trade" with multiple weeks of extreme drawdowns. Relies on having gains from other trades to withstand drawdowns. Views 2026 as realistic timeframe for thesis to fully play out. Numerous hedge fund managers similarly positioned and "shredded."

**Expected Catalyst:** Supply increase (multiple new quantum SPACs/IPOs), earnings disappointments, broader "quality factor" mean reversion, potential regulatory scrutiny.

### **Factor-Based Investing Framework**
**Core Logic:** Stock prices decompose into systematic factors (beta, quality, momentum, value, sector, geography, commodity exposure) plus alpha (idiosyncratic return). Most modern trading is factor-based rather than stock-specific.

**Application:** Quantum shorts all move together as "low quality factor" trade regardless of individual company differences. Trade is about timing factor rotation (low-quality stocks outperformed for extended period, now reverting). Analyst compares to Cramer's "Am I Diversified?" segment - holding Rigetti, Ollo, Joby, and UniQure is NOT diversified despite different sectors because all are "ultra long momentum."

**Personal Position:** Short low-quality/momentum factor via quantum names. Long quality/fundamentals via select biotech with real revenues.

**Expected Mean Reversion:** "Low quality outperforming... that factor has to mean revert. It can't go up forever. Unless we're in a new paradigm where low-quality companies somehow beat the odds and all become high-quality companies, which... the likelihood is practically zero."

### **"FACO" - FDA Always Chickens Out**
**Core Logic:** FDA has pattern of initially aggressive regulatory stances that soften under patient advocacy pressure, political dynamics, and industry pushback. This government is "quite malleable" compared to historical FDA rigidity.

**Historical Examples:**
- Sarepta's previous Duchenne approvals (Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, Amondys 45) all received flexibility
- Multiple rare disease therapies approved on marginal evidence
- Contrast to "20 years ago" when FDA decision was final and appeals essentially impossible

**Current Applications:**
- UniQure: 50-70% chance of CRL reversal despite weak data
- Sarepta: High confidence in continued marketing authorization; potential traditional approval conversion
- General biotech: Worth attempting aggressive advocacy campaigns

**Execution Strategy:** For UniQure specifically - "wage bloody war, bloody murder... go to war here for our patients... you just go ham... as I've said before like it's a hundred plus dollar stock if they got approval... you know it's a riskadjusted gamble."

**Analyst's Restraint:** Despite identifying FACO opportunities, explicitly refuses to participate in UniQure speculation: "I don't want to be involved in a soap opera."

### **Biotech Binary Event Management**
**Core Logic:** "When I'm dealing with a binary endpoint, I try to clear my portfolio and just focus on that."

**Execution:** Attempts to reduce overall portfolio risk before major known catalysts (e.g., Karyopharm data in mid-November). Selling into strength when binary events resolve favorably (sold UniQure after doubling despite believing in higher prices).

**Position Sizing:** Never go "all in" on single binary event. Used as explicit example: Random viewer went 40-50% of portfolio into UniQure and got "shredded." Analyst went smaller and exited after 100% gain.

**Philosophy:** "Either you have the nuts [strong hand]... you got to be really careful about drug development because it's like just the craziest risk you're taking putting your everything in... is regulated by FDA... FDA at any moment can decide 'No, we're going to do it this way'... you want to deliver results that are like, 'Okay, we hit statistical significance.'"

### **"Losers Average Losers" - Position Sizing Discipline**
**Core Logic:** "Most famous saying in trading is losers average losers." Don't mechanically add to losing positions just to lower average cost.

**Application:** If you bought stock at $150 expecting $500, and it drops to $100, that doesn't automatically mean you should "double down" or "triple down." Only add if: (1) serious price dislocation occurred, (2) opportunity is better than other available options, (3) conviction genuinely increased (not just because it's cheaper).

**Warning Signs of Bad Averaging:** "That's a loser mentality... If your average is 150 and the stock's at 140, you shouldn't be sitting there saying 'Oh I got to double down and lower my average.'"

**Sarepta Example:** Added aggressively during after-hours capitulation from $23 to $18 because viewed as panic-driven dislocation with unchanged fundamentals, NOT simply because position was down.

### **Drug Development Risk Framework**
**Core Philosophy:** "You either have the goods or you don't... if you don't have the nuts [poker reference], you got to be really careful about drug development."

**Ideal Scenario:** Hit primary endpoint with statistical significance. "You want the FDA to roll out the red carpet for you and be like 'We're so proud of you guys. Way to go.'"

**Undesirable Position:** "Hat in hand" to FDA begging for approval on marginal data (e.g., UniQure, Sarepta's current Essence situation). "You don't want to ever be in that position in life where you're sort of begging and pleading."

**Rare Disease Exceptions:** FDA historically more flexible for ultra-rare diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, DMD, SMA). But trend may be reversing to "prove it" mentality requiring double-blind placebo-controlled trials regardless of disease rarity.

**Personal Investment Approach:** Would "never want to be UniQure or Sarepta as a company owner... because you're going to FDA with a hat in hand." Prefers investing in companies with clear efficacy.

### **Real-World Evidence (RWE) Strategy**
**Application to Sarepta:** Extensive RWE showing:
- 88% reduction in wheelchair risk for Vyondys (3-year delay in loss of ambulation)
- 2.6-year delay in pulmonary decline  
- 70% reduction in mortality
- >90% patient compliance (significant given weekly IV infusions)
- 1,800+ patients treated worldwide

**Regulatory Strategy:** Use RWE as "totality of evidence" alongside failed confirmatory trial to argue for continued approval and potential traditional approval conversion.

**Broader Philosophy:** For rare diseases with decades-long disease progression and tiny patient populations (500-800 prevalent cases), RCTs are "particularly challenging" to power properly. RWE becomes critical supplementary data.

### **"Kitchen Sink" Earnings Guidance**
**Observation:** Companies intentionally set very low guidance bars to ensure beats. 

**Sarepta Q4 Example:** Street expects $336M (Q3) and $351M (Q4). Analyst: "That's like too low. It's insanely low... Almost practically impossible [to miss]... Seems really hard to achieve."

**Interpretation:** Company is "telling the street what to do" - setting expectations they can easily exceed. Views anything above $90M for certain segment and $225M for PMOs as "great" despite much lower guidance.

### **Technical Chart Pattern Recognition - "Ping Pong" Trading**
**Application:** QBTS (Quantum Computing Inc.) specifically characterized as suitable for "playing ping pong" - buying weakness, selling strength repeatedly.

**Rationale:** Stock is "worthless" fundamentally but has volatility that creates trading opportunities.

**Limitations:** Doesn't apply to larger quantum shorts like D-Wave or Rigetti where analyst maintains directional short bias.

## 4. Market Trends & Trading Psychology

### **Broad Market Trends**

**Quality Factor Reversal (Primary Theme):**
- "Quality had been vastly underperforming and now quality is outperforming and it blew out so hard. There was just no way for quality to stay that low."
- Low-quality stocks (no revenue, unprofitable, high momentum) significantly outperformed 2024-Q3 2025
- Renaissance Technologies also took pain on this trade
- Reversal underway: SPY flat, NVDA up, quantum/growth decimated during this session
- "That factor has to mean revert... unless we're in a new paradigm where low-quality companies somehow beat the odds and all become high-quality companies, which... the likelihood is practically zero."

**Biotech Regulatory Environment:**
- FDA in "disarray" with "chickens clucking" (chaotic)
- Commissioner Venet taking aggressive stance (less forgiving than predecessors)
- Ted Marsh (senior FDA official) resigned due to "personal conduct probe" creating leadership vacuum
- Shift toward "prove it" mentality - double-blind placebo-controlled trials becoming mandatory even for rare diseases
- Contrast to "20 years ago" flexibility for rare diseases (Gaucher, early DMD therapies)
- Recent FDA leadership comments suggesting p-values of 0.09 may be acceptable for rare diseases (91% confidence vs traditional 95%)

**Quantum Computing Bubble Dynamics:**
- Multiple new companies going public (Penny Lane, Inflection, "Super Q Quantum Computing Inc") creating supply
- Comparison to Joby (eVTOL) and Ollo as parallel momentum bubbles
- Elon Musk made confusing post about "quantum on the moon" that didn't help sector
- Extropic (thermodynamic computing) getting attention - analyst "happy that Beth is getting some time in the sun"

**Economic Macro (Minimal Focus):**
- Repo rate stress mentioned in passing ("people talking about repo rates and overnight rates stress in the cash system")
- Government debt concerns occasionally mentioned but not analyzed
- Tariffs/trade policy briefly noted in passing
- Fed policy makers "staking up positions ahead of December meeting"
- General dismissive attitude: "I don't really care for economic data in the first place. I'm not a macro guy."

### **Trading Psychology**

**Discipline & Position Sizing:**
- Fundamental rule: "You have to be prepared for every stock in your portfolio to go to zero. Not at the same time, but if there's a stock in your portfolio would really really hurt you if it went to zero, you probably have too much of it."
- Critical of viewer who went 40% into UniQure: "40% of your portfolio is some shit you don't understand... You're betting on who answers the gambling anonymous phone... You're degenerate."
- "1% of your portfolio. Try that first before you try 40%."
- On averaging down: "Losers average losers" - don't reflexively add to losing positions

**Emotional Control:**
- Extensive tirade against viewer who lost money and threatened legal action
- "Get a job. That's what you need to do. Get a fucking job. Investing isn't for you. Quit. Quit investing."
- "I sold all my shit. I'll keep it real with you. I saw a double and I said I'm out. I still have that money. Yours went like this [makes sound effect]. It's gone."
- Acknowledges own emotional challenges: Baby's crying "gives me a headache" but "good parts were more than that way"

**Greed Management:**
- UniQure example: Sold after 100% gain despite believing stock could reach $100+: "There was no reason to stay in there other than greed... if you want the last $2 of every trade you're ever going to make."
- Sarepta positioning: Willing to buy aggressively during capitulation but acknowledges "annoying" to deal with potential multi-month uncertainty

**Experience & Pattern Recognition:**
- "Over the course of your investing career, you should know these companies and stocks really well. I've probably spent 10,000 hours just on Amgen."
- "The pattern recognition and the kind of like feel that some traders and investors have you get a good feeling from that experience."
- "Tenacity is way more important than IQ in investing... IQ probably is a negative after the right amount."
- Optimal IQ for investing: ~120. Beyond that "too smart for their own good" (cites Druckenmiller as example of clever but not quantum physics level)

**Gambling vs. Investing:**
- Explicit distinction: "Our job is not to gamble. You can gamble on any stock on my front screen right now if you want to. That's not what we do. We are trying to be careful allocators of capital."
- "Money is not everything... it's a lot of things, but it's not everything."
- Characterizes overtrading as addiction: "You're no different than the crackhead on the street... That's you. Just admit it."
- Recommends gambling hotline: "1-800-522-4700" for viewer with losses

**Market Stress & Volatility:**
- "This is why people don't trade biotech. This kind of thing. This is why people say no mas. Everybody has to get hit once in biotech and you say 'You know what? Maybe I'm good. Maybe I don't need this shit in my life.'"
- Quantum volatility: "Portfolio is crazy volatile. 170K for me is 300%. 200K is 400%."
- Week prior to session was "really rough" with significant quantum-driven losses
- Philosophy: Keep "some powder dry" and "clear binary event" positions before major catalysts

**Long-term Orientation:**
- Spruce example: "Five bagger or more" expected "but it's going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight."
- "If you're really convinced it's worth 500, it doesn't make a difference if it's 150 or 100 right now... only time it makes a difference is if it gets close to 500, then you got to trim it."
- Willing to hold through significant volatility if fundamentals unchanged

**Risk of Overconfidence:**
- Jokes about "executive or some kind of trust acting on your behalf" conservatorship for viewer who lost money
- "You should not be behind the wheel of any kind of financial transactions. You clearly cannot be trusted and make any sober decisions."
- Self-deprecating about math ability: "I'm happy every time I look at a math book and I find myself confused. I'm a little bit happy because that means that I'm not a genius."

* Don't chase the "last $2 of every trade" out of greed
* When binary events resolve favorably, take profits even if higher prices seem likely
* UniQure example: Sold after 100% gain despite believing $100+ possible - "I thought there were better trades out there"

**Drug Development Investing:**
* "You either have the goods or you don't" - need clear statistical significance
* Avoid companies going to FDA "hat in hand" begging for approval on marginal data
* Even with conviction, be extremely careful with position sizing due to regulatory uncertainty
* "Medicine is messy and it doesn't always work that way" - expect the unexpected

**Factor Awareness:**
* Understand that stocks move together based on systematic factors (quality, momentum, value, size, sector)
* "People these days trade factors more than they trade stocks"
* Diversification requires factor diversification, not just different tickers
* "If you're short Rigetti, it's no different from being short Ollo is no different from being short Joby"

**IQ & Investing:**
* "Tenacity is way more important than IQ in investing"
* Optimal IQ around 120 - beyond that "too smart for their own good"
* "Uncommon common sense" matters more than genius-level math ability
* Experience and pattern recognition ("10,000 hours") more valuable than raw intelligence

**Emotional Control:**
* Recognize gambling addiction patterns - if you can't handle portfolio volatility, "investing isn't for you"
* Don't make threats or blame others for your losses
* "You're 52 years old. You ain't doing shit. Stop fucking threatening me."
* Money isn't everything - maintain perspective

**Opportunity Recognition:**
* "This is the FDA trade. FDA always chickens out." - Look for FACO opportunities in rare disease/biotech
* Extreme capitulation (Sarepta -20-30% after hours) can present buying opportunities if fundamentals unchanged
* "Keep panicking. You panic." - Buy when others are fearful (if conviction justified)

**Portfolio Bonsai:**
* "You always got to stay trimming your portfolio with a bonsai... Stay trimming."
* Continuously rebalance - trim winners, add to high-conviction names on weakness
* Don't let positions become oversized through appreciation

**Long-term Thinking:**
* "If you're really convinced it's worth 500, it doesn't make a difference if it's 150 or 100 right now"
* Wait for thesis to play out - don't panic on short-term noise
* Spruce example: "Five bagger or more, but it's going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight."

**Avoiding "Sword of Damocles" Situations:**
* Don't hold concentrated positions in binary catalyst names unless you can handle either outcome
* "I don't want to be involved in a soap opera" - even attractive risk/reward can be avoided if creates stress
* Better to miss opportunity than overextend and lose capital

**Due Diligence on Rare Disease:**
* For FACO-type situations: "You want to do diligence... talk to people in the Huntington's community, try to rile them up"
* "Wage bloody war, bloody murder... go ham" if pursuing advocacy-based reversal strategy
* Still "riskadjusted gamble" even with edge
