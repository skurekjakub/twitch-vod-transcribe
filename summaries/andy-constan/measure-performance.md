# Measuring Investment Performance 101: The Illusion of Alpha

**By Andy Constan**

Investment performance is one of the most studied topics in finance, yet it remains widely misunderstood. I have strong opinions on this topic, but I will start with my strongest view: **It is almost impossible to determine if an investor truly has the ability to beat the market.**

Beating the market is an extremely difficult feat. While a very few may be able to do it, almost all investors are unable to. Consequently, relying on past performance is often a trap.

### The Statistical Probability of Luck
Track records are generally useless as predictors of future returns. To understand why, we have to look at the math of probability.

If you take 1,000 portfolio managers (PMs) timing the markets, statistically, **172 of them will beat the market 7 or more times out of 10 years by pure luck.**

This means you must set a very high bar for anyone claiming to have beaten the market, because the most likely cause of their outperformance is chance, not skill. Furthermore, almost all track records are too short to be statistically significant.

### The "Easy" Answer: Don't Try
Given the statistical improbability of finding true "alpha" (returns above the benchmark), what should an investor do?

The first answer is simple: **Don't try.**

Adhere to the John Bogle school of thought. Invest in a widely and truly diversified set of investments that are passive. Ensure you pay low or no transaction costs and are charged low or no fees. This is the path of least resistance and highest probability of success for the majority.

### The Hard Path: Evaluating Active Managers
If you absolutely must try to find an active manager, you need a rigorous framework to distinguish skill from luck. Here is what you must look for:

#### 1. Quantitative Validation
You need more than just a good return percentage. You need:
* **Longevity:** The longest possible track record.
* **Systematic Process:** A strategy with no or low discretionary input that can be back-tested for a period longer than the actual track record.
* **Proper Benchmarking:** A benchmark that is highly correlated to the portfolio in question, with the same level of risk and leverage.

You should consider risk-adjusted returns broadly using metrics like the **Sharpe ratio**, **Sortino ratio**, and **drawdown analysis**. However, be aware that even these metrics are often inadequate and statistically insignificant in isolation. It is almost certain that you will fail to generate absolute certainty that a PM can beat the market based on track record alone.

#### 2. The Vital Question: "Who is losing?"
Since numbers can lie, you must dig into the philosophy. By far the most important question I ask a PM is:
> **"Who are you taking your alpha from?"**

For you to win, someone else usually has to lose. Who is losing money that you are making, and why?
* **Red Flag:** If the candidate suggests the other side is "dumb" or "retail," run away as fast as you can. That sort of arrogance reveals ignorance.
* **Green Flag:** Identify if the candidate has a reliable, legal information advantage.

#### 3. Service vs. Speculation
Determine if the PM is providing a service to markets and receiving fair compensation for it. Many PMs provide liquidity for other movers of risk; they receive transaction costs rather than paying them.
* In this case, they are not necessarily "outperforming" markets in a speculative sense.
* Their excess return is compensation for market-making services.
* This can be a perfectly good investment, but it is a different discussion than stock picking.



#### 4. The "Leveraged Beta" Trap
You must strip out all correlation to benchmarks. True Alpha is active management; therefore, the **outperformance should be uncorrelated to the benchmark.**

If the outperformance *is* correlated, it is likely just **Levered Beta** (taking on more market risk to get higher returns).
* Look specifically at what the markets were doing when the PM experienced drawdowns.
* If the PM's drawdowns are strongly correlated to the benchmark's drawdowns, **run away.** It is not skill; it is just amplified risk.

### Operational Red Flags
Beyond the philosophy, you must look at the plumbing of the fund.

#### 5. Transaction Costs & Special Treatment
How much in commissions, bid-offer spreads, and market impact does the PM generate a year?
* **Low costs are good.**
* **High costs are a red flag**, unless the fund is acting as a market maker.
If the costs are high and they aren't providing liquidity, their "edge" is being eaten away by the sell-side.

#### 6. The Personnel Risk
You must analyze the stability of the human capital. Who is on the team?
* **The "IP Theft" Test:** If the strategy is so good, why won't the team members steal the PM's edge, go set up shop away from the firm, and keep the fees for themselves?
* If the answer isn't clear, the stability of the fund is in question.

#### 7. The "Black Box" Warning
If the PM employs a "black box" strategy—an algorithm or method they refuse to explain or cannot articulate—**you are stuck.** Without transparency, you cannot distinguish between a complex edge and a lucky streak.

### The Man in the Mirror: Evaluating Yourself
What if you aren't hiring a manager, but trying to evaluate your *own* performance?

The same problems of track record and luck apply to you. However, you face an additional, dangerous adversary: **Lying to yourself.** This is the trickiest part of investing.

To combat this:
1.  **Focus on Process, Not Outcome:** Do you have a defined investment process? How does it work?
2.  **Check the Discipline:** If you violate your own process, what is the result?
3.  **The "Interview" Strategy:** My strong suggestion is to ask someone to interview *you*. Have them ask the hard questions listed above (Who are you taking alpha from? What is your edge?). You will find it extremely humbling.

---

### The Verdict: The Value of "No"

At the end of the day, precise performance evaluation is almost impossible. What matters is asking the right questions and critically evaluating *how* those questions are answered.

I have done this for many decades. In that time, **I have found certain alpha in less than five cases.** (And for the record, I am not one of those cases; I may not have alpha).

However, there is a victory in rejection. I have easily decided who *not* to invest with. I don't think my count of "false negatives" (rejecting a manager who actually *did* have skill) is high at all. Many people I evaluated had a "fighting chance" of having alpha, but in reality, they were most likely just lucky investors with a decent process.

**The lesson:** The ability to identify and avoid false alpha is just as valuable as finding the real thing.
