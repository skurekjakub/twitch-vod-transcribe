## Trading Philosophy & Market Analysis

### Market Type - "Kangaroo Market"
- **Three market types identified:**
  1. Bull Market
  2. Bear Market  
  3. **Kangaroo Market** (current) - volatile up and down movements
  
- **Best strategy for kangaroo market:**
  - Buy the dips, sell the rips
  - Dollar cost average and forget about it
  - Set buy levels at regular intervals

### Trading vs Investing Split
- **90% of capital: Long-term investments**
- **10% for active trading:**
  - Day trading (for fun, smallest portion)
  - Swing trading (larger active portion)

### Core Philosophy
- "You don't trade stocks to make money"
- "You use the market to grow money, not make money"
- Market always goes back up in long term

## Detailed Trading Strategy Example: NNE

### Buy Levels Strategy
- **Systematic entry points every $2.50 down:**
  - Entry 1: $50.00
  - Entry 2: $47.50
  - Entry 3: $45.00
  - Entry 4: $42.50
  - Entry 5: $40.00
  - Entry 6: $37.50

### Exit/Risk Management Strategy
- **Current price: $41**
- Shares bought at $37.50 and $40.00 are now in profit
- Sets trailing stop losses at breakeven as price moves up
- When price hits $40: Set stop loss on $37.50 entries
- When price hits $42.50: Set stop loss on $40 entries
- Uses 2.5-3% trailing stop losses

### Capital Recycling
- Stop losses trigger → Take profits
- Use profits to buy next dip if it occurs
- If no dip occurs → Have capital for other opportunities
- Maintains original long-term core position (100 shares at $15)
- Only swing trades with additional capital

## Risk Management Details

### Stop Loss Implementation
- Uses **trailing stop losses** of 2.5-3% on swing trades
- Keeps long-term core positions separate
- Never risks entire position on swing trades

### Brokerage Settings
- Prefers **"Last In First Out" (LIFO)** for tax lots when active trading
- Better for frequent up/down trading
- Alternative: "First In First Out" (FIFO)
- Platform automatically handles tax calculations

### Tax Considerations
- Short-term vs long-term gains tracked automatically
- Brokerage provides year-end statement with:
  - Total losses
  - Total wins
  - Wash sale allocations
- Can provide directly to CPA or self-file

### Pattern Day Trading (PDT) Rules
- **Cash account:** No PDT restrictions, can trade with settled cash
- **Margin account:** Need $25,000+ to avoid PDT rule
- "Everybody's different" - individualized approach needed
