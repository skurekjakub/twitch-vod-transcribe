morning.
Big numbers from D-Wave. They beat earnings substantially
and uh Ion Q beat earnings substantially.
Duolingo is a bit of a meme.
Dualingo getting crushed.
And they're off.
I want to look at the Dual Lima numbers. [ __ ] news alert. Nancy Pelosi, first woman to serve as US House Speaker to
retire from Congress. Bye, [ __ ]
[ __ ] Palanteer. It's a good hedge for me against uh
Quantum, but yeah, I don't like the Palunteer falling thing.
I'm also really big in Biohaven. But yeah, here comes the the drop for
Quantum.
Very nice. Very nice.
Let's see here.
Start rolling some puts. Picture me rolling.
Okay.
39 puts. Got to roll those. They see me rolling. They're a
trying to catch me rolling my quantum short exposure.
Let's see.
Wow, look at the wave go. We don't believe you. You need more
people.
Got 31 puts and 30 puts for Dwave that expire
tomorrow. Tomorrow.
Yeah, some got some November 7th paper 14th and
21st.
No more catalysts for quantum. Well, if you listen to Ion Q, they're making a golden dome.
Big ass golden dome. The one time the onetime revenue opportunity.
You think Lockheed and Boeing don't want to make the Golden Dome instead? Now, let's give it to Damassie. He seems
trustworthy. It's a quantum golden dome. It's the
only thing better than a golden dome. Why don't we have a golden dome? What if
that happened to us? We need a golden dome.
It needs to protect me.
Oh boy. 827. [Laughter] You know, we're all thinking it. You all
thinking it. We're all thinking it.
It's okay. We could think it.
Look at uh Lily's data. I don't think Amal's ever

Uh, what? 20% weight loss.
Where did they report this? EAS EASD or something. Let's see.
Where' they report this?
There's a press release. Where the [ __ ] PR Newswire? Why don't I have it?
Oh, there it is. Right there.
Is this monotherapy? How the [ __ ]
How' they do that?
Damn. Damn, that's powerful.
Combine that with GLP and it's it's over. You're going to disappear. There's never going to be a fat person
again. I need a I need like an in-house video
person, producer person that can do media. Otherwise,
I don't know. I can sit and yap, but I want some some cinema.
Yeah, we do a lot of those AI calls, water boy. We did a bunch of them yesterday. There's some funny ones. Sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss.
I had a um Alex Jones was Satoshi. I had
AO sexy AOC. She's out of control. She really she's got to stop.
Um spoken for. Then we got um what we had a a a fiend Warren Buffett. That was
funny. Buffett gave me a million shares of
Bergkshire for some for some Xans.
Peter Chill.
Yeah, Prasad. Prasad and McCary are probably out.
I wasn't away for the whole stream. I was away for a chunk of the stream. Maybe it's two days ago. It's probably
two days ago.
I did buy Biohaven yesterday. I'm regretting it now. I'm I'm impatient.
It'll come back.
This market's pretty ugly. I think shorting ion Q is reasonable.
What's going on with Dolingo? Big ugly drop.
What do they do? Shareholder letter or press release or they do a press release and then they do a shareholder letter.
Man, [ __ ] you ain't Tesla. What are you doing? You can't do that. Why ain't you doing
that?
I swear to God, I I learned all these terms in jail, so I I'm going to be using them for years years to come.
You know, they say you're you are the you are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with. Well, for four and a half years, I spent some time I had to spend a little time
with some not so great people. Okay? Some of them are great. A lot of them are not so great.
I don't know. They always say Dolingo's rip with AI, but what? Dualingo can't use AI.
What? It's off limits to them. It be my numbers. [ __ ]
No. I I don't know what to do with this one. I kind of feel
it's it's sort of this is vibe. You know, you have to vibe with the market. You know, value investing is great, but
if you can vibe with the market, that's even better.
Be one with the market. I'm changing my strat, guys. It's all
vibes now. Why did I buy Palunteer vibes?
Why do I buy Biohaven vibes? All vibes.
[ __ ] it. [ __ ] it. Let's vibe.
Yeah, let's go to Bokeh for Dwave.
Yeah, I could see Open AI buy to Lego to be honest.
No, I don't know. Maybe they I don't know. It's really It's really hard to say.
You know, you do need distribution. It's not that easy to get distribution. People like your app and they use it.
With what money? OpenAI has a lot of money, buddy. Open AAI has unlimited
capital. With what money?
One thing Open AI has, it's money.
Why did I buy Derapim? Well, I do this thing sometimes called capitalism
where I buy things for less than what I think they're worth and then
I profit. Yeah, a [ __ ] profit.
Does that answer the question? Does that answer the [ __ ] question? Who's funding OpenAI? Anybody.
Everybody. Every fund, every person, everyone. No money from OpenAI is going to Elon.

Okay, I'm going to try going long to a lingo. I'm crazy. Crazy.

Yeah, I can turn the volume down.
Use them all for all of Morgan Stanley's kind of the goat prime
broker.
N the [ __ ] Fidelity, Wellington, all the mutual funds. Some of y'all are
bozos, bro. Bozitos.
That was a big word I learned in jail, by the way. Bozo was constantly being used.
I had heard that word forever. I was like, "Boozo?" You know, like a clown. Oh.
And so when when in Rome I that guy's a bozo. They're like, "Yeah,
Martin said bozo. Perfect.
He's a [ __ ] bozo." Like exactly. Yeah,
man. A quarter of of Dolingo's income is [ __ ] uh interest income.
Always bullish. Oh, I didn't know that Bzone layer. I I
invented some other ones, [Music] but Bzone layer is pretty good. I would
There's a hole in the Bzone layer. Oh, maybe that's too high brow of a joke.
I I call people Bzil. Oh, he's a bazillionaire. That was the one I made up. Oh, he's a
millionaire, right? He's a bullionire. So, Mauus actually dropped sequentially
for them a while back, but now they're back up. Is it a 466 here? I don't know.
I like this thing. I always I look at Lego. I always like the financials.
It's It's There's something unhealthy about their business. Well, there's something unhealthy about the product,
too, obviously. But the the really smart money is telling me, don't touch it.
It's actually really toxic situation. They're they're like a Carvana. It's not
as bad as Carvana, but there's something really problematic with the company,
and it's like the numbers look fine. Maybe I'm just not a good analyst, but
I don't see a problem with the numbers. Oh, wow. Look at that quantum dump. I
love it. Super position.
Yeah, I read some of the Elon Sam lawsuit docs. You know, it's just a shame it happened to be this way.
I hate to say that part of it is Elon's ego, you know,
but I think part of it Elon's ego and I like Elon a lot, you know.
I just
Oh yeah. [ __ ] thrilled for mom Donnie.
That's not bullish. I was joking. You don't want to interest is a third of your earnings is not good.
Yep. We're longer up. That had a nice bounce. I sold some on the bounce. Look at
Abbyax 102. What a what a hog. What a horse.
Let me see if it'll let me buy back that Palunteer I sold. Oh yeah, this this app's [ __ ]
I had to sell my Palunteer to clear out margin for Dolingo. Okay, which it let
me then buy Dolingo. But then I bought back my balance here
with day trading margin and they just let me buy the Dualingo.
Does that make sense? Oh man, Palanteer's dropping like a rock.
Like a crack rock. [Music] I keep buying it. I don't care.
I trust Alex. I trust I trust the guys in Boston who are like, "We need to get
AI exposure. It's the biggest trend.
It's the biggest trend in history. We need to own this."
Wait, am I How am I am I long D-Wave?
Oh my god. What?
This must be some kind of mistake.

Huh?
How the hell did that happen?
I was whipping it and flipping it too too too fast.
That's what I do. I whip it. Flip it.
3580. Regetti,
Dolingo, Palanteer, Biohaven, Serupa, ion Q, D-Wave.
My next move is crucial. What do I do? How do I keep it real with Homie and the
crew? I can't play music anymore on YouTube
because I get in trouble. So, I'm gonna have to just
talk to you live.
Yeah, AMD dropping.
Get to the money at all times.
All right, let me see here.
Not sure IQ had an impressive quarter because they keep hiding how much is
coming from their business versus the businesses they bought.
What kind of music do I like? Um, punk, hardcore,
gangster rap. The most aggressive music possible. Loud, noisy, in-your-face.
It's actually not the most aggressive music possible. There is a there are genres that are really
annoying to me. Like there's something called power violence. I don't know if you guys have heard of that. or
real hardcore that has no melody with like metal core. I don't like metal
really.
No death core. No, I don't even know what that is. Like death metal.
Okay, fine. I like emo. Okay, you happy? You [ __ ] happy?
Chopped and screwed for sure.
What do I play in guitar? I don't [ __ ] play anymore, man. I suck.

Brand new deaf tones. I don't like foxing. I've listened to foxing. I don't like boxing. The hotel year. Hotel year
is like my favorite thing. All those adjacent bands like As I Lay Dying or
But they're all titles of [ __ ] novels. What's the other one?
Um, As I Lay Dying is who who wrote that?
That was um Hemingway. Bring me the horizon. There should be
like for whom the bell tolls. That's a [ __ ] sick name for a metal band.
Yeah. Thursday. One of my favorites. Elk 3. L3 is like pop punk. I like that.
But yeah, music. I mean, when you get older, you don't have the [ __ ] time to stay up on music.
I listened to Satan Hall radio while I was in prison because in MDC you can
pick it up and it's like college radio can be pretty good sometimes.
Faulner as I lay dying.
And then there's another metal corlet band that has like a name like this.
Assalam. Morning.
That's the Rick Ross song where it goes Barack Obama whisper assalam alalaykum.
Is is Rick Cross Islam now? Is he Muslim now?
What's Surgical Science? Is that a stock? Is that a company? Is that a band? I don't like mainstream stuff. Like even
deaf tones is too mainstream. I like my bands unheard of.
Um, yeah. I like the be I like the Beatles.
Yeah, Tin Marsh stuff is really crazy.
Theladon. [Music]
All right, enough music talk. Enough music talk.
Alo is like so far to go down. I think Red Hot Chili Pepper is
overrated, too. agree. Okay, let's look let's look at stocks.
All right, so kind of like kind of like Dolingo as crazy as that is.
It was 300 bucks. It's still kind of expensive.
But you can't beat that that growth.
There is the revenue. Open door. Imagine. Imagine buying open
door. Can you imagine?
Adma. What's going on with Adma?
I did not do the architecture of God myself. I'm not that smart.
It's kind of a sick business.
I don't follow Unity that closely. Should I
working capital disaster?
Yeah, looks pretty good actually.
Growth is slowing a little.
Yeah, I'd buy some ADMA. I just my portfolio is quite busy with
other things.
No, I'm sorry, SG. I don't have time.
Mim, it's it's it's a weird mix. If I if I want to really really decide if a
company's undervalued or overvalued, I will do a DCF. But I'm also vibing half the time
You want me to do some job appies?
Couple appies.
DCF is a discounted cash flow.
Open AI can't afford new chips. I don't know about that one. I think they got a
pretty large amount of uh credit line from Nvidia.
So, a lot of demand for their stock. They can sell as much stock as they want. It's just being judicious about
doing so.
Chief Keef does forex. What? Let's go.
That's what I'm talking about.
Sosa 4x
Sammy Sosa
So sir, [Music]
yeah, I don't I don't think people understand AI to be honest, but
It's hard. It's hard to know what's going to happen. It's But I I don't think people are thinking
about it intelligently. I think they're just kind of
pattern matching to stuff that doesn't really apply.
chilling in here.
I'm not sure what's going to happen with Dolingo. I mean, it's hard to tell.
Needless to say. on one hand
I mean listen AI in a vacuum is it's a great technology but you need to apply it you need to make an app that's not
really simple to do and even with open AI I mean you have to
say can you make it it sort of gets l it's sort of lazy if that makes sense a AI chat bots are me are meant to like
just answer one question you you can't say, "Okay, AI, here's
what I'm going to do for the next half an hour. I want you to quiz me, okay?
Quiz me on French. I learned French growing up and I want to, you know, dust
off my rusty French." It won't do that. It can't do that. Dualingo can. It's an application, you know, applications, you
know, that hook you in. So, you have to build an application that's better than Duolingo. That's not easy.
Okay, I'm going to buy more Palunteer. More
betting on this Palanteer bounce.
[Music] Oh boy, it's getting ugly.
Sure. Ugly.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
doing this like history of software. So I'm going through this like old software companies like novel.
Most people forget these companies existed.
You guys know anything about Noville? That's where Eric Schmidt came from.
Well, that was actually pretty big for their time.
They they were like a serious competitor to Microsoft.
Do anybody remember Carell
or Borland?
Hard to count some of these as like e-commerce versus
software. What's the difference?
Anybody
else have some good software history?
Yeah, market's recovering a little bit here.
Not modeling cash flows. I'm just getting some old revenue figures.
Trying to get ready for like what can AI actually bring to the table.
Texas Instruments is not an old software company. They're old hardware company. Come on. Old semiconductor company. Excuse me.
I don't know if that's a underrated book, Paul, because like everybody knows that book
and software, but like I I hear you.
Let's see how back goes. 1996.
Yeah, I'm using some uh what's called uh day trading buying power.
QBasic was always a property of Microsoft. Am I wrong?
I could be wrong.
This isn't a model. This is like trying to synthesize how big the software
industry was before and after various various paradigm shifts.
So has nothing to do with modeling or discounting cash flows or something like that.

You know where you're chasing fibs.
178. Come on. Come on. 178. Should I lighten up on the trade? You think I should lighten up? Book some profits.
Hell no. I kind of probably should lighten up,
right, guys? I think I should lighten up.
I mean, I'm up a little bit right now, you know. I I like I'm almost up. You see the pattern forming? But do you see
this pattern forming? Do you see it forming? I see it. This is the recovery
pattern. We go right back up to 189. Those calls will be worth $9 [ __ ] dollar.
Let's squeeze Bur too. Let's squeeze Bur too. Squeeze his ass. Squeeze him.
Squeeze him. Tom is a good question. I don't know.
20% of the port is in the one DTE. Yeah, it might make sense to, but the pattern
is really promising here.
It's a classic fib retracement.
Well, statistically it doesn't look good.
A fib retracement is what we we use a merker to deploy capital
like capital uh using Fibonacci retracements. Fibonacci was a mathematician
a long time ago for Fibonacci. I was old enough I I met him. I invited him to Omaha.
Come on, man. Give me a 178, man. Give me a 178, please, man. Please.
Please.

Okay, I think it might make sense to be prudent at this point at this juncture.
and sell. Um,
but before we do that, I'm going to ask Chat TPT because Chat TPT can be very helpful in
occasions like this. How can I help you, Martin? Um, my wifey gave me some money to prudently
invest. Uh, but as you know, I am a convicted felon
for fraud. I took the money and I bought
a lot of Palunteer out of the money calls because Alex Karp is cool

one I should sell, two I should tell her?
Thanks.

prudent strategy, but that's your call. Consider consulting a license. What?
Transparency is is the better long-term move since the money is what? explain
what you did, what you've learned, and what steps you'll take to handle what?
Uh, I think we should just let it ride.
You don't have to dump everything. Take partial profits.
See, now it's the the pattern is not going in our direction. We don't want this pattern. This is not the pattern I

Healthy pullback. See,

Yeah. You see the stegosaurus in the chart? You see it?
Everybody sees a Stegosaurus here, man.
Soundhound. Short of the century.
Yeah. I mean, unless they actually put out the revenue, we don't know what to
believe. I think it was all acquired.
I mean, they said it themselves. They only would have grown 7 million year-over-year
if they if they had owned those acquisitions for
two years. So, you think those acquisitions weren't growing?
They really just aren't being transparent.
Sounds short for I mean, if you don't know why sounds so short, I can't help you with investing, man.

Oh, wow. Dwave's made a big comeback, too. All Quantum. Quantum made the comeback, but
less so Palunteer and some other stocks.
Alo.
So this is the price of Palunteer. This is the price of the option.
The option, the price of the option is
very similar directionally to the price of the
underlying, but the
it it's a much bigger percentage changes as you can see.

That's how I'm scamming.
Oh man.
I don't know when the capper readout is coming out. You can look up what the company's told everybody.
man. Meaning of life and what I want to achieve with this life. I want to see these these calls at $3. That's really

I would say.

scammer. Credit card scam.
[ __ ] jinx it.
Does look like Bart Simpson, doesn't it?
I don't know. Palanteer is a good company. I think the fears are overblown. I think Bur is just
crazy.
Is it 400? Are you sure about that?
400. You sure about that?
See here? Let's take a look.
Okay.
Let's take a look. Maybe we should take a look at that.
Yes. Let's see here.
See Sure.
Looks like 200 times earnings
and that's for earnings that are roughly doubling.
It's probably better than that actually. That's kind of current year earnings.
Next year it's actually quite quite a bit better than that.
Yeah. Free cash flow guidance of two billion. So that's just Yeah, it's
probably like a hundred times next year.
Got to learn some basic financial analysis.
Watch my videos.
It's not a lot of it's growing fast. Revenue is grown 60% a year.
That's actually pretty cheap for 60% revenue growth.
Now, will it go up by tomorrow or not is a whole, you know, that's another question.
Bookings, nobody said anything about bookings. Talking about free cash flow.
The only metric that matters in business in case in case you didn't know because it sounds like you don't. Sounds like
you don't. Just sounds like you don't quite
frankly. Pretty much sounds like you don't.
If cash flow, not not earnings. Don't look at earnings. PE is not, you know, your friend here.
By the time E catches up with CF, the stock will be 400.
I kind of like Dualingo.
Yeah, it sounds like you've never valued a growth stock. Feel bad for you.
So, when a company's growing revenue faster than a group of four, that's good. When they do that, let's see, 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 nine. Nine quarters in a row. That's very good. You want that.
That's good.
Okay.
Something about this company's product seems really good.
Don't know what it is, but seems like they're doing a really good job. I mean, I didn't make the company a $400
billion company. That was the market. Wasn't my choice.
Or was it? I'd rather be like Stanfill Capital,
man. I'm short short Tesla.
I hate it when cash flows grow, man. I [ __ ] hate it. That's the worst. I
like shorting stocks. So, the cash flow is growing. That's I just It's such a
bad sign. All right. So, DCF says Palanteer's worth 300 bill.
Not bad. H.
What's How much is that? How much is that per share?
Okay, that's better. If they grow 7% forever,
it's kind of along almost
Let me just add some more years, bro. Let me just add some more years.
Hold on. Let me just add some more ears. Listen,
the bank called up. They said, "We got to make this work." Okay?
They said, "If you don't make this work, you're out of work." said, "All right,
let me see what I can do."
It's kind of already implying that it's going to be one of the biggest
software companies ever. It's kind of that's what it's already um that's what they're already saying.
This is kind of what they're already saying though that it's already pricing that in though. What they don't know is
that this revenue growth from 36
to 39 to 48 to 63. Well, what they're saying next quarter
next quarter is one three. Damn. Okay, look at this.
It's like going to probably be about 70% revenue growth.
Maybe 66, maybe 70. What does that mean? Well, what it means
is this thing is going to just keep accelerating and we have 70%.
And possibly even let's just see how we do on that. 70% that's 7.5. Okay. Have 7.4. Four streets
at what? Six. Okay. Streets at 5.6. Okay.
I'm not even letting them recycle their cash flows. I could recycle the cash flows.
Or I see. Let's say Cart makes 5% on that money. You know, he's good for it.
Okay, that's much better.
Do you think they'll get into CRM?
Well, you got a really good management team here. That's the key.
Yeah, I could I could see go to 250.
Is the market dumping? Got some shorts. Wow, that's rough.
balance is built different. Bro,
I need something to balance my quantum shorts.
Britain losses. Well, we Britain Britain L
I'm on it. Love it.
Hey, supposed to work.
didn't work.
Uh oh. Fake out. The shakeout before the breakout.
The snap. The snapper. This Snapper.
Oh, you sleeping on the snapper? I just Let me sell those. I've just bought a whole bunch of shares. I'm
going to sell them right back. Thank you. Bought them in the bought them at the bottom. Thank you.
Okay. Apparently, I bought some of them at this price. So, let me cool it for now. But you know what I mean.
What's this price improvement? Oh, the [ __ ]
Come on, man. Let me hold the dollar.
We're almost on Capper watch
communications infrastructure.
I don't know. I'm I'm the instinct. I don't think so.
It's not a stock. It's a call option.
Water boy. What? Oh, you're talking to do somebody else.
Uh, I'm trying to I'm long the calls. Look, Martin Skrey
You guys wanted to see some crazy [ __ ]
Then we're going to see some crazy [ __ ] I'm going to place a hundred billion
dollar order at Palanteer, make their numbers go up.
Hello, this is President Obama. I'd like to um
have the DoD order $200 billion of Palunteer software. Please put me on
the phone with Alex Karp.
I care, dumbass. I [ __ ] care. You think I don't care about 50 G's? You're [ __ ] crazy.
You know, one guy put me in jail over 100 G's. He put 100 in my hedge fund. I gave him
800 back. Okay. 8 0 800K.
But it I was late. I was evasive allegedly.
But I told him exactly what was happening. Exactly. I remember the call of a photographic memory. And he was
still upset. [Music]
It's an 100 to 800 forum. Would you take the stand against me? Would you? Who
would do that? Who would do that? Who the [ __ ] would do that?
allegedly
[ __ ] stupid, right?
Oh, he Listen, I'm not saying I did everything right and that I was perfect.
But at the end of the day, all is well that ends well, man. Come on, man.
I would have done things differently in retrospect.
No, he said that's one of the They testified, man. They said it's one of the best one of the best returns they
ever got. But, you know, I didn't I was a young guy. I was new. I didn't really know how
to, you know, run things the right way. But
listen, I gave you 800 back. No, that was over a couple of years.
That wasn't one year. That was over a couple years.
It's not always up to the LPs when investors can get their money. It depends on the documents. Hedge funds are a little [ __ ] up. Hedge funds can
often go left this issue sometimes.
I'm not talking about what the government alleged. I'm talking about why you take the stand. You don't have to take the stand.
Right. I was not guilty on five charges and guilty on three.
Hedge funds are dangerous business. That's right.
Nobody's asking you to trust me.
Take the stand if somebody stole your money. Take the stand if somebody lost your money. Don't take the stand if
somebody made you money, man. What the [ __ ] Get the money back then. Get the
money back.
There you go. Will see
if if the you tell the government that you're going to say whatever you
want to say, they won't call you to take the stand. That's not how it works.
You have to prepare with them ahead of time.
Now, I'm not telling the whole story, but
the part that's important is,
you know, if you're worth, I don't know, 100 mil and you throw a kid 100k and he
