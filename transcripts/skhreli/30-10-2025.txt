Hey guys, thanks for subscribing. Almost 90,000 subs. Make sure you subscribe.
Quantum uh dumped yesterday. Looks like it's dumping today, too. Nvidia
I'm tired. I didn't get a great night of sleep, but
still. No, I don't watch Beyond Meat anymore.
I've moved on to better things.
Pathetic. Ape strong. APE still strong.
The market breath is kind of bad. Nvidia is the only stock doing well. Although at least today, I mean most
we're at an all-time high. I mean all the other stocks are still up a lot. Just talking about right now I guess.
Yeah. Well, Nvidia uh right after we left and went to OpenAI, Jensen was still talking and he was talking about
robotics and I thought that would be that, but it turns out that he said that bookings
for the next five quarters were 500 billion.
Now, a lot of people are trying to figure out what this meant. Did it does it mean that next five quarters of
revenue are 500 billion? That would be well above consensus. So, it's really not clear,
you know, what what the story is there.
Spruce is up from 30 bucks to 120. So, I don't know if what you think getting
wrecked is, but okay. Um, is down from the tippy top.
Volatile biotech.
Um, I'm short Joby here and there. Let me see. What do I want to sell right now? Short some Q.
I'm short a lot of I on Q.
I wasn't really nervous for TV. Spruce is a bigger market cap than that.
They raised they raised shares but uh they sold shares
just made something like a hundred Maybe.
All right, D. Sorry, man. It's fallen a bit from where you bought it probably, right? I bought it at 30.
Did you buy it at 200?
Some of you guys are seem a little overindexed, little overinvested.
I haven't tried graedia yet.
Okay. So, what are you worried about? Stock goes from 130 to 120, you start panicking.
You got to go to meet Kevin, man.
Buy a little spruce just for fun.
Studio lighting. That is true.
Yeah, I really should have bought that INVX or held it, I should say.
Yeah, I do have to do updated, but I need like a content creator to help me or like a producer or video person.
Abby Vax flirting with 100. Who knows? Maybe they'll get bought out.
That's what a lot of people are hoping, but
who knows?
Citadel and Renaissance, very different companies. About as different as it gets.
And uh yeah, you're probably not going to get into Renaissance anytime soon.
Renaissance they call you, not the other way around.
Yeah, if you want to learn about pharmaceuticals, I think the best way to do so is
try um try reading 10ks of drug companies and
biotech companies. You probably learned something.
No, I didn't see that lander. That's so funny and weird. There are a lot of similar places to
Renaissance is pretty they're pretty small. Like Citadel is a big institution.
Um there are a lot of smaller
quant firms that you know are still very successful,
but they're they're more almost like more family style. You know, it's a very tight small group of guys that have been
working together for a long time. Citadel is more of a a meat grinder.
Lad's got it.
Oh, great. We got a math PhD. Wonderful. I was learning about sheav yesterday.
She's schemes. I know about schemes, but not
that kind of scheme. Top news alert. Trump heads to South Korea to face trade talks and North
Korean missiles. Yeah, cut your losses for Spruce. Please leave me alone. This [ __ ] guy.
Yeah. I mean, why do quant firms not give equity partnerships? I mean, they do. If you're a co-founder,
this guy, do you think Citadel bought SPRB for the FDA approval play? What FDA
approval play? What are you talking about? When you buy a company stock, you're
buying it's kind of like you're buying a portion of the company. It's like a share of the company and the asset of
the company in the case of a drug company is a drug. And sometimes,
at least my experience, I buy shares of the drug companies when I look at the
drug and I think it's undervalued relative to what I'm paying for.
And that some people call investing.
I'm sure Kapper because the drug doesn't work.
That [ __ ] don't work.
I warned you [ __ ]
Yeah, she chiefs. They're the sheeps. Darn it.
Chiefs and schemes and
If you got your haircut like mine, I feel sorry for you.
Nvidia is really hard to to tell what's going to happen. I mean, in some ways, it's going to,
you know, it really depends on what this this super cycle looks like. But
and will the cycle end? You know, could it be a 20-year super cycle? It happened
to Intel.
Okay, Quantum is rallying here a little bit. Nvidia, you know, making all-time highs
$211 now.
Yeah, it could be could be fatty.
Yeah, I don't know why Nvidia's trying to sell the quantum because I think that quite frankly
quantum doesn't have the money to really help Nvidia too much. It's kind of a
They're not They're not big enough. I hate to say it.
That drug pharmacy dude, Martin, what's his name?
It's uh pretty pretty different uh to look at financials
on a terminal like Odell. You just do FA
also on Bloomberg. You can do CH1 and you can look at financials, but you
don't really that's not what a modeling is.
Everyone wants the shortcut. Who uh who once told Alexander the Great
there's no golden road in mathematics?
I think that's uh Uklid said there's no royal road to geometry.
To King Tome, not Alexander the Great. King Toll demanded from Uklid,
"Teach me geometry the easy way." Said, "Sir, sir, there's no golden road to
topology. China.
Guess I could trade around some positions. I hate doing this. Trading is
like a lot of times you when investors try to trade they they make things worse.
So, I have one short that's down a little bit and some other shorts that are up a little bit. I figure maybe I
can dart in and dart out like a like a bandit here, but I'm sure I'm going to
[ __ ] it up. Usually what happens is when I cover the short that I was shorting,
I shouldn't have covered it because it's actually going down fast. And when I try to reapply it to some of the other
trades I'm in, well, those trades, you know, they're up for a reason. They're they're they're working because
I don't know. They're uh What's up? No, I'm good for now. I ate earlier.
Thank you, man. So, let's see. Do I buy some puts or
let's see, maybe some puts on Brigetti? Brigetti is such a joke of a company,
man. They were featured yesterday.
I have Regetti 45 puts, which is a little
I made some money on those, it looks like.
Let me try. See here.
[Music]
I always like buying D-Wave puts. I got 40 puts, 39 puts,
38 puts. Stocks at 33. Might as well, I guess, buy 37 puts.
Any kind of short exposure to D-Wave is always smart. This company is like
the biggest clowns of all time. They didn't even get mentioned out of 17
companies on Jensen's screen. They couldn't get mentioned once. Come on,
bro. Who does that?
You couldn't even get a little shout out from Jensen. He's willing to shout out these shitty tiny companies you couldn't
even get a little little of from the Big Jay.
Come on, dude.
[Music]
Top news alert. Nvidia storms past $5
as AI boom powers meteoric rise. I have two two goodells open because I'm
doing some debugging and
whatnot.
Yeah, I'm trying to get the guys to agree to basically put the company on hold so we can play Rust
and um just start, you know, having monitors
all around the office. I don't know if you guys know this, but yeah, it's a
it's this like weird survival game where you build a base and you kind of like live in the base. And if you're like me,
you spend more time in the base than you do in real life.
So like it becomes your house. And uh the problem is if somebody tries
to raid you in like the middle of the night, you got to really be awake. Oh, there he is. Just telling these people
about Rust. I'm telling these people about how Rust
works.
Um, so
yeah, I love Rust and uh, so I was thinking about like getting
computer monitors all around the office and can we install cameras in
Rust and have them be the monitor?
But like if I had a a computer monitor right there and it was like our front door of our base, I can like have a view
of that. And then like
how about like can we make remake this office in Rust where like the screen
here and like this office was is in Rust.
Forget the time. just in general recreating this office in Rust where
everyone has like their their their seat. Yeah. And the monitor in real life is
like facing like I look at the monitor in real life and it's the same view,
you know, from like I can sit in my chair and like be like, "Okay, I can see that." And then I see outside the base
in case somebody's invading, you know?
maybe maybe spend more time building Godell stuff, but you know
there's Rust the programming language and then there's Rust the uh video game.
Problem with Rust the video games is very addictive. I I suggest you guys don't
don't get involved.
Yeah, it's nothing changed on Spruce. I just Well, I'm bidding for some. I think I got filled. I bet 119, so it must have
gotten filled. Pretty sure. Let's see.
Yes, I got filled. I can build for some more. I don't want to make it too much of a position. I
mean, I'm happy with the position I have. Just because a stock goes down in your
portfolio, you shouldn't be like, "Oh, I I'll have to buy more." You could also just wait.
Yeah, I got a couple good nights of sleep, but
we do some real analysis soon.
Yeah, basically Rust is like toxic [ __ ] Like, don't don't ever play it if you
can help it.
All right, let's do one of these. Let's do a Let's do a
poll.
This is the most toxic game ever. Ever.
All right, let's do a poll. Poll is up. Vote. Yeah, I kind of do want to look at
Fiser. I agree.
nonlo non-local cubit connectivity.
You guys familiar with the concept
[Music]
Sam Alman played Dota. I don't believe that.
Oh yeah, Xtropic is doing their thing today. Very excited about that.
Oh yeah, we got to do Biohaven. You want me to look at Google,
Google, and Nvidia? Toss up. Oh, Nvidia is now in the lead.
Yeah, KO2 is kind of bearish on Google for a while.
Trading momentum works pretty well as long as you have an itchy trigger finger to get out when it goes against you.
Yeah, Terraria, that sounds more right.
I can ask around. I'll get the answer.
Tyera Novo. All right, this is neck and neck in
video and Google. We can always go back to back, too.
Back and forth. Um,
yeah, really wild situation. Google's uh Nvidia's at one 5.1 trillion market cap
and enterprise value and that cash is 45 billion. We're going to look at their
uses of cash and stuff like that. Um, let me try something here.
Okay, just going to kind of use this sheet, which probably should be familiar to
some of you guys. Um, let me do like an earnings
section. Is this
Okay. Can we do like calendar year earnings per share? We'll do like I
guess 2020. I mean, we should do all the years theoretically.
2020. Let's just do 2025 forward. don't need to go to more detail
for now. Okay. And then we're going to do the same thing here with EV earnings, which
is kind of my favorite metric. Um, enterprise value divided by earnings
per share or enterprise value divided by sort of net income.
Let's try that. It's EV to E really. E to earnings, but net income and earnings
is the same thing. In college, I used to call it no PAT.
Net operating profits after tax. You still might hear that sometimes. So anyway, Nvidia's on a weird fiscal
versus calendar. So like theoretically they're if you add up all the quarters
um they have one more quarter report this year. So,
their earnings are 81 89. No, wait, wait. 89 96 105 125.
Um 96 105
125 142 that's 468. very confusing how to do this because
if I I want to include I could do the fiscal year too but I
think that's a little unfair because it sort of skews the numbers forward once. So we'll do the April quarter,
July quarter, October quarter and Jan quarter. I mean, I think that's the right balance,
but I'm not getting the numbers to add up to the numbers I have here. So,
okay, that's sort of right. It's very annoying.
That drug pharmacy dude. Martin, what's his name?
Okay, I think I I think this is it, but I'll just we'll see how it goes.
Now the calculation for EV to impute it from
EPS is a little tough because this is EPS. So I need to kind of manipulate it a little bit. I'm
going to do enterprise value divided by shares outstanding and then divide that by earnings per
share. But I need to do my order of operations
correctly here. Still got something wrong here. Let's see. Uh, yes. Number of zeros.
Maybe even more zeros. Maybe quite a lot of zeros it looks like. Um, because this is in full dollars and this is they have
24 billion shares outstanding.
We're going backwards. uh J4
divided by we have to make more PNS here.
Okay, there we go. 46 times this calendar year. But this calendar year is mostly over. So we don't really care
about this calendar year. We're going to freeze J. Freeze G
and let the rest go wild. So 32 years next calendar year. Um
I wonder if we should do revenue too just to you know
just to sort of have it.
So we'll do revenue um price to sales or EV to sales and
then I want to do revenue growth too.
We'll have to leave out the first year because we don't know what it is. Okay. Then we'll make little borders here.
Pretty little borders. It's not feel like Bob Ross. Happy little trees. Happy border right there.
It's not happy. Happy little border here.
not too too big into how these look, but you know, you got to be presentable at least.
And you can actually download this on my GitHub for free. So, so many people have
learned finance from me on Wall Street, it's not even funny. And that's why I'm still able to run a business on Wall
Street and still interact with people on Wall Street. I'm just very very blessed that many of you have my back and I
really appreciate that. You know, when somebody says something bad about me or something like that, you guys jump up
and say, "No, no, he did nothing wrong." And I I really do appreciate it. That's,
you know, I uh I won't I won't uh take that for granted. All right. So, the
street continues to raise numbers for Nvidia to the point where we're pretty
okay. EV divided by sales is going to be a little easier.
Oops. Like this. Oh, too many borders there. That's not happy border.
Again,
order of operations so important when you do these,
right? So, 26 times sales. Again, when you have a high margin product, price to sales tends to stop making sense.
So, just be wary of that. you know, sales or EV to sales in this case. You know,
it doesn't really always have to like that looks crazy 26 times sales, but when you remember the margins on the
product, you realize that oh, actually that's basically, you know, 50% net
margin. So, all right, let's freeze J. Leave Y.
And you can see the price to sales drops as the company expects some substantial growth there. Let's calculate said
growth. Let's make one happy border here. You know, none of this will really teach
you how to be an investment banker. Like that job is, you know, my my skill set
here and kind of what I what I teach you is more by stuff than sellsider. But
there are some other places you can go to if you really want to learn the nitty-gritty of how to make good Excels
and PowerPoints and stuff like that. Like on the buy side, that's a little less important. You know, we're we're mostly trying to make some money. All
right, so there's Nvidia's projected revenue growth. You can see
this is Wall Street consensus. doesn't always mean everything, but you can see the
39% projected growth, 22%, 7, and then 13, reaching about 400 billion in 2029.
I think they'll beat that. In fact, again, if you take Jensen at face value, he may do 400 in 2026.
Okay, 2026. the street has them doing 400
in 2029. Can you imagine? Now, the problem isn't the problem with Nvidia
isn't uh are they doing well? We all know that the problem is
what's the sustainability, right? That's the main issue. Are they going to be
able to actually sustain this for for time, you know, time of memorial? And I think, you know,
one of the things I want to look at here is is actually, believe it or not, Intel.
Um, now I do want to shout out Semi analysis, who's got some really great
semiconductor stuff. If you really serious about semiconductors, you got to read Semi analysis. It's worth its
weight in gold. Um, it's very cheap, actually. They could be charging
100x what they charge. And in fact, I think you can read it for free, which is crazy. So, this is Dylan Patel
and his group. Um, and they're just there's no contest. You know, in the
past, you would want to read um, and I'm not being paid by them. I'm not
partnered with them. I have no I'm just calling a spade a spade. You know, you'd want to talk to guys in Asia. You'd want
to talk to the big banks on Wall Street. At this point, I mean, they really have
the game unlock. So, we'll probably read some semi analysis. I'm probably going to try to spend an hour on Nvidia if
that's if that works for you. Um, now again, you know, when we look at
DCFS, we're we're trying to understand what this is the most important thing to any
DCF. Okay, this the most important thing in investing really is what is the
steady state earnings and way how do you define steady state?
Well, the way the way I the reason I call it that is that many companies are not in a steady state and some
companies by definition will never be in a steady state and some people call instead of steady state you call maturity
you know the matter has some interesting definitions of of this you know what's a
company at maturity what's the growth at maturity and so forth but you know when you have a company that's the products
are are planned obsolescence right this is the V100 this is the A100 00. This is
the H100. This is the B100. You know, not exactly drawn a scale, but you know,
maybe it's something like like they like Yeah, like this,
you know. And so V100, A100. These are Nvidia chips for anybody that doesn't know the lingo. These are the H100's.
This is the B200. And then we have Reuben coming, which we don't know. Maybe maybe Reuben's like this, right?
And so you have this like platin obsoles and so what's steady state doesn't make sense here. Whereas for Coca-Cola or
something like that it's a lot easier to value because
you can sort of say that you know
you know the company you know started had a big growth spurt and you know revenue sort of reached this sort of
steady plateau you know of of small growth and maybe one day we'll have some
decline. We can sort of model this. This is a in calculus this is called the area under the curve right we can just say
well what's that right what's that a what's the discounted AU of those cash
flows here you have something a little different it's it's a cyclicality that you have to understand and the
cyclicality is not just the product cycle it's the business cycle right so you have a bunch of different things
there and you have a technology cycle now that's you know a little bit difficult to understand and we're going
to try to figure this out, but it's not going to be easy. And it requires some creative thinking. And in some ways,
investing is a little like philosophy where we don't really know where we're going. And and part part of it was we
were trying to scope that out and figure out what to do. Checking back on the market, we got a
little bit of a rally in our hated uh quantum sector here. So, I actually want
to look at for a long-term perspective here, I kind of want to look at Intel, and I want to go back really far back in
time for Intel. Um,
what the Okay, Intel stock price has changed
quite a bit since I last looked at it. We were we were relatively bullish on it, so I hope you know somebody made
some money. much higher market cap than it was once
was. Rockets up the list from 140 largest market cap to say 61.
Good for Intel.
They have some net debt. So the enterprise value of the company is actually a little bit higher.
17 in net debt. So, it's actually 194 billion.
Um, I'm gonna move this. Actually, I can delete that now.
I might leave it for now, but let me see if I can
Yeah, Nvidia's success is incredible. All right. So on Intel, what I'm really trying to figure out is, you know, I
think for Intel and Micron, I want to look at the semiconductor cycle. And this is something that has sort of sort
of doesn't exist anymore for Nvidia. And that's where I kind of want to make sure that we're we haven't made the
awful mistake of of which happens in finance sometimes. It's basically one of the biggest mistakes you can make, which
is you mistake cyclicality for permanent growth. And I don't want to do that. I know you don't want to do that. So,
we're going to try to figure that out. Um, we haven't looked at Intel in a while. We kind of saw it as this kind of
boring value stock that probably had some upside. They obviously had sort of a really really big
W or two. I'm going to close Nvidia for now, believe it or not. Even though we're looking at Nvidia, we I what I
really want to do is understand long-term semicles. And I'm going to go back in time. And I'm also going to do the same thing for
Micron. And this can be a little tedious, but you know, learning the history of of
your business is so important. Every time I talk to guys, I'll give you another example. You know, in bioarma, I
kind of became like the one of the most well-known guys in bioarma and one of the sharpest before the farmer bro
[ __ ] because I I kind of tried to learn every company in bioharma history,
including companies that had long been gone. And I did a um
I did a funny analysis. I don't know if I have the file on me,
but I did a historical bioarma, you know, let me see if I have it because it's so interesting. I think
give you an example of of of the links you have to go through
to to really claim you understand your industry. I mean, you have to eat, breathe, and sleep it all the time. Here
it is. Ah, I found it. Great. So, this tracks every pharma merger from 1849
to modern time. And so, these are all the companies that merged into Fizer to create Fizer.
William R. Warner and company. This became Warner Lambert through the
merger of Lam Lambert Pharmarmacal Company that became Warner Lambert. So,
William R. Warner company was founded in 1856. Lampert wasn't founded until 1881, but
eventually they merged long time from now. They renamed uh Warner L Warner
William Warner company Warner Hudnut and they merged in 1956 to create Warner Lampert.
Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anybody, American Home Products was founded in
1860. John Wyth and his brother John and Frank Wyth were founded founded that company
in Philadelphia and Arist McKenna and Harrison Limited
was founded in 1925. American Home Products merged
uh with Wyth by just buying um Wyth Stewart Wire Stuart W Stewart
Wyth who was John Wyth's son or brother his son died left Wyth to Harvard of all
places Harvard sold American Home products to Wyth or Wyth to American
Home products creating the bigger AHP P. Now, if you've been around the industry,
HP was still public around 99200. I used to trade HP. So, this is 1931.
Uh, and there's AIST. Uh, American Home Products acquired AIST 1943. So, 1944,
you have really big American Home Products. We're going to put that on hold for now. And again, the point is
like slowly but surely, Warner Lambert was public. it was WLA. Um Fizer, if you notice, Fiser is this
little tiny guy in 1849, right? And all these other big companies are being created around Fizer.
So Fiser is doing much just about nothing. And then finally the Fiser Warner
Lampert merger in 2000 creates a major major company. But pharmarmacia was
already, you know, kind of developing and American products was developing. So
the big deal in 2004 was Fizer buying pharmace
and American home products uh was still public changed his name to Wyth of course and then the monster deal to
decide whether Trump legally deployed troops to Portland. So Viser kept acquiring little companies
like Medavivation Arena Biohaven Seattle Genetics and that's where we're at in 2025.
Um, I have a few more of these to make, but the point is knowing your industry's
history is something that's important. I also know the drugs that these companies made. You know, Warner Lambert was
actually the inventor of Lipur. And if you know, the more history you know, when you meet people, if you know the
people behind it, it's obviously not important to know the people from 1850. But who was the CEO of Warner Lampert?
Is he on any boards right now? Is he giving any talks? Maybe he can go to a talk. And you know the CEO of Warner
Lamper talk is going to have eight people attending it whereas the CEO of Fizer talk is going to have 300 people
attending it at your local college. But you can probably you know get a word in with the guy who was the CEO of Warner
Lampert um if he visits your college. Um so the point is you know knowing all
these names actually makes it you know a lot easier to network and when you bump
into somebody it helps. So Intel it's no different in any SEC sector. So in in financial technology which I'm somewhat
new to. I'm a financial technology startup that that uh
you know I've been studying the the how S&P Global for example was made through mergers from McGraill and you know was a
very fascinating thing how S&P Global became what's basically the largest fintech in the world now bigger than even Bloomberg. Um so knowing the
history of all that's I think you know really really helpful and important. Um, so let's see if we can get the revenue
from Intel from as far back basically as we can go. And
I just want to see kind of how Intel navigated this like cyclical growth
thing um that happened to them because it sort of feels like in some ways the
same thing here just a much bigger obviously you know inflation adjusted and and in
other ways it's a much bigger
it's a much bigger kind of situation. So,
let me see if I can get
the 10K we're missing, which is 20 2005.
And again, you know, it's it's this is all really helpful if you're going to if you're going to make your name as a pharma or biotech or semiconductor
analyst, like you should know approximately what was the size of Intel in 2005,
what what was the clock speed around that time? What was the wafer size? What was the you know the etch size, the
technology size, how big was the transistor at the time? Where did they make it? you know, all of those things, you know, you should you should
understand and and know your history. Now, it's more important, you know, the present details, right? But, uh, you
know, don't don't skip out on the history because that's one, you know, it tends to repeat itself. And then two,
you know, we no man as an island. I mean, you have to meet people, shake
their hands, get to make contacts, be friendly. Uh and and when you share your
insights, you know, people say, "Well, that guy that guy really knows his stuff. You know, he needs a haircut, but
he he's good at that." Um and that's the kind of thing that, you know, will will
benefit you greatly. So, study your study your industry as hard as you can
and you will I guarantee you you'll you'll make some success. All right.
Now, Intel, like a lot of other companies, spent a lot of cash buying buying back shares instead of buying other companies. You know, Intel reduced
their share count here from, you know, 5 billion or 6 billion, 6.5 billion to
four billion. Well, that's great for the shareholder, but they much rather would have bought of Nvidia,
right? You know, and they don't have to buy all of Nvidia. Yeah, I mean this is the funny thing. Companies really are dumb
when it comes to this stuff. I think corporate America has this terrible disease where they don't understand that like you can buy unsolicited 5 10% 15
20% of a company. Nothing stopping you. Nothing stopping you. There's a company
you admire in in the se in the sector, buy 10% of it. What's the big deal? You
know, but the there's this frustration that, you know, most CEOs don't know how
to invest and they don't want to learn how to invest and they don't trust anybody else to invest and the boards are no good about it either. And it
feels like, you know, what it it's not the real core use of cash in the first place. So, why, you know, why do that?
Well, what's a buyback? What the hell is a buyback? You know, buyback is just a taxfree dividend. Um,
and we're going to see if we can put Nvidia's plot and videos revenue on onto this as
well. But let's go down to 2002. Now,
we're going to see what years there was some. I'm going to probably put them in
gray or something. I don't know. Let's try that. Light light yellow,
light red. I don't know. Some cyclicality here.
Let's keep going.
There's also a time when these okay companies stopped reporting their annuals in the form 10K and actually had
a an extra attachment somewhere else. Okay, so here is another big cyclical
period. This was the period I remember very fondly um because it was really disastrous
and probably set the stage in many ways for Nvidia's ascent. It began the ascent
of Nvidia. They were obviously unrelated but you know Nvidia was kind of lying and wait here and probably the
distraction of this big big cyclical drop where you know people were really
scared. I mean there was a question of how how far back would we backslide
um economically and you know when would the the pain end you know everyone was talking about the hard landing soft
landing B-shaped recovery you know uh people worried it was going to be L
recovery no recovery just drop and stay down there so you know it was a bad time
at the time it's really not great and you know fear tends to
pervade you know in times like that. Um, Intel was really profitable in 2000, but
it was also the beginning of the end in 2000. Um, all right. So, let's keep going
here.
And again, you know, they had 7 billion shares outstanding. They decided they wanted to,
you know, use all this cash. I mean, every year 8 billion, 4 billion, 4 billion, 7 billion, 8 billion, 8
billion, 3 billion, 6 billion, 7 billion, 5 billion, 11 billion, 12 billion. What they do with any of this
cash? Nothing. They bought back their shares at prices that were way too high
that would end up dropping. You know, you buy back your stock if you think it's cheap, but what the hell do
you know about investing? If you knew anything about investing, you would have bought Nvidia stock. So, you know, it's
just kind of this, you know, corporate America is terrible at strategy and mergers and
acquisitions. And sometimes, you know, you'll get a CEO who's really good and they'll they'll actually deliver the
goods. Um, and they're they're just brilliant and they know how to do both. But, you know,
investing traditionally is is, you know, one thing, but then deciding, okay, this is a great company, I want to have a
part of it, that's kind of a different job altogether. So, look at the the big boom here. This was like massive boom
time. Look at the revenue. Um, oh wait, hold on. I have the
This was a big boom time. Um, but revenue jumped from 25 to 33 before cratering a
bit. 2570 26 273 29 389
and then again you had this uh big decline.
See if I get rid of this.
Um but that was a big stretch. I think there there was another cyclical period in 94.
But let me let me fill these out real quick. Take two seconds.
And there was a split. Stock splits were also invogue at the
time. Americans wanted cheap shares.
Nobody wanted a $1,000 share. Now it's the opposite.
And again, you know, 7.2 billion shares outstanding all the way down to 4 billion. You know, huge waste of
capital. But again, a company had no no idea what to do with with the rest of their money.
They could have gone into semi they could have gone to foundry. They could have gone into manufacturing equipment. They could have gone into anything. But
what they did did, which is, you know, take their stock and buy buy back
shares. Yeah, it's real real cringe stuff.
But again, easy to say with hindsight, right? Easy to say, oh yeah, you know
what? What I would have done was this. Well, you know,
you're not Andy Grove, I guess.
Who were the CEOs of and uh Intel in Andy Grove? Craig Barrett that comes to
mind. Does anyone remember that name? Um sort of different tenures.
All right. So here here was the mega the mega mega growth. So 20% growth there.
So this is kind of analogous to maybe what Nvidia is going through now. this period, the 90s, but I want to go back
even further. So, yeah, here's the 40% 20% 29% 20%. This is Windows 95
dominance revenue grows from 11 billion to 33 or 34 billion. Now, we know that
Nvidia did way more than that, right? So, we're going to see if we can, no pun intended, parallelize
Intel makes uh Nvidia makes parallel processors. parallelize this a little bit and see if we can find some uh
interesting parallels. But the there's actually a a term in data sort of um
engineering where you're trying to see if I get the split amount. I think
it was maybe eight for one where you're trying to get um
time series to fit over each other and you like adjust them slightly so that
like pauses or delays in those time series can get sort of swallowed up and
re recreated. Um all right so 96
It's probably eight for one,
you know. And it's funny, they they did better when they weren't buying back stock. When they're letting their share
count grow, buybacks are kind of contrary indicators, you know, they're doing buybacks. Well,
that was the that was the the top cuz when you got nothing to do with your stock and you're not growing fast,
buybacks are kind of like, oh, again, very very cringe. I mean, you're
buying you're buying back your stock at the height of your success. What do you think's going to happen?
Um, and it may look smart in a few years, but is does it look smart in 10 years?
Does it look smart in 20 years? That's kind of what matters. And that's where I think I want to really understand where
where Nvidia is going here because and it's not easy, right? It's not like this is going to give us the answer. This is
going to give us a clue if we're lucky. So, we got a wrong number here. 406 415
273. Okay.
Got it. All right. Let me double check this split. It must have been eight for one, but I just want to There was a two
for one. Another two for one.
I don't know. I'm just going to assume that was it. The numbers add up, so
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. Two two for ones.
I don't know. It has to be right.
Uh let's go back to 93. I am uh
10 years old. So, I'm reading gaming magazines, PC
magazines, and things like that, but I don't really know what the hell is going on.
And Intel, a much younger company here at just 8 billion in revenue. And look
at this. Look at this. This really does maybe remind of Nvidia cuz let's just uh
do this for a second while we flip these out. So 91 92
you know Intel in essence is growing like a weed. So 20% 22% 50% 31 41 29 20
six years in a row of massive you know massive growth. So maybe I'll
type color that light green. Then you do have this slowdown here right 98 there
was some there was a stock market crash in essence. Uh even in 94 there was some Asian
contasion but that wasn't didn't stop Intel. and 99
2000 the growth was again double digits
and it's good to save these because I mean once you've done it once you have it forever if you ever want to look at
AMD you know you can kind of get a sense from the AMD Intel wars of your
okay and here is another split so 16 shares go 16x
Incredible what splits can do.
And again, the share counts going up, not going down. They're not buying back shares. They they're letting the options
grants dominate. And you know, company thinks that, oh, well, you know, once we have
tons of cash, we can buy back those options. But it's like actually better off just issuing lots more. getting your
workforce organized and excited about the next thing you can do. Intel wisely
always avoided quantum by the way. Have a small quantum group, but they always were suspicious of quantum, which
it's the one thing they did, right? But they, you know, they they they they got into a ton of missteps. They kind of got
into Ethernet networking and that never became really big for them. And we all know Intel's missteps. And it's easy
again to say in hindsight what happened, what went wrong.
All right, so we have all the way back to 94 here. It's going to be a little tricky to get maybe more.
We'll try.
My databases aren't exactly cooperating, but I think I can do it.
Might have to go to the microfilm for this one.
All right.
That's odd.
Internet's your friend, right? You could just search
until 1990 10K. Ah, Intel has a historical archive on
their website that goes back.
It's kind of memory lane.
This is the This is what you used to do. And the college I went to, we had a reading room of all these old annual
reports. So you you'd go find them there or something like that.
Bob, one of the treacherous eight or treacherous seven, what was it? There's
Craig Barrett and Andy Grove. I don't know microprocessor lore, but
there was the Fairchild
32-bit systems.
Okay, here's our income statement. All right. So,
again, some lovely growth here in the 90s, early uh
80s or early 90s, late 80s.
Again, kind of reminiscent of Nvidia's scale scale differently. I mean that is zero I guess cuz the world economy was
just less mature at the time.
What am I doing here? I'm missing uh a year. There we go.
And now we have to scale the shares outstanding by 32. They split so much that got 32 uh%
32x excuse me shares outstanding growth. So
you know buybacks in the scheme of things didn't even dent those in a way.
And now you see shares outstanding kind of growing rapidly instead of shrinking rapidly. It's very telling
that, you know, you had this dilution that occurred as they grew so fast and their employees, you know, got got all
these stock options that no doubt, you know, there were many Intel millionaires made. You know, if you were walking
around Silicon Valley and so I was at Intel, you know, I'm a senior guy at
Intel. I was there for the 10 last 10 years. People would say that guy's got to be rich, doing real well. Now you you
say something like that and you say, "Poor guy." Feel bad for you, Bal.
Um, they got a boatload of worthless Intel
stock options. All right. So, two more 20 20% years.
So, basically, Intel had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 eight 20% plus
growth years, including a 50 and a 40, but 89 was was was a little slow. And
again, when you're growing that fast, just growing 9% is actually kind of I
would say that's a cyclical downturn. But let's let's look at 87. Intel goes back far. I mean, this is the company that made the microprocessor. So, we got
more and more and more to go.
It won't be too long if you can't wait. Cover photo. If you can't If you can't wait, you have ADHD. Investing takes a
while. Intel's most advanced microprocessor, the 80 386. This is a
386, you know, 1987. I was four years old. I
was playing on Apple 2E maybe, but not this. 275,000 transistors. There's trillions of transistors now. Capable of
running Dawson Unix simultaneously. Woo. It also takes advantage of software
developed for the 86 series. Major growth at this era, too. And
here's actually in some ways all that we want right here. So maybe we can I hate to
cut this short, but I know a lot of people have ADHD, so let's just
This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy. It's crazy. All right. 1265
1365 1629. This is what it takes to be good in my opinion. 11:22
U now this is the Intel's first billion dollar year.
789 855. Here's a period of very slow growth there.
And again, it's some of this is product and some of it is the economy.
All right. So, 51% growth that year. And some of it is ship shipments and stuff
like that. I mean, but you can see here there was some serious slowdowns
here. There was the 8586. What happened in 8586?
Anybody remember? H
was that the crash?
Is that the 84 crash?
Okay. So, you know, Intel, you know, this this is sort of reminiscent of Nvidia, right? Growing from 400 in
revenue to 4 billion. That took 13 years and then 4 billion to 40 billion.
Maybe a little less successful than Nvidia, but still uh meteoric kind of success. Some years,
early years, they're going up 60%. And again, we we're not done. There were microprocessors. Well, this is around
the time Intel got founded. We're getting pretty close to the start of the company.
So, see how they they overlap. It'll be kind of interesting at least. Um, it was the first product, the 8086
or 8088 or
40. No, no, 4044, something like that. I forgot what it was called. Let's Let's
check out this guy
and and see if you think this matches what quantum looked like
large scale integrated circuits. Okay. Yeah. Here's all the the rest we
need here. So 78
1969 600,000 in revenue. Um,
okay. Let's see if we can overlap in video here somewhere. Ah, there we go.
There's a few ways to do this, but let me do it
this way.
Okay, I have to go back in time more for Nvidia or let's see if I can get Nvidia's
99 fiscal or 2009 uh 99 1999
video 1999 and report 10K. Well, that's just on
sec.gov. 99 Jensen Wang, 39 years old. Marvin
Burrat 60. One of their CFOs went to jail. I don't know if it was him or not, but you
know, it's funny. Do you do you know any of these people? Does anybody ever heard of any of these people? Jeffrey Fischer, David Shannon, Dimma,
you know, it's a very interesting point that uh
whom amongst us remembers these. Okay. 99 they did 158.
Just gonna leave that there9 fiscal year 99. Let me see if I can get
fiscal 98.
Nope.
H. Well, maybe maybe this will give me revenue if I look far back enough. No, I
don't think so.
Xbox was a big product, I guess.
Do they go public then?
Try sec.gov. See what happens.
CC.go is a little busted right now actually.
10 Q but not 10k. What the [ __ ]
Okay, there's the S1 for Nvidia. That might have the details. Uh, S8, maybe
first S1. This will be fun to read.
The head of Wilson Canci was still Larry Cini. It's a big law firm. They're raising 40
million. Can you imagine? That's that's a seed round today.
Nvidia Designs the Reva 128 graphics processor. I'm
going to throw that in my model just in case I ever meet an old Nvidia guy and say, "Do you know what the Reva 128 was?
Was that any good?" Let's see. What was this? 2000 1996
8 March 698 1998.
Uh, well, I guess they reinccorporate Delaware filed IPO Reva 128 product.
Wonder how many transistors that had or if it was doing parallel processing.
Okay. Okay. Here it is from dawn
of the company.
Oh, they had uh they had normal fiscal years back then. H didn't know that.
So, h okay, let me see. Well, we should be able to recreate the whole thing. I
don't know when they went to a bizarre fiscal year, but 1231.
1997,
3 million in revenue there. 1 million in revenue there.
Fiscal year 96. Fiscal year 95. 123196. 123195.
Okay, the first Okay, here's a 10K 10K 405.
Sometimes they had these weird appendages.
Then I had the Reva TNT. I do I I kind of remember this thing
kind of accelerated graphics port.
Okay, it says invention of the GPU 1999. I don't know if that's right, but
regardless
Revala 128 ZX. I wonder if you could find one of these
on on eBay. Somebody can find one of those on eBay, maybe send it over to me. I'll buy it and frame it.
SGI. Everyone in Silicon Valley should know what SGI was. Wow. January 31st, 1999,
we had 248 employees. Jesus. Can you imagine?
Imagine quitting. I don't like this. Making video games. It's silly. Jensen
Wong 36. O to be 36. Chris Malachowski. What's he doing right
now? What's Chris Malachowski doing right now? Let's take a look. Boss, you're American electric engineer
and billionaire businessman. Oh, this is Wasn't this the guy that invented CUDA?
Isn't this the CUDA guy?
He co-founded Nvidia 93. Okay, write his name down.
Isn't he Mr. Cuda?
co-founder.
Okay, let's take a look at who else. Christine Hobberg.
Oops.
Oh, this is the Oh, this is this lady stepped in [ __ ]
How many How many other CFOs got charged with [ __ ] Like I think this is two two
or three times Nvidia was lagging behind expectations. In order to meet those expectations,
they entered into agreement with supplier.
Yesesh, sucks that she's known now known for
this, right?
Okay. Jeff Fischer,
senior vice president in video. Jesus, look at this. Look at this guy.
Experience senior vice president 31 years. This guy's still there.
Director of sales. He was at Adapt Tech. Really funny.
The hell? No photo. Just can I follow him? Maybe.
Can maybe see if he Maybe he'll connect. Who knows? You never know, right? Nvidia's first
salesperson. And there he is. Had any products.
At the time, Nvidia employed 25 people. So technically, he's employee 26, right?
And again, these people are still alive. You can call them up. You can find them. They're not, you know, I'm sure some of
them are friendly. Don't go knock on their door.
Mark Allen.
This guy's unknown. Unknown.
It's got just a generic such a generic name. That's Englewood, Colorado. Is this the guy?
Okay. No, that's definitely not him. I think this is him.
Maybe this Nvidia Auditorium, but it's not
him.
This guy was disappeared from the internet.
Mark K. Allen. Hey, was that CC cube? Okay, that maybe we'll look for that.
CQ cube micro systemystems that'll tell us.
Okay, this is interesting.
There he is. That looks more like somebody that was at Nvidia in the 90s. Okay. He he joined Kleiner Perkins.
Oh, he was Transmeta. Okay. Did he start Transmeta? I remember Transmet Meta vaguely.
He left Nvidia for Transmeta. Big mistake. But Transmeta has its own history.
And he became CEO of Transmeta. He still would have been better off staying at Nvidia. Mark Allen left to become CEO of
Trans Meta.
Curtis Supreme
co-founded Nvidia as well. So he would have been employee number two.
You're starting a hedge fund. These are the guys to call. Here it is. Sup Pounder.
[Music] left the company in 2003, sold all his shares in 2006. RIP.
Ow. He was a senior staff engineer at Sun
where he developed the GX graphics strip. Sun and SGI were, I guess, the two main guys. Retired in 2003. Got it.
Net worth. Oh, Jesus Christ. Forbes estimated Prim's net worth to be approximately 30 million. Not bad. If he
had retained his shares in Nvidia, Forbes estimated premium would have been worth 70 billion.
[Music] Well, in 2004, he he donated 40 million
to the institute uh to his old college, the RPI. So, I think he I think he's all
right. I think he's all right.
[Music] Don't sell.
Why? Okay. Month end. What is this? Month ended January 1st, 1998. Why are you
reporting a month of revenue for me? Why do you do this?
Can you have you guys ever seen this in a financial statement? This is why their financial they they should go to jail for this. Month ended 1998. I'm sure
Nvidia CFOs are nice people, but what the f is this? Month ended. Month ended.
Like I give a [ __ ] what December revenue was. I just want to know
what 98 revenue was. And I can I can just make it up. You know what? They made up numbers. I'll
make up the numbers. How about that? Now there's there should be a January
full year here.
I love these old asy asy 10ks. They're pretty funny.
But yeah, one of the I mean I really love doing research into the starts of companies. I've been doing this for a long time. Um,
I look at the the first people who were at Google and OpenAI and other companies. It doesn't have to just be,
"Oh my god, they still do the month end down here." I mean, this is not enough to make you scream
one month of revenue. This is a joke, right? You're you're trolling me, right?
I might have to impute it. I hate to do this, but might have to be imputed. You know what?
There's also GPT. GPT is a pretty good search engine.
Nvidia 1998 revenue.
Nope. Okay. No, that's that's not right.
I have that.
What was Nvidia's revenue and fiscal year 1998?
No. How about the year prior to that?
Uh 133.
Did it go down? I guess it went down. And the year prior to that,
I mean, it could have just gone down. Couldn't locate it, right? Neither can
I.
I can't find it. Do you want me to dig? Yes, I want you to dig. Of course. That's exactly what I'm asking you to
do. All right, let me check this out.
All right, maybe we just leave it at that. Okay, now what do we do with this? We're
going to take this and we're going to stagger it over Intel's start.
We'll see. who did better and we'll also see
how do we think about it from an inflationary perspective. Do we adjust? I think we would have to
adjust for inflation which we can do fairly easily. We can do
a dollar value.
What was the value of a dollar
in 1969 to annually
from 1969 to 1979?
Okay. 30 adjustment factors 3668. Wait.
Should it go the other way? $23.
Okay, this makes a little more sense. 880 830
790 770 730 666
570 530 497 446 393
Nope. This time
This is eerie.
and you can imagine this these metrics would actually be useful for other comparisons you might make in the past.
So this year this is n 134.97 for okay so this year
be 197 220
and people are estimating call it 300 for next year really
although that number 300 even 300 is going to be too small I
So technically Intel still kind of outperformed Nvidia,
but let's see. Oh, well up until here. And then Nvidia takes off like a rocket
and then there's no contest. I'll show you the chart in a second. Um,
this is going to be an interesting tweet.
Missed one. Let's see. 183 178 72 16560
This is kind of extrapolated as well.
There's a lot of inflation recently.
Okay.
Helpful.
need the log chart
probably right. How do we do log chart? Anybody know
scale?
There we go. Wow. Wow. Crazy. Look at that. You guys see this?
The [ __ ] That is nuts.
That is nuts. My intuition was really
really interesting. Right.
How [ __ ] crazy is that?
This is a masterpiece.
I mean now the problem is what what can we infer? Nothing.
Did we not adjust? No, we don't have to adjust. Um,
do we have to adjust Nvidia for inflation?
I still like it. This is a really good fit.
The fit's too good.
Okay, let me see.
Yeah, it wasn't. I guess I just have to calculate the
hosted anyway. No, let's let's uh calculate the lag.
So, Intel's first year is 1969. So, we we do change it to today's
dollars. So, um we just have to do how many years was
that? 95. Okay. I think it's going to stay roughly the same relationship, by the way. But,
so this is 69 verse 95. So this is 26 year delay.
I made it up. I try not to do that after, you know,
prison, you know, just kind of try to chill.
Good thing is I can take all the we already have all the data. So I can go to
Nvidia's first year which again is 95. Copy pasta this. Yeah, it's going to
mostly be the same.
My my lawyer was joking with my prosecutor, which I didn't like, that
he's like, "Martin's the most honest fraudster you'll ever meet." And the prosecutor's like, "You're right." Actually, I'm like, "This fraud [ __ ]
[ __ ]
Okay, barely changed it.
You adjusted I did I I just adjusted it for inflation to the
Yeah, I guess if you do the you need you still need the first 24 years of inflation that they didn't
overlap after that you don't have to adjust anymore.
There's just one problem. CPI is fake.
Well, that's true. That's true. Actually, if you remove the last value, you could argue that
it's it's not going to be much much higher. But I do think that they are going to meet that value. I mean, Jensen
said they have five billion and
I guess I should have started it with zero
as well for that last one little line.
I like that. Which one is Intel? Which one is Nvidia? Well, take a wild guess.
There's one chart that's breaking out a bit really fast and ends after,
you know, um, 1999 because it's a younger company.
Yeah, something like that. Cuda
Do I block this guy for
I got to block some of these idiots.
What the [ __ ] Pop news alert. Boeing takes near $5 billion hit on much delayed 777X
program.
Label your access dog. They're labeled.
They're literally labeled.
I hate stupid people, man.
So, you know, in some ways this is kind of bullish because it it sort of shows
that Intel was able to do just fine for 25 years after plateauing.
Never had a big drop, right? Plenty of competition for Intel. Never
had this big fat, you know, drop.
I just want to ban as many dumb people as possible. This is a good test for that.
data series labeled. There's nothing to label you, [ __ ] There's two [ __ ]
lines, bro. You don't have your data series
labeled. One is Nvidia, the other is Intel.
Do you need more help?
What chart crime? What the [ __ ] are you talking about?
It's chart crime for for the down syndrome patient.
Do you though? Yeah, I'll do me. I I'm the millionaire investor who's world famous. You are
I don't know some guy.
Make a box with a key of the two lines that are labeled already.
I think it's interesting that they tracked closely for 30 years. That's that's crazy.
Okay. Well, how many millions do you have? Bet you have got more.
I just can't say the B one yet.
Yeah. The chart.
The chart. Yeah, the chart properties. Some of you guys are are have been doing too much investment banking. The chart
properties are not quite important.
What's important is the insight.
I mean, if you're too stupid to understand it, you don't believe I mean, you shouldn't be investing. Just go away. This is not what we do.
It's not our job. Our job is to develop insights and make money. Maybe your job is to make presentations for people, but
that's not my job.
Yes, I'm short a whole lot of quum and it's not going down.
But but but but Look at that BTQ. BTQ is going down.
Should adjust some positions here.
[Music]
Joby. Look at Joby. Spy is barely up. Quantum rallying.
I got something for you. Don't worry.
Shorty more D-Wave here. Their quarter is going to be smaller
than Miss Kim's laundromat. We're going to be take it live to Miss Kim.
Miss Kim. Miss Kim, good catch up with you. How was your Q3? Better or worse than D-Wave.
I just need an actual Miss Kim who will do the acting.
What you want? [ __ ] scray. [ __ ] you.
Why you bother me? Just want to compare you to Quantum.
And then she says some [ __ ] in Korean, like, you know, some wild [ __ ] talk in
Korean. Oh yeah, I got to get some IQ options here. Let me do the 70s or
something like that.
[Music]
beetti.
Yeah, maybe we're getting as well.
Oh, capper rising. Got to see. Gotta love that capper coming real soon.
Like to see that. Need a higher price there. It's always
nice to get a little higher priced.
Whole lot of meetings for this afternoon. I also want to do some work on Nvidia's
actual products. Where are we going? What does the economy need them? What does semiconductors kind of do for the
economy? There's a whole bunch of questions we can we can ask.
Fake Twitter bots, man. They're everywhere.
One guy said I was NSA.
I'm cold.
That drug pharmacy dude, Martin, what's his name? Markelli.
That's Joe Rogan and the Rizza. Maybe. Is that them?
Abby vax almost 100. Let's go.
Okay, I'm actually super cold right now.
to move to a new office. This place is too cold.
Ah, this is the guy I got to call. Got a busy schedule today.
and I'm reasoning. Stop.
I'm not short NASDAQ though. But yeah, Nvidia's come down a bit here.
See what else comes down.
probably short inflection too. CCCX. Wow, Aqua's up 8%. Joby's up 9%. These
things are flying.
Go figure.
drug don't work.
All the quantums are pretty bad. None of them have any really redeeming
qualities. DW is probably the worst. I mean,
I can do more ion Q. Kind of went a little ham on regetti.
Ion Q is kind of pretty good one.
ion Q is kind of trying to like change the game with quantum sensing which is
kind of a completely unrelated technology but it has the word quantum in it. So they they
are confusing complete idiots into thinking that they have this like end to end quantum system
when there's no such thing. Quantum isn't really an end to end
thing. Doesn't make any sense.

We should be able to give you all the coverage.
from earning season.
It's amazing. Nvidia and Microsoft 32 times earnings next year. It's a little pricey
for for Microsoft, but Microsoft has been growing nicely.
As of now, the street doesn't have Nvidia surpassing Microsoft, but
that can change. And Microsoft revenue growth scheduled
for 14% a year for the next four or five years. That seems aggressive.
Never say never. That seems aggressive. Mid- teens growth for Microsoft for four
years. It's such a big company. It's so hard to grow.
Is Office going to grow 14% a year. Is Xbox, Surface, LinkedIn? I mean,
it's a tough one. I wouldn't want to be Satia, but 32 times isn't,
you know, it could be it could be softer than that. That'll be fine. That's uh
big number.
know they are getting a lot from open AI to some extent. So that's the passive investment as well. All right. So we're
expecting 75 five that's quarter
which is 15% growth.
and 822 next quarter
which is also 15ish% growth.

Next quarter 383.
That'll be interesting.

Alphabet guiding capex. See if Nvidia moves off that.
Wait, is that right? 2025 capex 91 to 93. That's more than before now.
Yeah, it was 75 to 85. Now they're moving to 90 1 to 93. That's almost 20. Wow, that's
good for Nvidia. It's almost 20 billion 15 billion increase in capex.
I suppose that's why Nvidia is so confident now is it? Okay, it's about 8 billion increase. It looks like 7

will be the most exciting period in our history.
metaverse is a little behind schedule, but we're going to need these investments in AI to make sure that when
we do deliver the metaverse that it's better than

Yeah, I don't know. Meta seems like it could come back a little bit price-wise. I mean,
it's not the first time their spending scared people. Okay, here's their explanation of spending.

Smoked
meats are actually more important to me than Facebook. Sorry, I can't say with a straight face.
Brisket
glorified ad sellings company. It's an ad selling company. Nobody Nobody cares
about that.
Just finished smoking an incredible brisket. 14 hours.
Hey Mark. Um, yeah. I just wanted to talk about your Q3 earnings.
Oh man, those earnings were wild. But honestly, I'm way more pumped about this new dry rub recipe I cracked. We beat
expectations, but the real win is I'm launching Beyond Meat Smokers across all Facebook cafeterias. What's got you
interested in the numbers? Well, you know, I'm just a trader. I'm trying to figure out, you know, if the stock's going to go up or down, but you
seem to be more focused on freaking meat.
Zuck. Hello.
I get it. You're trying to read the tea leaves on the on the stock move. But here's the thing. While everyone else is
obsessing over ad revenue, I'm building the future of sustainable protein delivery on our platform. That's where
the real long-term value sits.
What? Look, while Wall Street's obsessing over daily ad clicks, I'm building a future
where every Facebook employee crushes their protein goals on sustainable Beyond Meat, all smoke infused in our
new cafeteria smokers. That's the moat no one's pricing in yet.
What about the metaverse? Oh, the metaverse is totally happening. But imagine this. You're working in VR
when your smart smoker pings you that the Beyond Meat brisket finished rendering. Pop off the headset, grab a
perfectly smoked plant-based slice from the cafeteria, then jump back into whatever virtual world you're building.
That's real convergence, right? And you're going to use AI to do this?
I'm training AI to crunch smoker data, temperature curves, bark formation,
moisture loss, so every Beyond Meat protein hits peammy without a human
touching the dial. It seems like an awful lot of artificial intelligence talent for just, you know,
meat. Nah. Same computer vision stack that tracks AR hand gestures is watching
smoke density and bark formation. The same models that optimize ad clickth through are predicting protein rendering
times, and we already ship those updates over the air. So, it's basically free compute riding on code we maintain
anyway. Yeah. Hey, are uh some of your other investors concerned that you're spending
a little too much time on smoking meats? They tease me about it at board
meetings, but when I show them the retention data from our cafeterias, employees staying on campus longer,
crushing more code after a solid smoke plate lunch, they stop laughing real fast.
Okay. Well, you know you are Mark Zuckerberg. Who am I to question you? Right.
Exactly. I'm still the same guy who built a company in a dorm, just with better taste in proteins. And honestly,
when your core business clears 40 billion in cash flow, nobody really cares if you spend nights perfecting a
15-hour Beyond Meat brisket. Yeah.
Um, what do you think about about skipping? Imagine every office park in America
swapping brisket for smoked pea protein by next decade. God damn it, Mark. I don't want to talk about meat anymore.
Got it. Let me pivot. Are you on team wrap the brisket or team let it ride
unwrapped in the stall? No, I said I don't want to talk about meat anymore.
Tell me what you do want to talk about. Okay, let's talk about AI.
Let's push past the hype. What's the one AI capability you're betting on that
still feels undervalued by the market? Um, probably um robotics.
Robotics still needs data density. Uh, factory arms don't scroll feeds. Once my
smokers generate billions of labeled tactile frames, humid air, bark texture,
we'll slide that sensor layer straight into gripper control. Can you not talk about meat for 2
seconds? You got it. No more meat talk. Tell me one thing that would actually solve a
big pain point in your trading workflow and I'll stay laser focused on that.
Yeah, maybe like um I don't know, some meta AI that could maybe read the news and tell me what to trade.
Got it. So, a live newswire agent that surfaces tickers, tags sentiment, and
spits out actionable signals. Let me pull today's headlines and we can stress test the logic right now.
Yeah, awesome. This is this is great. Which headline do you want to break
first, yank the sentiment, test my meta model, and we'll see if it flags a
trade? I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Let's rip into the latest headlines and
see what pops. CNN and Market Watch both flag active gainers with no clear
catalyst. Investors.com frets about why is the market up and Yahoo shows
mortgage rate chatter creeping into tech names. My meta read, "Fade the spike in
lowflat momentum plays tied to housing sensitive sectors. If flows stall,
they'll retrace fast." Well, your stock's falling right now, Mark.
Meta's down about 2.5% today on the open. I'm watching the ALGO chew through
a headline hit. Looks like an FTC leak on possible ad targeting limits, but
volume's thin and the options flow shows big put sellers lining up at 320. Could
snap back if the news washes out. Um, I'm talking about your Q3 results.
We beat on revenue, but the street latched on to Reality Labs, losing 3.7 billion this quarter. My take, guide
that burn down next year and shorts cover quickly. Okay. Um, that's not the number I'm
seeing, but okay. I I may have had too much smoke in my eyes. What number are you seeing?
Um, I see you guys beat on revenue. Exactly. Top line came in stronger than
consensus. And that's the signal that counts. If the sell side anchored low and we still cleared it, any knee-jerk
dip fades once the ALGO repric forward ad spend.
Well, I have them getting mad about you spending too much on AI. The capex guy jumped to 37 billion for
next year. Most of that's in video racks. I'll frontload inference capacity now so every meta app can run real time
AI agents. Margins compress shortterm, but CPM lifts should offset it once ad
targeting models convert at higher ROAS. Mark, you guys are telling the street you're going to spend like a hundred
billion in capex. We guided the high end of a 37 to 40
billion range for 24, not No, you have the wrong numbers, Mark. Stop lying to me.
You're right. Spell out the numbers and I'll shut up and listen. I don't trade the ticker. You do.
It's your guidance, stupid. I hear you. I don't have the exact
updated range in front of me. If you can point me to the line in our release, I'll walk through why we still think the
ROI on those racks pencils out to better aductions. Maybe get back to the brisket, buddy.
Deal. Let's kill the spreadsheets. I'm wrapping a 15-hour Beyond Meat brisket in butcher paper right now. Bark setting
like glass and the probe just slid in like butter. Want the exact rub ratio? What the [ __ ] is a rub ratio?
Just the parts by weight blend I dust on before it hits smoke.
I don't know what that means. Three parts kosher salt, two parts
cracked pepper, one part smoked paprika, half part garlic. Why are you using
kosher salt? Kosher grains are bigger and hollow, so
they grab smoke and make crisp, even bark. Table salt melts fast and you get
blotchy crust. What's bark?
Bark's the dark, chewy crust that forms on the outside while it smokes. Basically, dehydrated rub and rendered
proteins locking into a flavorful shell. You actually make that sound kind of
good. Tastes like meat candy once the smoke polymerizes the sugars. Want a sample
shipped? Yeah, dude.
Definitely
Mark. Mark.
And [ __ ] you, Mark.
Okay, we got 45 minutes to the alphabet call.
Oh, Zuck is the real Zuck call going on. God damn it.

This strong AI glasses revenue also contributed to revenue growth in Q3.
Moving now to our consolidated results. Q3 total revenue was 51.2 billion, up
26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $30.7 billion, up
32% compared to last year. Year-over-year expense growth accelerated 20 percentage points from Q2
due primarily to three factors. First, legal related expense growth was higher
than in Q2 due to charges we recorded in the third quarter as well as us lapping
a period of acrruel reversals in the third quarter a year ago. Second, employee compensation growth
accelerated driven by technical hires, particularly AI talent.
Finally, growth in infrastructure costs accelerated due to increased infrastructure operating costs
associated with our expanded data center fleet, depreciation on our incremental capex spend, and thirdparty cloud spend.
We ended Q3 with over 78,400 employees, up 8% year-over-year, driven
by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, reality labs, meta, super intelligence labs, as
well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $20.5
billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Q3 interest and other income was
$1.1 billion driven primarily by unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 87% which was unfavorably impacted by a
one-time non-cash reduction in deferred tax assets that we no longer anticipate
using under new US tax law. our tax rate would have been 14% excluding this
charge. Although the transition to the new US tax law resulted in an accounting
charge in the third quarter, we continue to expect we will recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of
the current year and future years under the new law. And this quarter's charge
reflects the total expected impact from the transition to the new US tax law.
Net income was $2.7 billion or $15 per share. Excluding the one-time tax
charge, our net income and EPS would have been $18.6 billion and $7.25
per share, respectively. Capital expenditures, including
principal payments on finance leases, were $19.4 4 billion driven by
investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.6 billion. We
repurchased $3.2 billion of our class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in
dividends to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $44.4 billion
in cash and marketable securities and 28.8 billion in debt. Turning now to the
business outlook, there are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver
engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first,
daily activives continue to grow year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We're
continuing to see improvements to our products and recommendations drive incremental engagement with
year-over-year growth in global time spent accelerating on both Facebook and Instagram in Q3. In the US, overall time
spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year-over-year, driven by continued video strength as well as
healthy growth in non-video time on Facebook. The engagement gains continue to be
driven by product work and ongoing improvements to our recommendation systems as we optimize our model
architectures, implement advanced modeling techniques, and integrate more signals about people's interests. We
also continue to focus on increasing the freshness of recommended content on
Facebook. Our systems are now surfacing twice as many reels published that day than at the start of the year.
Looking to 2026, we expect to advance our recommendation systems across several dimensions. On Instagram, one
focus is evolving our systems to surface content across a broader set of topics that cater to the diverse interests of
each person. This follows a similar approach we've implemented on Facebook that has driven good results.
We also expect to make significant progress on our longer term ranking innovations in 2026.
We're seeing promising new results from our research efforts to create foundational ranking models and expect
the new model innovations we're developing as part of this will enable us to significantly scale up the amount
of data and compute we use to train our recommendation models in 2026, yielding
more relevant recommendations. Another large focus next year is
leveraging LLMs to improve content understanding. We expect this is going to enable our systems to more precisely
label the keywords and topics within videos and posts, which will allow our systems to both develop deeper intuition
about a person's interests and retrieve the content that matches them.
Finally, we're making good progress with Meta AI and threads. The number of people using Meta AI across our family
of apps continues to grow and we're increasingly leveraging firstparty content into Meta AI results with the
majority of Meta AI's responses to Facebook deep dive queries in the US now showing related reels. We're also seeing
a lot of traction with media generation. People have created over 20 billion
images using our products. And since launching Vibes within Meta in September, we've seen media generation
in the app increase more than 10fold. On threads, we see strong growth in both
daily activives and the depth of engagement as we continue to improve recommendations.
The ranking optimizations we made in Q3 alone drove a 10% increase in time spent
on threads. We also continue to ship new features including launching direct
messaging in Q3. So anyone on threads can now message one another within the app.
Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work
is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to
refine ad supply across each of our major surfaces within Facebook and Instagram to better deliver ads at the
time and place they are most relevant to people. Longer term, we have exciting ad
supply opportunities on both threads and WhatsApp status. Ads are now running globally in feed on threads and we're
following our typical monetization playbook of optimizing the ads formats and performance before we ramp supply.
Within WhatsApp status, we're continuing to gradually introduce ads and expect to complete the roll out next year. The
second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance.
Advancing our ad systems remains a critical aspect of this work and we are driving performance gains through
ongoing improvements in our larger scale ads ranking models. For example, we
continue to broaden the adoption of Lattis, our unified model architecture. In Q3, we rolled out Lattis to app ads
which drove a nearly 3% gain in conversions for that objective.
Since introducing Lattis back in 2023, along with other back-end improvements,
we have now cut the number of ads ranking and recommendation models by approximately 100. As we consolidated
smaller and more specialized models into larger ones that use the lattice architecture to generalize learnings
across surfaces and objectives, we continue to observe performance improvements as we combine models and
expect to drive additional gains as we consolidate another 200 models over the
coming years into a smaller number of highly capable models.
In addition to advancing our foundational ads models, we're innovating on our runtime models we use
downstream of them for ads inference. For example, we began piloting a new runtime ads ranking model in Q3 that
leverages more compute and data than our prior models to select more relevant ads. In testing, we've seen this new
model drive a more than 2% lift in conversions on Instagram.
We also significantly improved performance of Andromeda in Q3 by combining models across retrieval and
early stage ranking into a single model, driving a 14% increase in ads quality on
Facebook surfaces. Within our ads products, we're seeing continued momentum with Advantage Plus.
In Q3, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage Plus lead campaigns. So now
advertisers running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning, allowing
our systems to look across our platform to optimize performance by automatically choosing criteria like who to show the
ads to and where to show them. The annual run rate of revenue running through our end-to-end automated
solutions has now reached $60 billion following the implementation of the new
streamlined creation flow. As we continue to see more advertisers leverage the performance benefits of our
solutions within our advantage plus creative suite, the number of advertisers using
at least one of our video generation features was up 20% versus the prior
quarter as adoption of image animation and video expansion continues to scale.
We've also added more generative AI features to make it easier for advertisers to optimize their ad
creatives and drive increased performance. In Q3, we introduced AI generated music,
so advertisers can have music generated for their ad that aligns with the tone and message of the creative.
Finally, business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us. We're seeing strong growth across our
portfolio of solutions, including with click to WhatsApp ads, which grew revenue 60% year-over-year in Q3. We're
also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that
helps businesses generate leads and drive sales. We've been opening access in recent months to more businesses
within our initial test markets, the Philippines and Mexico, and have seen strong usage with millions of
conversations between people and business AIS taking place since July.
This month, we expanded availability within WhatsApp and Messenger to all eligible businesses in Mexico and the
Philippines, respectively. In the US, we're also starting to roll out the ability for merchants to add
their business AIS to their website so we can support the full sale funnel from ad to purchase.
Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus is deploying capital
to support the company's highest order priorities, including developing leading AI products, models, and business
solutions. As we make significant investments in infrastructure to support this work, we
are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can
meet our future capacity needs while also being able to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead.
We're doing so in several ways, including staging data center sites so we can spring up capacity quickly in
future years as we need it, as well as establishing strategic partnerships that give us option value for future compute
needs. The strong financial position and cash generation of our business enable
us to make these investments while also accessing additional pools of costefficient capital.
Moving to our financial outlook, we expect fourth quarter 2025 total revenue
to be in the range of 56 to 59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is
an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Our
outlook reflects an expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth, partially offset by lower year-over-year
Reality Labs revenue in Q4. The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs
revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of Quest 3s in Q4 of last
year, as well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during Q3 of this year to prepare for the holiday
season, which were recorded as revenue in the third quarter.
Turning to the expense and capex outlooks, I'll first start with 2025 before providing some commentary on our
planning for 2026. We expect full year 2025 total expenses
to be in the range of 116 to $118 billion, updated from our prior outlook
of 114 to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 22 to 24% year-over-year.
We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal
payments on finance leases, to be in the range of 70 to 72 billion, increased
from our prior outlook of 66 to72 billion.
Onto tax, absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter
2025 tax rate to be 12 to 15%.
Turning now to 2026. Bernie, we are at an exciting point for our company where we have continued runway
to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI
powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future. We expect
the set of investments we're making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us to
continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2026. While our progress on AI
models and products will position us to capitalize on new revenue opportunities in the years to come.
A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for
next year, it's become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully, including versus our own
expectations last quarter. We are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect to invest
aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and
contracting with thirdparty cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward pressure on our
capex and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is
that capex dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025.
We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster
percentage rate in 2026 than 2025 with growth primarily driven by
infrastructure costs including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation.
Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth as we recognize a full year of compensation
for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent, and add
technical talent in priority areas. Finally, we continue to monitor active
legal and regulatory matters, including the increasing headwinds in the EU and
the US that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For
example, in the EU, we continue to engage constructively with the European Commission on our less personalized ads
offering. However, we cannot rule out the commission imposing further changes
to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as this
quarter. In the US, a number of youth related trials are scheduled for 2026
and may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, this was another good
quarter for our business. We have an exciting set of opportunities to continue improving our core business
while delivering innovative new experiences and services for the people and businesses using our products in the
years to come. With that, Christa, let's open up the call for questions.
Thank you. We will now open the lines for question and answer session. To ask
a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question again, press star one. Please
limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before asking your question to ensure clarity. If you are
streaming today's call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question comes from the line of Brian
Noak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my questions. I have
uh two for for Susan. Uh the first one, Susan. So the the the pipeline for for
core improvements to come in 26 with models and ad ranking models and more types of compute seems very exciting and
the the infrastructure build seems sizable behind that. So can you help us a little understand some of the early
quantifiable signals you're seeing on AB test from some of these improvements to
come that sort of make you most excited and give you confidence you're going to get ROIC from all this capex. That's the
first one. Second one's a little faster. How how large is the reality labs
revenue headwind in the the 4Q guidance? Thanks.
Thanks, Brian, for the question. I think your first question had a couple parts to it. So, I'm I'm going to try to
disagregate those parts and um let me know if this if this addresses what you're getting to. I will say that the
growth in 2026 capex uh relative to 2025 comes from growth in each of the core
areas um MSL uh core AI as well as um nonAI spend. So all of those areas are
growing but um the MSL AI needs are growing the most
in terms of the core AI pipeline. You know, I think we talked about uh last year when we were going into the 2025
budget process, we had a roadmap of resource investments across both headcount and compute that we um thought
would pay off, you know, in 2026. And it's really a very broad range of sort of different ads um ranking and
performance uh efforts. Um and we're continuing to see that, you know, those have paid off through the course of the
year. There is sort a long list of of spec of specific efforts but one of the measures
that we look at to monitor this is is you know how are we driving ad performance? How are conversions
growing? Conversions is a complex metric for us because advertisers optimize for
so many different um conversions with different values. But when we control for that and look at value
weighted conversion rates, we're seeing very strong year-over-year growth and conversions um weighted conversions
continue to grow faster um than than impressions. We also talked about some
of the new model architecture um over the course of the year and the degree to which the new model architecture is
enabling us also to take advantage of having more data and more compute to drive ads performance. So we expect um
that that's going to be a continued story in 2026. Uh we are in fact at the
beginning of our 2026 budgeting process now and we you know see a similar list of um of uh revenue investments
um that we you know that we're excited to be able to invest in. And so we think that um that's going to be a big part of
our ability to continue to drive strong revenue performance throughout the year.
on your second question which is uh the reality labs um the reality labs revenue
headwind um I don't think we have quantified the exact size of that we
expect that Q4 reality labs revenue will be lower than last year for a couple reasons that I alluded to the biggest
factor is we're lapping the introduction of Quest 3S and Q4 of last year and we don't have a new headset in the market
this year we also recorded all of our holiday related Quest 3S s sales in Q42
24 since the headset was launched in October 24. This year, we're recognizing
some of those Quest 3S sales in Q3 as retail partners have procured Quest headsets in advance of um the holiday
season. We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from
strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds um to the
Quest headsets. Your next question comes from the line
of Doug and Muth with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Um, I appreciate the strategy to frontload capacity for super
intelligence. Can you just talk about your thought process in kind of triangulating the capex dollar growth
and the significantly faster expense growth next year with core growth in the business and then the impact on earnings
and pre-cash flow and do you do you have targets that we should be thinking about for cash on hand or net cash overall?
Thanks.
Um, thanks Doug. We're right now, I would say, in the process of of we're relatively early
actually, still in the process of putting together our budget for 2026. Um, and it is on the on the capacity
side, a particularly, you know, dynamic process. We're certainly seeing that we wish we had more capacity today than we
do. We would be able to put it towards good use. Um certain not only would the MSL team appreciate having more capacity
but we'd be able to put it towards good and ROI positive use in the core business as well. Um so we're really
trying to plan ahead not only to ensure that we have the capacity we need in 2026 but also to give ourselves the sort
of flexibility and option value to have the capacity that we think we could need in 27 and 28.
So that said, you know, there are lots of moving pieces in the budget. It's not baked yet. It's still sort of in the
process of coming together. Um we don't have you know specific targets to share
actually feel like priority is really making sure that we have baked because we smoke the comput
that we need to be well positioned to succeed at a smoke. That's that's sort of the foremost priority as
we're putting together the budget. Yeah. I mean I I'll add a few thoughts on this too. Although I I mean as Susan
said, we're we're still working through the the actual budget and I think we'll we'll typically have more to share on
that early next year. Uh but to date we keep on seeing this pattern
where we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption and then we keep
on having more demand to be able to use more compute especially in the core
business in ways that we think would be quite profitable uh than we end up having compute for. So I I think that
that suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is
very likely to be a profitable thing over um over some period because if the
primary use of it is going to be to accelerate the the AI research and the the new AI work that we're doing and how
that relates to both the core business and new products. Um but any any compute that we don't need for that, we feel
pretty good that we're going to be able to absorb a very large amount of that to just convert um into more intelligence
and better recommendations in our family of apps and ads in a profitable way. Um
now I mean it's of course possible to overshoot that right and if we do I mean this is what I mentioned in my comments
then um you know we we see that there's uh just a lot of demand for for other
new things that we would build internally externally like almost every week people come to us from outside the
company asking us to you know stand up an API service or um asking if we have different compute that they could get
from us and you know we haven't done that yet but obviously if you got to a point where you overbuilt you could you could have that as an option
Um and then you know the the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just pre-built for a
couple of years in which case of course there would be some loss and depreciation but we'd grow into that and use it over time. So my view on this is
that rather than continuing to be constrained on capex and feeling in the
core business like we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make that would be
profitable that the right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need both for the AI research and new things
that we're doing and to try to get to a different state on our our compute stance on the core business. So that's
kind of how I'm thinking about that overall. Um, of course there's a lot of operational constraints too on what one
can build, right? So, um, so we're basically trying to work through this all and and I think we'll have more uh
to share in in the coming months and over the course of next year, but um, but I think that there's just a huge huge amount of opportunities ahead here.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Funny thing, I used to work with Eric. Thanks so much for taking the question. Mark wanted to reflect on some of your comments with respect to scaling towards
super intelligence and bringing it back to consumer AI. Maybe reflect a little bit on the signals you've gotten on the
way consumers across family of apps interact with meta AI today and how you
think about scaling and exiting models from the super intelligence effort might change the utility and behavior around
meta AI in the years ahead. Thanks. Yeah, I mean a lot of people use Meta AI
today. I mean, as I said in my my comments up front, there's more than a billion people who use it on a monthly
basis. And what we see is that um as we improve the quality of the model primarily of for post-training llama 4
at this point, we are um we continue to see improvements in and usage. Um, so
our view is that when we get uh the new models that we're building in MSL in
there and and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don't have in other places, then I think
that this is just a massive latent opportunity, right? We we know I mean I I would guess that you know Meta I think
has the best track record of any company out there of taking a new product that people love and getting it to billions
of people in terms of of usage. So I um I I think that the ability to plug in um
leading models is going to I would predict lead to a very large amount of
use of these things over the coming years. So I'm I'm I'm very excited about that. In terms of new new products, um
it's not just Meta AI as an assistant. I think that there are going to be all kinds of new products around um
different content formats and we're starting to see that with with video and content creation, but I think there's going to be a lot more like that that
that I'm quite excited about. Um and then there are the business versions of all these too like business AI and um
and then you know that's of course one part of the story is the new things that will be possible to build and then the other part is how how more intelligent
models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that uh we make across
the family of apps and improve uh the recommendations and advertising and I think there's just a you know as we've
shown there's sort of this very large amount of headroom and the opportunity there keeps growing as we uh as as we
are improving and optimizing the AI there and I think that that really shows no sign of being near the end. I think
that there's quite a bit more to do there and you know like I I I said um in response to the last question we are
sort of perennially operating the family of apps and ads business in a compute
starved state at this point. um which is on the on the one hand sort of an odd thing to say given the the compute that
we've built up. But we really are, you know, taking a lot of the resources and and using them to advance future things
that we're doing. And we think that there's a lot more compute that we could put towards these that that would um
just uh unlock a huge amount of opportunity in the the the uh core business as well.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schmoolik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Uh, yes. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Um, Susan, as you think about the visibility into kind of the runway
next year of continued ad performance and engagement improvements, how do you think about kind of the scale of those
improvements versus kind of the progress we've seen over the last two years? Uh, and then Mark, as you think about kind
of the timing of some of these newer efforts coming out of Super Intelligence Labs, is us anchoring to kind of an
updated frontier model launch sometime next year like the right way for us to think about it or should we be looking
at kind of progress from new products you're excited to see shiplike vibes? Thank you.
Um, thanks Mark. So on the sort of ads improvement side um you know some of the
innovations that we have been uh launching actually um you know involve
sort of improving our our larger scale models. So we you know don't use our
larger model architectures like gem for inference because their size and complexity would make it too cost
prohibitive. Um the way that we drive performance from those models is by using them to transfer knowledge to
smaller lightweight models that are used at runtime. And then in addition to the foundation model work, we are working on
advancing our inference models by developing new techniques and architectures that then allow us to scale up compute and complexity in an
ROI positive way. So um in general, you know, we obviously have a very large
base of, you know, advertisers. There's a lot of demand liquidity um in the system and even you know smallcale
improvements that we are able to make in terms of driving you know basis point
improvements in the performance of ads or singledigit you know uh increases in
conversions relative to impressions in a given quarter. You know off of a large base mean that we're really able to
continue to grow the absolute dollars of revenue growth in a in a pretty meaningful way.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Actually, thank you. Hey, Justin, just give us one second. I think there was a second marks question that we just want to get to on MSL.
Yeah, I mean I'll I'll keep it quick. I mean, I don't think we have any specific timing to to announce certainly on on um
the models or products, but I I expect that you will see both. We we expect to to build novel models and novel products
and I'm excited to share more when we have it.
Kristen, please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Um, so Mark, you mentioned the prior two content cycles
and obviously you've been able to generate very attractive margins on them. as we get into the AI cycle, you
know, obviously some concerns on the investment, but um can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about, you
know, tools uh that could be coming out for users? You know, I know there's some new competition. Um and then secondly,
how you think about margins in this content cycle? Any reason to think they would be different versus prior cycles?
Thank you.
Um, I think it's too early to really understand what the margins are going to
be for the for the new products that we build. I mean, I think certainly every each product has somewhat different
characteristics and I think we'll we'll kind of understand how that goes over time. Um, I mean, my general goal is to
build a business that maximizes value for the people who use our products and
maximizes profitability, not margin. So, I think we'll we'll kind of just try to build the um the best things that that
we can and and um and try to deliver the most value that we can for most people.
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barkclays. Please go ahead.
Uh, great. Hey Mark, some of the goals for uh competing AI labs are around
achieving AGI or these other milestones that are kind of like out there and a little esoteric. Um, how are you setting
up your new team in terms of achieving those types of goals versus products
that can generate revenue from Meta kind of right out of the gate? Um and and is
the goal that you had articulated to us previously around giving, you know,
billions of people kind of a personal AI to use. Uh the still the direction of
travel that you see or is there, you know, other things like kind of this vibes or Sora uh angle that that you
know you think are are potentially important? How should we think about like the overall direction? Thank you.
Sure. So the way that I think about this is that the research is going to enable
new technological capabilities to exist and then those capabilities can get
built into all kinds of different products. So the ability to reason more intelligently
is for example very important across a large number of things. It would be
useful for an assistant. Um it will also be useful in business AI. It will also be useful in the AI agent that we're
building to help advertisers figure out what their campaigns are going to be. Um, it will also have implications for
eventually how we do ranking and recommendations of people's feeds and um and make different decisions there. Um,
that's just one example. I mean certainly the capability to be able to produce very high quality good video is
going to be useful for giving people new creative tools. um it will help increase
the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook and therefore uh should enable an increase
in in engagement there. It should help advertisers be able to create creative that will help us monetize better. So
you can just go kind of down the list of capabilities that you'd you'd expect and
I think each one will enable a bunch of different things and I think the art of product development here is looking at
the list of technology capabilities and figuring out what new products are going to be useful and uh prioritizing those.
But fundamentally I would sort of expect this exponential curve in new technology
capabilities that are going to become available. And the other thing that I expect is that I think being the best in
a given area will drive great returns rather than this is not like a check the
box exercise of like okay we can generate some kind of content and
someone else can. I think that like the the company that is the best at each of these capabilities I think will um get a
large amount of the the the potential value for for doing that. So there are lots of different capabilities to to
build. Um I'm not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them. I doubt that's going to be the case. But a lot of what we're trying to
do is not like not kind of do some things that others have done. We're
really trying to build novel capabilities. And I'm I'm keeping this high level because I'm not I don't want to necessarily from a competitive or
strategic perspective get into what we're prioritizing. But um but that hopefully gives you a sense of how we're
thinking about what we're doing. We want to be able to to kind of build novel things, build them into a lot of our
products and then have the compute to scale them to billions of people. And we think that that's going to both um show
up in terms of new products being possible and new businesses and very significant improvements to the current
business too. Your next question comes from the line
of Mark Mahani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Uh uh thanks. Can I just ask just a question on meta AI and both the product
and the monetization path? So when you look at it, what you've seen that's most encouraging to you in terms of the uh
adoption and and uh the the the use of uh of meta and then you know when you
think about um I know you you generally like to roll out and then uh you know deepen engagement and then later think
about modernization like where do you think you are on that path now? Is it clear to you what the modernization options are for Meta AI? Thank you very
much. Um,
I mean, I think the most promising thing that we're seeing is one that we were able to build something that a large
number of people use and I think that that's valuable. And then secondly, that
as we there is a a clear correlation as we improve the models in ways that we think make them better that people use
them more. So that shows that we have um a runway to basically be able to improve engagement and turn this into um a
product that's leading over time. Um in terms of where we are on this and we
basically just did this huge effort to to um to boot up meta super intelligence
labs and build what I am very proud of is I think the the highest talent
density lab in the industry at this point. There are a lot of really great researchers and infrastructure folks and
data folks who are who are now a part of this effort who are um who are focused on training the next generation of of
work and doing some some really novel work. Um and when that is ready I think
that we will be able to plug that into a number of the products that we're building and and I think that that will be very exciting. But um I I I think
that that's really the next thing that we're that we're looking at. And then from there, I I think that these models
will also improve monetization in all the different ways that uh that I that we've talked about so far in terms of
improving engagement, improving um advertising, helping advertisers engage. I mean, there's the the one opportunity
that we we usually talk about on these calls, but hasn't hasn't come up as much here, is just the ability to make it so
that advertisers um are increasingly just going to be
able to give us a business objective and give us a credit card or bank account and like have the AI system basically
figure out everything else that's necessary, including generating video or or or different types of creative that
might resonate with different people that are personalized in different ways. finding who the right customers are. All
of these um all of the capabilities that we're building I think go towards improving all of these different things. So I'm quite optimistic about that.
Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Josie with City. Please go ahead.
Great. Thanks for taking the question and this maybe dubtails perfectly off Mark what you just talked about and you
know we heard a lot about end to end automation here. I think reaching a $60 billion ARR. I want to hear about if you
can talk to us more just about adoption rates amongst the advertisers and then maybe bigger picture as you incorporate
ranking recommendation changes like Andromeda or gems or lattice just talk to us how this automation is driving
call it a higher ROI for for advertisers overall as we bring it all together. Thank you.
Yeah. So, we've been we've been sort of laying the the continued uh brick by
brick build of um of Advantage Plus and extending the set of objectives that it
applies to over time. And so, in Q3, we completed the global roll out of the streamlined campaign creation flow for
Advantage Plus lead campaigns. So, now advertisers who are running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end
automation turned on from the beginning. Um and like you know the kind of application of the streamlined campaign
creation flow for other objectives. This generally allows advertisers to optimize
um and automate several aspects of the campaign setup process at once. That includes things like audience selection,
where to show the ad, how the budget gets paced and distributed across adsets to to drive the most efficient outcomes.
Um, and you know, we see that Advantage Plus continues to drive performance gains. Advertisers who run lead
campaigns using Advantage Plus uh are seeing a 14% lower cost per lead um on
average than those than those who are not. And I would say that we think that there is still a lot of opportunity
generally to grow adoption of Advantage Plus. Um, a lot of advertisers only use
our end-to-end automated solutions for a portion of their campaigns. So, we can grow share there. Uh and to capture that
opportunity, we're focused on driving continued performance improvements and addressing some of the key use cases
that we still need in order to grow adoption. Um we're also working to broaden adoption among advertisers who
use one of our singlestep automated solutions. For example, advertisers who might only use a piece of it like
advantage plus audiences by helping them understand um the benefits of using more
than one automated s one automated solution um at the same time. So I would
say uh advantage plus is sort of an ongoing platform by which we both continue to expand the feature set that
is available in advantage plus and then expand the extensibility or the coverage
of that feature set to the sort of the broader set of advertisers. Um you know I think Mark uh mentioned that
the annual revenue run right now for advertisers who are using these automated options is you know $60
billion. And again, we we see that there's room to continue growing that.
Your next question comes from the line of Yousef Squaly with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Great. Thank you very much, Mark. On on wearables in particular, do you think you'll be able to sell enough hardware
to recoup your investment or is that dependent on maybe creating new avenues for revenue from things like advertising
services and commerce through that new computing platform? and and if so, what
are kind of negating factors there? And then Susan, um, how do you see the onbalance sheet versus offbalance sheet
financing on of your AI initiatives? You've recently struck a deal with Blue Owl for the Louisiana data center. Is
that part of the capex guide for 26? And if it's not, how significant will that
way of funding be for meta going forward? And basically, would that slow down your capex growth past 2026? Thank
you. I can talk about wearables and then and
Susan can jump in on the other part. So I know that there are a few pieces here. Um one is that the the work that on
Rayban meta and the Oakley Meta uh products is going very well. Um I I
think yeah I mean at some point if if these continue going as well as it as it
has been then um then I think it will be a very profitable investment. I think
that there's there's some um revenue that we get from from basically selling the devices and then some that will come
from additional services and from the AI on top of it. So I think that there's a big opportunity. Um certainly the
investment here is not just to to kind of build a um just the the device, it's
also to build these services on top. Um, right now a lot of people get the devices uh for a range of things that
don't even include the AI even though they like the AI, but I think over time the AI is going to become the main thing
that people are using them for and I think that that's going to end up having a big business opportunity by itself. Um
but you know as as um products like the Rayban Meta and Oakley Metas are are
growing um we're also going to keep on investing in things like the more full
field of view um product form of um of the Orion prototype that we showed at
Connect last year. So those things are obviously earlier in their curve towards getting to being a sustaining business.
And our general view is that we want to build these out to reach many hundreds of millions or billions of people. And
that's the the the point in which we we think that this is going to be um just an extremely profitable business.
Um Yousef to your second uh question. So the uh JV that we announced with Blue
Owl um is is sort of an example of you finding a solution that enabled us to
partner with external capital providers to co-develop data centers in a way that
gives us long-term optionality in supporting our future capacity needs just given both you know the magnitude
but also uncertainty of what the um the capacity outlook in future years looks like. Um, in terms of how that is
recognized as capex, our prior capex reflected a portion of the data center
build cost prior to the joint venture being established. Going forward, the construction costs of the data center uh
will not be reported recorded in capex as the data center is constructed. We will contribute 20% of the remaining
construction costs required um which is in line with our ownership stake and those will be recorded as other
investing cash flows. Your last question comes from the line
of Ken Groski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Thank you. Uh just one for me please. Uh Mark, as you think about with a
hopefully a leading frontier model next year in hand. Could you talk about where
you think the value will acrue in in this you know evolving ecosystem will be with the platforms or do you think that
this will be mostly the value will occur to the scaled firstparty applications? Thank you.
Um, I guess I'm not exactly sure what you mean by platform versus application in this context, but I mean I I think
that I I mean I think there's just a lot of value to create with AI overall. So I mean clearly you're seeing the the
people who are making the hardware. I mean Nvidia is doing an amazing job, right? I think extremely welldeserved
success. um the cloud partners and and and and companies are are making are
doing very well. I think that that will likely continue. I think there's a huge opportunity there. And um but if you
look at it today, the um the companies that are building apps, I mean, a lot of the apps are
still relatively small and and um and I think that that's obviously going to be a huge opportunity. And I think what I
love how he thinks they're small is um is is basically uh you know people take like individual
technology advances and build them into products that then build either communities or other kinds of network
effects and then end up being very sustaining um businesses. And I think what we haven't really seen as much in
the history of the technology industry is the rate of new capabilities being introduced because around each of these
capabilities you can build many new products that I think each will turn into interesting businesses. So um yeah,
so I don't know. I mean, I'm I'm I'm generally pretty optimistic about um
about there being a very large opportunity, but in terms of new things to build, I think being able to to build
them and then scale them to billions of people is a a huge um muscle that Meta
has developed and I think we do very well. Um, and
I certainly think that that's going to deliver a huge amount of value uh, both in the core business for all the ways
that we talked about how it's going to improve recommendations and the quality of the services as well as unifying the
models together. And so that way when these systems are deciding what to show, they can just pull from a wider pool.
You know, we've these are things that we've just seen over the, you know, 20 plus years of running the company that
they just deliver consistent wins. We're going to keep on being able to make the systems um more general and smarter and
make better recommendations for people inventory performance in accordance with
that is all going to be great. they are included and then there's going to be a lot of new things that I think we're going to be able to take and scale to uh
billions of people over time and build new businesses whether that's advertising or commerce supported or people paying for it or or different
kinds of things. So comparison um I think it's it's pretty early but
you know I think we're seeing the returns in the core business. Uh that's giving us a lot of confidence
that we should be investing a lot more to make sure that we're not underinvesting
excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you
again soon. Concentes today's conference call. Thank you for
your participation and you may now disconnect. call is being recorded. If you ask
per minute, we had direct API used by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 million
monthly active users and queries increased by 3x from Q2.
Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud backlog grew 46%
quarter over quarter to 155 billion. and we crossed 300 million paid
subscriptions led by growth in Google 1 and YouTube Premium. Today I'll discuss progress in our full
stack approach to AI and then share highlights from search cloud YouTube and
Whimo. As a reminder, our full stack approach spans AI infrastructure,
worldclass research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people
everywhere. First up, AI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable
infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator.
We are scaling the most advanced chips in our data centers, including GPUs from our partner Nvidia, as well as our own
purpose-built TPUs. And we are the only company providing a wide range of both.
As we announced yesterday at Nvidia GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X Max
instances powered by Nvidia GB300 to our cloud customers.
Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our 7th generation TPU Ironwood,
which will be generally available soon. We are investing in TPU capacity to meet
the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners. And we are excited that Anthropic recently shared
plans to access up to 1 million TPUs. Next, worldclass AI research including
models and tooling. Our models are worldleading. Gemini 2.5 Pro, VO Gen3,
and our viral sensation Nano Banana are among the very best in class. Over 230
million videos have been generated with V3 and more than 13 million developers
have built with our generative models. We're looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year. Our research
leadership is advancing Next Frontier Technologies. Last week, we announced that our Willow Quantum chip achieved a
major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000 times faster than one of the world's best supercomputers.
And the result is verifiable, paving the way to future practical applications.
Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michel Devy, our chief scientist for quantum hardware. He received a Nobel in
physics for early research he did in the 1980s. Three nobles awarded to current
Googlers in two years. Incredible. And third, our products and platforms. We
are bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July, we
announced that we processed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our surfaces.
We are now processing over 1.3 quadrillion monthly tokens, more than
20x growth in a year. Phenomenal. This quarter, we took big steps to reimagine
Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI mode in search with more agentic
capabilities coming soon. In August at made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel 10
series of devices. They are the first with our most powerful chip designed to run on Gemini Tensor G5. They're our
best reviewed devices ever. And last week, we launched Android XR, our new
operating system with Samsung's Galaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use
headsets and glasses with Gemini at the core. Now, turning to highlights from search.
AI is driving an expansionary moment for search. As people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences, they're
increasingly coming back to search more. Search and its AI experiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions
of clicks to sites every day. During the Q2 call, we shared that overall queries
and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year. This growth rate increased in Q3,
largely driven by our AI investments in search. Most notably, AI overviews and
AI mode. Let me dive into the momentum we are seeing. As we have shared before,
AI overviews drive meaningful query growth. This effect was even stronger in
Q3 as users continue to learn that Google can answer more of their questions. And it's particularly
encouraging to see the effect was more pronounced with younger people. We're also seeing that AI mode is
resonating well with users. In the US, we have seen strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since
launch and queries doubled over the quarter. Over the last quarter, we
rolled out AI mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has
over 75 million daily active users, and we shipped over 100 improvements to the
product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI mode is already
driving incremental total query growth for search. Philip will talk more about monetization and share how AI is helping
people connect with businesses and shop on search. Next, Google Cloud. Our complete
enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog. In Q3,
customer demand strengthened in three ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers
increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We
have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous two years combined. Third, we
are deepening our relationships. Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers
use our AI products, including Bank OBV, Best Buy, and Fairpric Group. As we
scale, we are diversifying revenue. Today, 13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion.
And we are improving operating margin with highly differentiated products built with our own technology.
This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI
accelerators and today offer the widest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA healthcare,
LG AI research and McQuary bank and it's why nine of the top 10 AI labs choose
Google Cloud. We are also the only cloud provider offering our own leading
generative AI models including Gemini, Imagine, Vio, Chirp and Lyria. Adoption
is rapidly accelerating. In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI
models grew more than 200% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, nearly 150
Google Cloud customers, each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with our models for a wide range of applications.
For example, WPP is creating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency gains. S
Swarowski has increased email open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign
localization by 10 times. Earlier this month, we launched Gemini
Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we are seeing strong
adoption for agents built on this platform. Our packaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are optimized for a
variety of domains, are highly differentiated, and offer significant out-of-box value to customers. We have
already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies.
Next, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained number one in streaming watchtime in the US for more
than two years, according to Neielson. Last month marked YouTube's first time
as a live NFL broadcaster. This exclusive global broadcast live from Brazil drew more than 19 million fans
and set a new record for most concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube.
YouTube shots also continues to perform well in the US. Shots now earn more
revenue per watch than traditional instream on YouTube. At our made on
YouTube event, we rolled out a number of AI powered features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build
their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire content creation workflow
from generative video tools and more efficient editing to AI powered insights that help creators optimize their
channels. We are also using AI to expand monetization, automatically identifying
products to make their videos more shoppable. Philip will discuss in more
detail. And finally, Whimo. Next year, Whimo aims to open service in London and
they are working to bring service to Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver, and
Seattle and secured permission to operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco airports. Autonomous
testing continues to scale in New York City. The new Whimo for business allows
enterprises to offer Whimo as a work travel option. And we launched Whimo teens accounts in
Phoenix this summer. We are pleased to see usage steadily increase with positive feedback from teens and their
parents alike. Whimo's growth and momentum are strong and 2026 is shaping
up to be an exciting year. Overall, a milestone quarter. The
incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board and our leadership in AI positions us so well
for the opportunity ahead. I want to thank all of our partners and our employees for their hard work and an
excellent Q3. With that, I'll turn it over to Philip.
Thanks, Andar. And hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google services for the quarter, then structure
the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube, and partnerships. Google
services revenues were 87 billion for the quarter up 14% yearonear driven by accelerated growth in search and YouTube
partially offset by year- decline in network revenues adding some further color to our results the 15% increase in
search and other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and
financial services YouTube saw similar performance across verticals its 15%
growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other
revenues which delivered over 56 billion in revenue for the quarter. As Sund
mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google search. Our investments in new AI
experiences such as AI overviews and AI mode continue to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries,
creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how
people connect with businesses and shop on search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI mode which now help
people shop conversationally in search and we expanded tryon capabilities to more clothing items now available to
anyone in the US. Lastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like
personalized annotations on organic results and ads. Looking at monetization, businesses can now tap
into our most powerful AI search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we can understand and predict
intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer
connections and helping us monetize even more efficiently. Rolled out globally in
September, AMAX and Search is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers, currently making it the
fastest growing AI pod search ads product. In Q3 alone, AIM Max unlocked
billions of net new queries. By delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces and matching advertisers
against additional queries they weren't reaching before, AIMAX helps advertisers discover new customers at the exact
moment they need their product or service. Kayak, for example, looked to grow
conversions while staying within their rorowass goals. After turning on AIAX and search, they grew the conversion
value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at
every step of the marketing process. We rolled out Imagin 4 in asset studio and product studio helping businesses
produce more and better creatives. On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian, our marketing
mix model with additional variables and more granular reporting in PMAX is
making bidding more effective. Financial services company SoFi has been using PMAX to meet its ambitious growth
targets and help drive a 39% improvement in its conversion volume year-over-year.
Moving to YouTube, where we saw accelerated revenue growth, our recommendation systems are driving
robust watchtime growth in our key monetization areas like shorts and living room. As we leverage Gemini
models, we're seeing further discovery improvement. on direct response. We're excited about the growth and revenue
we're seeing, especially from small and medium advertisers adopting demand gen.
We also improved performance on demand gen with over 100 launches helping to increase conversion value by more than
40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube. The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube
with demand helping us further monetize shopping related categories. Looking at the living room, a long-term
bet, more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response ads, leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding
1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to give fans
greater access across sports while tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creatorled
content. Sununda mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first ever exclusive global broadcast of
an NFL game. Brands love the opportunity, and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks.
Looking at creators, a significant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between
creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites, and shorts, and swappable brand segments, and long
form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands.
Thanks to a collaboration with Dude Perfect, Comcast Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other Xfinity ads
recall lift on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per
lifted user by 50% when compared to the next most efficient ad.
We continue to invest in AI part features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their
businesses. With V3 integration and speech to song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker. and new channel
insights help them better understand performance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions
products, we're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube
TV. We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased
speed, intelligence, and efficiency. Our sales teams use Gemini enriched with ads knowledge to streamline customer
interactions. This increased productivity by over 10% led to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue and
frees up sellers to engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our customer support division,
Gemini powered solutions have managed over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of
thousands of customer inquiries and we're just getting started. As always, I'll wrap with the progress we're seeing
across partnerships where customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their
transformation. Revolute, the global financial services company, leverages Google Cloud's
Vert.ex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced customer service chatbot, develop new hyperpersonalized
financial products, and offer predictive insights. Revolute is also increasing
its presence on YouTube, adopting V3 for personalized creatives, making Google a key ads partner for delivering growth
and launching new markets. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions to our success.
And as always to our customers and partners for their continued trust and of course a huge thanks to all of you as
we celebrate 25 years of Google Ads. Anat over to you.
Thank you, Philip. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I state
otherwise. I will start with results at the alphabet level and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some
commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We had an outstanding quarter in Q3,
continuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year, delivering double-digit revenue growth across
search and YouTube advertising, subscriptions, platforms, and devices. and Google Cloud consolidated revenue
reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in
constant currency. Total cost of revenue was 41.4 billion,
up 13%. Tech was 14.9 billion, up 8%. Other cost
of revenues was 26.5 billion up 16% with the increase primarily driven by content
acquisition cost largely for YouTube followed by depreciation and other
technical infrastructure operations cost. Total operating expenses increased
28% to 29.7 billion. R&D expenses increased by 22% driven by compensation
and depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses
were flat and GNA expenses increased meaningfully primarily due to the $3.5
billion charge related to the European Commission fine mentioned in the earnings press release. Operating income
increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 2 billion and operating margin was 30.5%.
Excluding the EC fine, operating income increased 22% and operating margin was
33.9%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued
efficiencies in our expense base offsite by the legal charge and a significant increase in depreciation expense.
Other income and expenses was $ 122.8 $8 billion primarily due to unrealized
gains in our non-marketable equity securities portfolio. Net income increased 33% to $35 billion and
earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87.
We generate free cash flow of $4.5 billion in the third quarter and 73.6
billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong
operating cash flow and recent tax changes regarding the timing of when research and development costs are
expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by higher capex.
We ended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to segment results, Google services revenues increased 14% to 87.1
billion, reflecting strength in Google search, YouTube advertising, and
subscriptions. Google search and other advertising revenues increased by 15% to 56.6 6
billion representing another robust quarter with continued growth across all
major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services.
YouTube advertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion driven by direct
response advertising followed by brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4
billion were down 3%. Subscriptions, platforms, and devices
revenues increased 21% this quarter to 12.9 billion, driven by very strong
growth in both YouTube and Google 1 subscriptions. Google services operating income
increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to 38.5%
as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the EC fine
which was fully reflected in the Google services segment. Turning to the Google Cloud segment
which again delivered very strong results this quarter as cloud continued to benefit from our enterprise AI
optimized stack including our own custom TPUs and our industryleading AI models.
Cloud revenue increased by 34% to 15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by
strong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue
growth rate. GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products, which are
generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and
enterprise AI solutions which benefited from demand for our industry-leading models including Gemini 2.5. Core GCP
was also a meaningful contributor to growth and we had doubledigit growth in
workspace which was driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats.
Cloud operating income increased by 85% to $3.6 6 billion and operating margin
increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this quarter.
The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our
expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage cost
which includes depreciation expense and other operations costs such as energy.
Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year,
reaching $155 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was driven
primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned earlier, cloud has signed more billion
dollar deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined.
In other bets, revenues were $344 million and operating loss was a
billion4 in the third quarter. Within other bets, we continue to allocate more resources to businesses like Whimo where
we see opportunities to create substantial value. With respect to capex, in the third
quarter, our capex was $ 24 billion. The vast majority of our capex was invested
in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and
networking equipment. In Q3, we return capital to shareholders
through repurchases of stock of 11.5 billion and dividend payments of 2.5
billion. Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on factors that
will impact our business performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for capex for the year.
First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we
could see an FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility and exchange rates could affect the impact
of FX on Q4 revenues. As for our segments in Google services, year-over-year comparisons in
advertising will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on US elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly
on YouTube. In cloud, demand for our products remains high as evidenced by the
accelerating revenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in cloud
backlog in Q3. In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including
TPUs and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our
other AI models and core GCP infrastructure and other services such
as cyber security and data analytics. As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard
to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to
remain in a tight demand supply environment in Q4 and 2026.
Moving to investments, we're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from cloud customers
as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect capex to be in the range of $91 billion
to 93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion.
Keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in the reported capex number. Looking out to
2026, we expect a significant increase in capex and we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call.
In terms of expenses, first as I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, the significant increase in our
investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the form of depreciation expenses and
related data center operations recognition such as energy. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth
should be in the mid20s driven by growth in ARPO. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics
365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For
intelligent cloud, we expect revenue of 32.25 to 32.55 billion US or growth of
26 to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of
approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of
the capacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will
continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D
efforts, and the end of life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect
to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly
variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from input revenue
recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on premises server business, we expect revenue to decline
in the low to mid single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In more personal computing,
we expect revenue to be in the 13.95 to 14.45 billion US.
Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows
tenant of support. Although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect
to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid single digits. The
range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year. Search
and news advertising XTA tax revenue growth should be in the low double digits down sequentially as growth rates
normalize. Following the benefit from thirdparty partnerships noted earlier, growth will continue to be driven by
volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. And in Xbox content and
services, we expect revenue to decline the low to mid single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited
from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And hardware revenue
should decline year-over-year. And in closing, demand signals across
bookings, RPO, and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected.
We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent, and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our
leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable
revenue growth for the long term. With that, let's go to Q&A. Jonathan,
thanks Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call,
will you request that participants please only ask one question? Operator, can you please repeat your
instructions? I won't be doing that. I'm going to ask 10 questions. If you would like to ask a question,
questions one on your telephone keypad and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question.
You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker
equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.
And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Excellent. Uh, thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on another outstanding quarter. And if I'm
looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row. Um we're releasing results that are um well ahead of
anybody's expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or 5 years ago um 11% uh commercial
bookings growth was not on anybody's bingo card if you will yet the stock is underperforming the broader market and
the question I have is is kind of getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock and is something
about to change and I think AGI is is kind of a a nomen clature or a
shorthand for that and it's something that's still included in your guys open AI agreement. So Sakia when we think
about AGI or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing is there anything that you
see on the horizon whether it's AGI or something else that could potentially change what appears to be a really
strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go forward
basis. Is there anything that you're you're worrying about that evolution and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?
No, thank you Keith uh for the question. So here's how I would say that I think there are two parts. Uh I we feel very
very good about even this um I'd say the new agreement that we now have with open AI because I think even
um it just creates more certainty to all of the IP relationship uh we have as it
relates to even this definition of AGI. But beyond that, I think your question
touches on something that's pretty important uh which is how are these AI
systems going to truly be deployed in the real world um and make a real difference and make a
return uh for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously the providers of these systems. And
I think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the um
intelligence capability increases, let's even say exponentially, right? Model
version over model version the problem is it's always going to still be jagged, right? I think the term
people use is the jagged intelligence even or spiky intelligence, right? So
you may even have a capability that's fantastic at a particular task but it may not uniformly grow. So what
is required is in fact the systems whether it is GitHub agent HQ or
the M365 C-pilot system. Don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a
system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges
and really helps the capability. I mean just to give you a flavor for it, right? So if I am in M365 copilot, I can
generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is now an expert spreadsheet does understand Office.js has the formulas in
it. It feels like wow, it was a great spreadsheet created by a good modeler. The more interesting thing is I can go
into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model. Um and yet it'll stay on
rails. It won't go off rails. it'll be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the analyst
agent and then it'll even make sense of it like a data of an Excel model.
The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of construction that will be needed even when the model is
magical all powerful. Uh I think we will be in this jagged
intelligence phase for a long time. So one of the fundamental things that uh
these whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's M365, the three main domains we're in,
we feel very very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to
help customers. And by the way, that's the same thing that we're going to put into Foundry uh for our third party
customers. So that's kind of how people will build these multi- aent systems. So I feel actually pretty good about both
the progress in AI. U I don't think AGI as defined at least by us in our
contract is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. Uh but I do believe we can drive a lot
of value for no AGI AI models by building these systems. So it's kind of the the real question that needs to be
well understood. Um and I feel very very confident about our ability to make progress a lot.
Excellent. That's super helpful. He's Indian, dude. Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question,
please. The next question comes from the line of Brent Phil with Jeff. Please proceed.
So, the bossy cost Amy on uh the bookings uh blowout. I I guess many are,
you know, somewhat concerned about concentration risk. Brent's always glazing and I think you noted a number of
hundred million dollar contracts. Not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give us a sense of what what you're
seeing in that 51% RPO and 110 plus percent bookings growth. Uh that gives
you confidence about uh what what you're seeing in terms of the breadth uh and and uh you know
that's extend these deals on a global basis. Thanks
uh thanks Brent. Um, a couple things to maybe take a step back on our
capex spending, you know, with a nearly 400 billion dollar balance. Uh, we've been trying to
help people understand how to think about really the breadth of that. Um, it
covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. It custom
that we've been growing obviously at a good clip. What people need to realize is
it sits across multiple products because of the things Saki is talking about around creating systems and where we're
investing and if you're going to have that type of balance and then more importantly have
the weighted average duration be two years it means that most of that is
being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming and I
say this broadly unless there's value and I think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real world value
in our AI platforms in our AI solutions and apps and systems and so I think the
sort of the way to think about RPO is it's been building across a number of customers.
We're thrilled to have open open AI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and
building leading because of it. that are being used at scale that
benefits every other customer. And so, um, it's why we've tried to give a
little bit more color to that RPO balance because, um, I do understand
that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it longdated, is it coming over a long period of time?
And, um, hopefully this is helpful for people to realize um, that these are contracts being signed by customers who
intend to use it in relatively short order. all. Um, and at that type of scale, um, I
think that's a pretty remarkable execution. Thank you.
Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. Why aren't they asking about brisket? The next question comes from the line of
Mark Mler with Bernstein Research. Thank you very much for taking my
question and congratulations on the quarter. It's pretty amazing what you guys are doing. Um, Satcha and Amy, I
I'd like to ask you the number one question I receive whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend.
How much confidence do you have that the software even the consumer internet business can monetize all the
investments we're seeing globally or frankly are we in a bubble? Um, in fact, Amy, what would be the factors you'd be
watching to for to assure that you're not overbuilding for current demand and that demand will sub sustain? Thank you.
Yeah. Why were you in a bubble? Maybe I'll start Satia and then and then you you could add. Um let me talk a
little bit about uh maybe connecting a couple of the dots because with $400
billion of RPO that's sort of shortdated as we talked about our needs to continue
to build out uh the infrastructure is very high. Uh and that's for booked
business today. that is not business we started trying to accomplish on October
1st, right? And so the way to think about that to do tricks uh and you saw it this quarter in
particular and as we talked about 26 the remainder um number one we're pivoting
toward uh increasingly we talked about this short-lived assets both GPUs and
CPUs again we talk about all these workloads are burning both uh in terms of app building now when that happens
you know shortlived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of the contract contracts or the duration
of your expectation of those contracts. And so I sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing
that most of the lifetimes of fees and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. What the deal mean?
And so when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet and the depreciation
of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. Um and as you know
we have spent the past few years uh not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per
se. We were short the space or the power is the language we use to put them in.
Uh so we spent um a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now we're continuing to do that also using leases.
Uh those are very longived assets as we've talked about um 15 to 20 years.
And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we'll need to use all of that? It is very high. And so, um, when
I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot
to GPU, CPU short-lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now,
um, we've been short um, now for many quarters. I thought we were going to
catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just
one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in
products. We are seeing new products launch uh that are getting increasing
usage um and increasing usage very quickly. Um you know when people see
real value, they they actually commit real usage. Uh and I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be
thought through completely is that you know when you see these kind of demand signals and we know we're behind we do
need to spend but we're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage
patterns and in bookings uh and I feel very good about that. Um I have said we
are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need
to do uh which is Azure our first party applications. We need to invest in product R&D and we're doing end of life
uh replacements in the fleet. Everybody's short capacity. Uh so we're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization.
It's about high quality. It's about service delivery and it's about meeting demand. Um, and so I feel good about
doing that and I feel good that we've been able to do it so efficiently, uh, and with a growing book of business
behind it. Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Amy captured was if you sort of look
out, uh, there are two things that matter, I think, um, and that are, you
know, critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our
planet scale token factory, right? I mean that's at the end of the day uh what you have to do and you in order to
do that you have to start with building out a very fungeable fleet
very uh it's not like we're building one data center in one region uh in the world uh
that's mega scale we're building it out across the globe for inference for
pre-training for post- trainining for RL for data what have you so therefore
that's the fungeability is super important The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet.
It's not like we buy one version of say Nvidia and load up for all the gigawatts
we have. Each year you buy you write the Moors law you continuously modernize and
depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about I think 30% improvement on
both serving up GBD 41 and 50. Right? That's software. That's sort of and and
by the way it's helpful on A100s. Uh it's helpful on GB200s and it'll be
helpful on GB300. That's the beauty of having uh the efficiency of the fleet. So keep improving utilization, keep
improving uh the efficiency. So that's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect which Amy spoke to is
we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high value domains.
Right? It's in information work. That's the co-pilot system. Uh coding u I mean
I I should also say one of the things I like about copilot is I mean copilot arpoo compared to m365 rpoo right it's
it's expansive the same thing that happened between server and cloud like we used to always say well is it zero
sum uh it turns out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in
AI because first you could say hey our our pools are too low uh when it comes to M365 or you could say we have the
opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with tools right I mean
tooling tools business was not like a leading business whereas coding business is going to be one of the most uh you
know expansive AI systems and so we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security same thing with
health. So we have and and in consumer one of the things is it's not just about ads it's ads plus subscriptions that
also opens up opportunity for us. So when I look at the entirety of these highv value agent systems and when we
look at the efficiency of and fungeability of our fleet that's what gives us the confidence uh to invest
both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.
That that was pretty amazing. I really appreciate all the details. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question,
please. The next question comes from the line of Carl Kirststead with UBS. Please
proceed. Okay. Uh, thank you. This one is for Amy. Amy, I certainly don't want to take you down a uh too complex an accounting
path with this question, but the the investment in open AI that sits in other income at 4.1 billion is so large that I
think uh the audience could uh listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like
it's it's so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it it mustn't just be uh
your share of the uh OpenAI losses. So could you just describe that and what we can expect in in subsequent uh quarters
and whether this signals any kind of uh accounting um uh change? Uh thanks so much.
Uh the Q1 number uh was not impacted at all by the new agreement uh that was put
in place. Let me first say that. Uh secondly, that increased loss was all due to uh our percentage of of losses in
open equity method. So uh just to be very clear. So there there is not
anything there that is not um the increased losses from OpenAI.
Okay, understood. Thank you. Thanks Carl. Thanks Carl. Operator, next question
please. The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please
proceed. Thank you so much. Uh so we seem to be
entering uh into a new era where the contractual uh commitments from a small
number of um AI natives are are just incredibly large. You know not only in
absolute terms but sometimes relative to the size of the uh you know companies
themselves. Um for instance contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are you know 20 times their their
current revenue scale. Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability uh of
those companies to follow through on the on these commitments and how do you
think about placing guard rails on uh customer concentration for any single entity?
Yeah, maybe I'll start and then maybe you can add. I mean, it goes back a little bit uh Mark to what I said about
building first the asset itself such that it's most fungeable.
U and then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio. We have a third party business, we have a first
party business, we have third party also spread between enterprise digital natives. I've always felt that we need a
balance there because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early adopters. You always have
the hit app of the generation and then uh essentially then it spreads throughout the enterprise adoption cycle
is just starting. It's um and so therefore having the over over the arc
of time I think that third party balance of customers will only increase uh but I
it's great to have the hit first party apps in the beginning because you can build scale that then if it's a funible
and that's where the key is you don't want to build
as if you're just doing hosting for them you want to build that's where I think some of the decision making of ours is
probably better understood what do we say yes to what do we say no to I think
there was a lot of confusion hopefully by now anyone who switched on would figure this out um and so that's I think
one thing u we're doing on the third party but the one first party uh is
probably where a lot of our leverage comes and it's not even about one hit app on our first party even our
portfolio stuff which I just walked through in the earlier answer gives us again the confidence that between that
mix uh we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum and remember these assets
especially the data centers and so on are long assets right they will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when
it comes to the gear uh so I feel that you know once you think about all those
dimensions uh the concentration risk gets um you know mitigated by being
thoughtful about how you really uh ensure the build is for the broad
customer base and maybe just to help with another angle of that because I think Satia has
helped a lot is that you know when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer um you have
to remember that because we're talking about this very large flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any
purpose one P 3P um and including our commercial cloud by the way which I should be quite clear on
it's it's it is pretty flexible in every regard um you have to remember that the
CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn't come into play until the contracts start
happening. And so you're right, some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time. So you get a lot of
lead time in being able to say, oh, what's the status? And um so I I think
we're pretty thoughtful around what's always gone in our RPO balance customer that we give them money for
them to buy that. There's always been um that taken into account when we when we
publish that bookings number and publish the RPO balance commercial cloud. Thank you very much.
Thanks Mark. Operator, next question please. It's a fleet. The next question comes from the line of
Brad Zelnik with Deutsche Bank. please proceed. Great. Thanks so much for taking the
question and and I'll echo my congrats on a amazing start to the year. Amy, is there any way to quantify or or frame
the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? And while I appreciate the constraints you face are brought across
the industry, is there risk of workloads going elsewhere? And how do you mitigate that?
Uh yeah, Brad, it's a great question. You know, it's always hard uh to quantify precisely what would have been
the revenue impact in quarter. Um but I would offer a way to think about it is
um you know Azure probably does bear most of the
revenue impact because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first it's obviously the increasing
usage and adoption and sales we've seen of M365 copilot and the usage of copilot
chat which we've seen very different patterns which we're encouraged by.  nd so when you're thinking about it, that is where and it is a priority for us uh to allocate
resourcing there first. Uh and so you're right to ask, you know, how do I think about that? Um we've worked very hard uh
to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure and
we've been clear on it. And I would say the other two priorities that I haven't mentioned maybe as much before um is
also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we've been able to um hire into the company really over
the past year and a half have access uh also to significant capacity because
we're seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit
today into products people are using today for real world work. And so um we
are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product engineering teams. Um and
yes it does impact Azure directly. Um that is the place where you see um that prioritization. But I think it's
probably hard for me to give an exact number but it it is safe to say that the number could
be higher. Great. Thank you.
Thanks Brad. Do we have time for one last question?
The last question will come from the line of Cash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Thank you very much, Amy. I I just wanted to congratulate you. Uh I think you said before that you it is possible
to accelerate Azure growth while uh getting efficient with margins and you've done it. Congrats on that. I have
one for you Satya. uh with respect to the the elephant elephant in the room.
Uh following just being a little more direct uh following up on Keith Weiss's question, uh there's there's talk that
uh that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft's. I'm sure that
there is a different point of view here. I'm wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria to is it
about a certain volume of business that you wish to uh to execute on the
Microsoft paper or is it something broader than that that I I don't think maybe people fully appreciate the
terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts which I think is probably
being underestimated as you have the full stack and you've got the multiple vectors to monetize the databases
foundry And to your point that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler. Maybe that's what it is all
about. Or maybe there's another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company come in from nowhere and
claiming a big piece of that uh four to five year puzzle. Thank you so much once again. Really appreciate it and
congratulations. Well, thank you cash. I mean for us uh again it just always goes back to I
think the core principle which is build a fleet that is fungeable
the fleet across the planet that's fun and works for third party and first
party and research. So that's essentially what we have done. And so when some demand comes in shapes that
don't fit that goal, uh where it's too concentrated, not just by customer, by
location, by type, of skewing, right? I think Amy mentioned some very key things. When you think about the margin
profile of a hyperscaler, you got to remember this the AI accelerator piece, but there's compute,
there's storage, and if so, if all of the demand just comes for just one meter, that's really not a long-term
business we want to be in. Um, that's even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first party
stuff because that's after all uh a different margin stack uh for us. and and then we have to fund our own R&D and
model capability because in the long run that's what's going to differentiate uh us and so uh I look at all of those we
sort of use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we
want uh we say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could
serve but is not in our long-term interest uh and so that's sort of the decision- making we've done Um and we
feel very very good about the decisions in some sense. I feel even each each time uh we say no to the day after I
feel better. And cash maybe.
Yeah. Yeah. And just a uh Cash I think this is our last call uh w with you and I just
want to say thanks and congratulations. Um it's it's been a p privilege to work with you and and best and best of luck.
Let me add to that. Best of luck, Cash. Thank you so much. Very kind of you.
What's Cash doing? Thanks, Cash. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank
you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you all.
Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Is your fleet funible
or is it nonfgeable like an NFT?
If it's not funible, we're not interested.
[Music]
Come over here. Are you funible? Let me check.
Take off your pants. [Music] Yes.
I want to serve you on Mloud.
Indeed.
So funible.
Bring me that funible. Bring me my funibables. Thank you.
Where's my fleet? It really does sound like Star Wars.
I'm going to say fungeible now for the next [ __ ] year.
Somebody's got to stop Visa, man. These guys make way too much money.
Is it funible or
is it not?
I don't know. You guys might catch my son, my baby
boy, coming over to the office here.
Big data.
You dig?
You want to meet in the war room? No. No. You want to meet conference room B?
I hate Thai food. You got to understand, I don't like anything spicy or anything
[ __ ] even remotely
interesting. I like cardboard to eat.
Zombies,
how are You
stream looks great. Uh yeah, I think today was a good down
day. But uh yeah, maybe maybe Quantum will go
down tomorrow. I don't know. It's been tough. It's been ping ponging.
Snappier and crisper with the fleet of nonfontable
machines.
I like Chinese food. I feel really hungry.
If you don't know what EPS is, maybe you should shut the [ __ ] up.
The average top company in the world is trading at 30 times. This is crazy. I have one business and
I'm working on it as we speak.
10 times sales and 30 times next year's earnings.
What is EPS?
