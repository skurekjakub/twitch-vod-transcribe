Hey guys, make sure you hit subscribe. I'm trying to get to that 100K.
Help the brother out.
You just have to keep adding to the short. Gavin, good morning. What's up?
What's up, Kev?
Baby's good.
Rainy New York for sure.
I don't think we're going to ban short selling now.
Can't ban the options market. Can you
Haven't
listened to the new Mom Deep
unsolicited takeover. Metera
9 billion bidding war, huh?
Nvidia down 2% has traded the most 36 million
shares. Chapal Chipotle
down 18%. Meta down 10% 11%. Alphabet up only 4% now after being up eight or
nine% last night. Pretty ugly out there. Intel down 1%. Open Door down.
Comcast down, Tesla down 2%, Amazon down 2%.
Microsoft down 2%. Recovering some losses there. Palanteer only down 1%, Regetti down 1%. Those are the most
actively traded. But gainers, emergence up, Gardant, Glauos, Metera with a rival bid from
Novo topping the Fizer offer for Metsera. Cardinal up 18%. Bosch up 15.
Divior up 15. Faithm up 11. Inat up 11. Align up 11.
Big losers we got FMC down 41%.
Sprouts Farmers Market a growth stock down 26%. Appella down 20%. Chipotle
down 18 as I mentioned earlier. Baxter down 16. eBay down 15. Carvana down 13.
WPP advertising giant down 16. Uh Roblox down 12.
Uh Meta down 11. The big news is it capex scaring
investors. No big guidance update there. Um but again, Meta keeps beating. So I
don't know. I kind of like Meta by value. Meta traded the most. Uh $16
billion, which is only 1% of their market cap. Nvidia
five trillion cap unbelievable very little traded as a part of their
market cap. It's kind of interesting. Most people with Nvidia stay put.
Google third most traded.
Looks like the market's kind of getting back to a normaly here where it's not open door and quantum leading
the way anymore and trading. I saw the Korea numbers for trading
quantum and they were pretty tepid.
How to do fundamental analysis? Good question. question everyone disagrees on.
Uh, Nvidia is nothing like Bergkshire.
Abbyax over 100. Congrats. I hope you bought it with me. We I think doubled our money at this point on Abbyax. One
of my favorite biotech picks.
Yeah, I'm not too interested in trading Nellia.
But yeah, you know, I I agree. you know, it was a stock that you you're you know,
holding it would have benefited you greatly and not touching it. Kind of kind of like the same philosophy some
Bergkshire you investors have, but not uh obviously not a similar company in in
any way. But I see what you what you mean.
Um Extropic, you know, shown some interesting technology. I don't know
that world that well. You know, uh, P bits are
an interesting idea. Probabilistic bits. It's unclear if, uh, how useful they'll
be. I don't know. I just don't know. I'm coming back here a little bit.
I need a coffee, guys.
I think I think people have Well, performance-wise, let me think.
There are people with pretty good records out there. I mean, Buffett's is so good because it's so long.
Yeah, I'm friends with Beth, of course. Beth is great.
I trust Beth quite a bit.
Yeah. Oh, I I should look at the drone stocks.
Well, I guess to put it simply to do a fundamental analysis is to look at the details of the company
and to try to value value the company the best you can. I mean, that's really
What fundamental analysis is
Buffett missed on a lot of things, but I think the point is his long-term track record is about as good as it gets.
Why don't we take a look at Bergkshire real quick? Yes, I'm still in a halfway house. That
is true. Don't hold it against me.
3 years later,
just trying to make ends meet here with this prison system, you know.
Harden harden these streets. Absolutely. you know.
No, I don't I don't live in the half
with the anky. No, I haven't had the ankle bracelet in almost three years now. And I just got
off probation. So, I'm in jail. Don't tell the warden,
please.
I had dinner with George Santos last night. It was great.
2679 23 25 323
right. Exactly. No FPS.
Santos, not Soros.
Demon. I'm a demon.
Where' uh where'd Brookshire's debt go? Paid loss, unearned premiums.
Maybe I'm not counting the right stuff here. It's a one trillion dollar balance sheet. It's kind of amazing.
Maybe I have to count the Let me see how I'm counting it.
Okay. Basically have a lot of different lines of debt.
Sometimes your policy.
It's a little confusing.
Morning.
Yeah, I don't know how Bergkshire gets the exception. Did I sleep well? Evidently not.
Anyway, I'll I'll I'll get through it. Cash
for Berkshire. Haven't looked at Bergkshire balance
sheet in a while. It is a fairly confusing entity obviously.
I have a GitHub. It's a github.commartensleymodels.
Okay, let's see if we can get this in one shot. Start with shareholders equity. That's
easy.
So, what's debt and what isn't? I think I'm including all
insurance stuff is debt on the insurance side for the liability side.
Any policy holder liability is debt because you're getting the float as
cash.
Okay, if you do that, it's actually pretty easy.
Okay. Yeah, that worked fine.
I guess Bergkshire is using a little bit of their cash for buybacks.
Stock hasn't done very well, right?
Yeah, Nyl is selling like crazy.
I remember accidentally buying a 100 shares of Berkshire A for like 20 million.
They were like, "Oh, this was an accident, right?" And I was like, "Uh, no.
top news alert. US stocks Snapchat Wall Street opens lower after mixed tech earnings Fed comments.
Yeah, markets uh the frothy stocks don't want to really go down.
Quantum, Joby, Olo, they're all kind of
only only open is really falling.
All right, I'm going to grab a coffee. I'll be right back, guys. Don't go anywhere. Make sure you hit subscribe.
Okay, got my rocket fuel.
Are you crying? You bought a stock and you're down. A poor baby need a bottle. Oh no.
Oh no. Little baby little baby needle bottle.
You're You're broke. You're [ __ ] poor.
You're broke. You're [ __ ] poor.
You're broke. You're [ __ ] poor.
[Music]
It's puddle.
You're broke. You're [ __ ] poor.
Um, let's see.
There's not many sellside analysts on Bergkshire.
Berkshire's 16 times EV to E.
with no growth planned or no growth estimated. But
yeah, it's hard. It's hard to grow Bergkshire. I mean,
yeah, we got to look at Biohaven. Let's look at Bio Haven.
[Music]
Everyone wants to have a Bergkshire Hathaway. It's very hard to actually do.
Buffer really thought different. I mean, he was really creative.
Okay, so here's Biohaven. Haven't looked at it in a bit. $18 stock, 1.8 billion cap.
Let's dig in.
Vlad has a great track record. You know, he sold most of Biohaven already.
or like what was it 15 billion or something. And so this is kind of what
was left over from the Fizer deal when they sold the migraine drugs to Fizer.
Shares out hasn't changed. Yeah, they're not so cashri.
That's all right.
Trying very hard to Oh, they do have a debt there. 25770.
Okay, so they need some cash. But regardless,
yeah, they're spending a lot. Six spent 600 million this year. Jesus
Christ. So this is kind of new biohaven founded
2022 but it had all the old drugs. So
you know it's kind of this big portfolio of medicines and the main
thing going on here is troll tis razol. I see I've been following this drug for
years. I don't even know how to say it. Let me see if YouTube has a
an official way to say it.
Just as a little introduction um you know that the uh you know spinal cord
injury is a major public health problem also it's a major clinical challenge but it's also major public health problem
because of the profound impacts it has on the people and then you know beyond
the as as we all know beyond the supportive care u and emergency surgery
and a little of the uh conflicting evidence about the use of cortical steroids. We really don't have much of
the uh choices how to treat this injury and various uh
treatments have been attempted and the none of none of them has shown any
success yet. So one of the possibilities or
opportunities to try to uh do something with the acute spinal cord injury and
its consequences is the neurop protection and the one of the best known
um pharmaceutical treatments for uh in this area is the sodium channel broker
or riyosol and you know riyosol has been approved for the amotrophic lateral
sclerosis. Yeah, I always called it reallyol, but it's riyosol. And uh this thing's been around forever.
Uh in this area is the sodium channel brocker or riolen.
And I think the mechanism action mechanism of action was always a little
kind of confusing. Um and everyone's tried to get it to work
in different diseases. So they have troll tro trovaleazol reallyol
and it's just a I think it's a pro drug you know basically um
so we're going to see if we can find out how the FDA is going to
decide here but they have so many assets. I mean
they really do. It's a huge portfolio and I like most of them you know. So I've always liked this stock. I actually
never liked tro riyazol because I
you know it's like classic biotech guy wouldn't like it either. I mean it's but you know it's
something where you know you have to I mean let's see what the FDA says and let's see what they're they seem very
convinced and you know the guy sold a company for 14 billion so I'm not going to sit there and say I know better than
him. Um, you know, I'm not saying he knows better than me, but I want to hear what Mal, you know, what is he what is
he thinking? Um,
stocks go up, stocks go down. You got to wait it out sometimes. All right, so they had this study 206
study phase three. Is this the same study? We just got to
go through this really carefully. BB4157206. So obviously, you know, the company's
going to be out there lobbying trying to get the FDA to say yes.
CA primary endpoint. Sara did not reach that sig as there was
less than expected. Okay.
Oh, they had a refusal to file.
This is 206 RWE.
I'm going to read this really slowly because it's a little confusing, but it looks like there's the 206RWE,
which I don't really know how that differed from 206. So, but we'll look at it.
OCD failed.
Okay, let's see.
See what PMD says. I wish I was quantum, man. You know qu you know how hard quantum is to learn.
It's [ __ ] impossible.
Let me show the the dilly.
Really is a bit of a orol is a bit of um
bit of a confusing drug. Nobody really knows how it works.
I mean, nobody knows if it works. The data it was approved on for ALS was pretty minimal. And honestly, I don't
think the drug was used that heavily in ALS. And it certainly wasn't priced like it worked, but it was also like kind of
I wouldn't say before the rare disease era, but it was it was a while back.
AI is a bubble, but quantum isn't.
I don't find myself using ZHO too often anymore, though. I'm antipiriracy, man.
I think if you if you can afford it, you should do it yourself. You can't afford it. Well,
yeah, Ari, I'm with you. I understand what you're saying.
Let's see what they said here. Access denied. Damn, that's cold. Cold blooded.
Right on their website, you put the link up and tell me access denied. [ __ ] out of here.
talking about access denied, bro.
Well, we can view the presentation at least
I've always been antipiriracy if you can afford it. If you can't afford it, steal that [ __ ]
Get your ass back down.
Just have to understand what what this study was.
Get your ass back down. Novelly, novel, rationally designed therapy. I don't know about that.
Glutamate disregulation increases in calcium.
[Music]
Talk to me.
Yeah. Dowo, I know what you mean. This is annoying as hell. Clono is basically up right now.
[ __ ] Open's down. BTQ is down, but Lays is up
for some reason.
Pain in the ass, man.
No, neutropics is are not a real thing in my opinion.
So this is the primary end point at three years.
Okay. But did they do a study? How they trillia threeyear fsara?
Okay. Yeah, you're right. ZW, totally agree. I
know. Stimulants so annoying. What the [ __ ]
Okay. Well, hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Just a second. Over here. I spy with my little eye.
You guys see this chat?
saying keep an eye on that.
Oh, they're not all SCA though. Oh, this is for all SCA. I thought it was just SCA 3.
The [ __ ]
Felt that.
This is also uh
Okay. Okay. Well, they still beat Euro SCA. In fact, that data looks better.
Okay. So, the first concern I had was that the baselines are imbalanced, but the Euro SCA data looks quite similar
the baseline to the 206. And so, here the European baseline was also they beat
that as well. So, that's good. Pulled data.
But now we get back to this issue which is how did what happened here with these patients. But here this looks much more
robust. So the you know the dropouts and the sensoring looks fine. That looked like a fear for a second.
I mean it's kind of might be hard to say no to this.
where did they say high high SD
p value less than 0.001 O1 on this 05 here.
No, I didn't see that. Monte Crystal. What a crybaby. [ __ ] can't cry, man. It's war in
these markets. You got a problem with your returns? Try harder.
Ask me about Ataxia. H you know there's a thing about you guys
may not know this but if you have something that says ask me in BioParma
you're you're only allowed to promote a drug if it's on label. In other words if it if it has a FDA approval for that
disease. But if you have something that says ask me about Ataxia
and then you um and the drug is for atexia,
you're allowed to do that. And if the doc asks you, you allowed to tell them
about the off label use. It's a very like you know
like like funny, you know, thing that you can do.
It's
a little loophole.
Okay. No, Friedri's attackia and SCA or spinos
cerebral attacks are different things.
Isn't that funny? Yeah. So people wear these buttons that are
like ask me about this thing and doc is like what about this thing and you're
like oh well you know since you asked I can tell you that uh LA is an excellent drug for whatever disease you want.
Depression yeah it works for that. Anxiety. Yep. Absolutely.
My patients um his problem is Oh it works. Don't worry. You didn't even let me finish.
Tell me they're going to rally quantum on a day like today.
Man, not feeling that, man.
Vlixia. Viglixia.
You know there's another way. You guys want more tricks? Want me to do some tricks on it? I will.
Vigix. [Music]
Watch this trick. vigia.com
page is parked. What happens when it's not parked no more?
See, I'm putting you on. I'm putting you on.
I spelled it wrong, too. Here we go.
That's parked as well.
I'mma buy it for 20 bucks.
Let me buy that.
I'm three steps ahead.
Now maybe a label pops up.
You know, maybe a label pops up.
If this drug gets approved, what does the stock go to? 50. I'm not
mistaken.
20 calls are five bucks.
Damn. So, if the 20 calls are five bucks and
it goes to 50, I turn five into the 30. That's a quick flip. That's a quick come
up. All I need to know is is it going to get approval?
Ari's question. Would payers reimburse? I don't know, man. I mean,
uh, yeah, I don't know.
Okay. Search did not return any results. I see.
I think I wrote some software to Oh, somebody did a foil log. Okay, I see
you play boy. Let me see that. Let me see that log over there.
[Music] Let me see that log then.
Bernstein Littleits
little foyer there. That's a law firm. So
72. two.
Another 72.
CNBC.
fascinating.
A lot of foyer requests,
insider info requests. So anyway, we're on watch trying to
Did I download the first one or the second? trying to figure out if um
if this drug is approved, you know, there'll be some document somewhere that shows that and
we want to uh see that before anybody else so we can
make 50x our money. That make sense? Or 5x
any x.
So that's going to be the drug's name, I guess, vigia.
But sometimes at the last second, the drug names change. again. The FDA
is Oh, yeah. Don't tell anybody. Don't snitch.
Snitching. Snitching is a problem. Now, what we're doing is completely
completely legal. Okay. Don't ask any more questions, though,
please. So, the FDA's website is a little bit
scrapable. So, they'll probably put out some kind of press release.
It's not always clear that they they don't always put out a press release.
Just because a drug gets FDA approval doesn't mean the stock will go up.
Uh, well, thank you so much, Nick, for that insight. But in this case it does.
They have not announced the exact date.
What are we talking about? What drug? Of course, we're still on Troillazol. We've Listen, you figure out the Troillisol
approval, you make five mil real quick or 50. For me, it's more like five. But [ __ ]
maybe you make 50.
Some of y'all really don't have any money, though. You're trying to flip 3K into 15K.
Don't make me put out the Andrew Tate again.
You're broke.
So, Ricky Low. Ricky lick a wall.
Flip it. Reverse it. You're [ __ ] broke.
I like SPB. I didn't change my mind.
Yeah, he knows what I'm Brian knows what I'm talking about.
Yes, I'm still in Sarapa. Open door down 67% there. The whole Eric
Jackson portfolio is going to zero, dude. [Applause] [Music]
I don't know if the adcom is relevant. I almost think adcom's a I don't know
there's there's a distribution there. Adcom is either no adcom is really good or really bad.
I am. Yeah, you do have that going for it. It's got a It's a rare disease drug.
Very capable management. Very plausible approval on the real world data.
Let's see what my favorite Swiss banks has to say. Shout out to UBS here.
I ain't reading all that. happy for you or I'm sorry it happened
only remaining so no there's a lot of Swiss banks there's vontoble there's many others
called the analyst live let's Oh.
Oh, this is the same expert doing it for the whole cell side.
Okay, we got JP Morgan.
No, there's a lot of Swiss banks left. Don't get it twisted.
70 page slide deck. God damn. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
I need this 70 page slide deck. I probably have it somewhere.
JP Morgan says 40% of approval at least into the 30s for the stock
good case. They got this weird middle ground where restricted label. I don't
think that would be bad, my man or my girl.
I mean, the 35 calls are two bucks, so it's not like
Yeah, I think I think it hits 40.
Yeah, buy haven really is a great long-term outlook.
I don't know what the FDA is going to do.
Ah, this is the 70page slide deck. This is all you need to understand Biohaven.
Just join Godell terminal and it's yours.
Well, the refusal file wasn't wasn't good.
I was thinking about buying meta, too.
You got to email me, Ari. You're you're by, right? Support your boy.
man. I don't ain't feeling doing all this research, man.
I'm just going to call Trump. China.
Let me see if I could get Trump on the line, man. Who the [ __ ] wants to do research?
I won't do insider info, baby.
See if I can get Trump on the line. Man,
listen up. You little [ __ ] You think you can just waltz in here asking me about biotech and FDA [ __ ] I swear
to God, if you waste my [ __ ] time with some amateur hour questions, I'll make sure your career is dead than
Biden's brain cells. Oh, okay. Trump. Um, what do you think about the Biohaven drug?
You mean that worthless [ __ ] Nerk [ __ ] for migraines? Biohaven's just another bunch of pharma crooks charging
800 bucks for a pill that gives you the shits and barely works better than a [ __ ] aspirin. Iota come down there
and choke you with those garbage tablets if you think that's real innovation, you clueless little prick. Uh,
no. I was asking about their uh atexia drug.
Oh, that horseshit experimental compound BHV-4157.
The FDA let them fast track because no one gives a [ __ ] about taxia patients. It's a glorified vitamin that flunked
every real end point. But hey, anything to pump that market cap those Biohaven bastards practically jerked off on the
advisory committee until they got approval. Why the hell are you wasting oxygen on this loser chemical instead of
something that actually works? Well, um, it's not approved yet, Mr. President.
No [ __ ] It's not approved, you [ __ ] So, stop wasting my time fantasizing about some future flop that probably
won't even survive the next PDFA review. Got it. It's pronounced padufa. Mr. President,
don't you dare correct me, you sniveling little prick. I've been screwing the FDA since before you could spell pedufa. So
shut your mouth before I rip out your tongue and stable it to the warning label of that dead on arrival drug
you're jerking off over. Mr. President, people with Ataxia are suffering. They need a new drug.
I don't give a rat's ass how heart-wrenching the Saab stories are. If the data is garbage, the drug stays off
the market and you can take your bleeding heart guilt trip and shove it straight up your own ass.
Uh, Mr. President, you know I'm a fan of yours. I just think you should help my portfolio out.
You want me to pump your pathetic little Robin Hood account, you brown-nosing leech? Tell you what, scrape together
every dime you've got. Short that biohaven garbage and maybe I won't send the IRS to crawl so far up your cull and
you'll be [ __ ] tax forms for a decade. Mr. President, I donated to your campaign committee. How can you treat me
like this? I don't give a flying [ __ ] if you
mortgage your double wide to send me a check. Your 50 buck donation doesn't buy you jack [ __ ] So quit whining before I
make sure the only thing your portfolio ever cures is your will to live.
You seem a lot friendlier on TV, Mr. President. Television sanitized garbage for the
gullible rubes. You starruck halfwit. This is the Oval Office, not some [ __ ] game show. And right now, your
whining is about as useful as a condom in a convict. So, pipe down before I sit the FTC on your penny stock pipe dream
and watch it burn to ash. Mr. President, I don't know if you know who you're talking to, but this is
Martin Skrey from New York. I know exactly who you are. You cocky
little farmer prick. The failed hedge fund wannabe who jacked up prices until the entire country wanted your head on a
pike. Keep running your mouth and I'll bury your entire operation and so many subpoenas your fancy lawyers will need a
[ __ ] mining crew to find daylight. Now crawl back to your garbage Twitter account before I revoke every clearance
your shitty company ever sniffed. Mr. President, I was hoping you would give me a pardon.
Listen here, you price gadgeting little weasel. A pardon's got zero to do with biotech and you damn well know it. Beg
me on your knees. Donate every crooked dime you ever scammed and maybe I'll throw your sorry carcass a lifeline. But
if you waste one more second of my time, I'll make sure federal prison feels like a [ __ ] five-star resort compared to
what I'll unleash on you. Also, I wanted to talk to you about quantum computing.
Quantum computing? Jesus Christ, you arrogant little prick. You can't even handle a goddamn pedopha calendar and
now you want to jerk off over cubits. Stick to your shitty pharma pumps before I rip that tongue out and feed it to the
superconducting chip you couldn't understand if it bit you in the ass.
Oh, Mr. Trump, I want to make sure that you do not uh give the quantum computing companies any money.
I'll strangle every subsidy those quantum nerds beg for if it keeps another dime from your grubby hedge fund
clause. So shut your mouth before I shove your portfolio so far down the quantum rabbit hole it decoheres into
pure piss.
Are you having a bad day, Mr. President? Listen, [ __ ] I'm having a peachy
day ramming excellence down the FDA's throat. So stop sniffing my mood like a
nosy little terrier before I rip that concern off you and shove it straight up your own quantum mass where it belongs.
Mr. President, I know the quantum companies are lobbying for money and I demand that you refuse their
web search, quantum computing, federal funding. October 2025, White House
lobbying. Mr. President, I demand you refuse their
interests. You demand [ __ ] you arrogant little pissant. If those quantum beggars cross
my desk, I'll torch their requests so fast their lobbyists will need [ __ ] burn unit beds. So back off before I
staple your demands to your nuts and mail them to the Commerce Department myself. Mr. Trump, I'm going to vote for Mayor
Mom Donnie in the New York City election. Vote for whoever the hell you want.
Trump Mama Donnie, a dead squirrel in a tutu. I truly don't give a flying [ __ ]
Keep blathering about politics and I'll gut every federal park your bankrupt hedge fun.
You know what, Mr. Trump? I'm gonna be voting for Bernie Sanders.
Vote for that crusty communist cadaavver and I'll make damn sure the IRS audits
every penny you ever skimmed while the SEC buries your tickers in so much
paperwork you'll be begging for Bernie to nationalize your ass just to end the misery. Now buzz off before I squash
your portfolio like the roach it is. You know, Mr. President, you're guilty of 34 different felonies, right? Do you
know that? 34 [ __ ] bookkeeping Mickey Mouse charges, you sanctimonious prick. Means
nothing while I'm still running the goddamn country. Keep paring that loser DA's fantasy or I'll sick every
threeletter agency on your She's not a loser. She's not a loser. Leticia James is a queen.
Leticia James is a grandstanding hack who couldn't litigate her way out of a paper bag. And if you keep slobbering
over that clown show, I'll have a [ __ ] consent orders stuff so far down your throat, you'll be [ __ ] New
York civil penalties for a month. Now crawl back to your Bernie rally before I unleash the full wrath of federal
enforcement on your garbage portfolio. I'm going to the no Kings rally.
Congratulations, you virtue signaling clown. March around with your little no king sign while your penny stock circle
the drain and the SEC builds a bonfire out of your filings. When you're done
playing revolutionary, remember I'm still the one who can vaporize whatever shell company you're hiding behind. So
enjoy your protest before you crawl back here begging me not to nuke the last diseased dollar of your portfolio.
Capicha. All right, Trump, I got to go. You seem like you need need a nap.
Take your limp dick exit before I shove that nap straight up your ass and subpoena your dream.
All right. Trump didn't help us at all. We don't
know if if if approval is coming or not.
What I'm trying to figure out is was the RWE a totally separate study or is an extension of the other study. The only
reason I'm curious is if same starting date
they must have started that and then it went into the other
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the kind of ran this into that.
Okay. So, all these have been any SCA patient. So, it's not SCA3,
it's all SCA
2011. Efficacy P value 0.52
is lower better here for Sara.
Lower is worse. I think really close to no no significance here.
I mean really close to no no change at all basically. In fact, patients who considered
themselves improved was higher in placebo. So it's a little worrisome there.
Although the far did seem to they seem to do better.
No, I'd rather not short Biohaven because they have a lot of good assets and they have a lot of good they have a
really good management team.
Yeah. So, the first study was actually like somewhat in favor of placebo
and this study. Okay, that's the extension study. Let's look at the next study.
P value 75. Rough. So, you get two studies in a row that
show no efficacy. Damn.
The subgroup of SCA3 isn't really that convincing.
Okay, RWE was their best looking thing, but
it's really just not concordant with the other studies.
Uh, Red Rose. Well, BTQ and CCCX are garbage companies
that are going to zero.
It seems like the doctors want it.
Yeah, Regetti's going to 02. Of course, Regetti has no chance. Regetti's got the
worst of the superconducting. And superconducting, it's not even clear you can scale that at all.
Could be very tough for them to scale that. I don't think they know how to.
And then D-Wave is like complete garbage. I was I bought it a while back
and I [ __ ] sold it because somebody in Goodell told me INBX wasn't a good long. They said they were short and I
was like, "All right, whatever." I sold it. You know, they were like, forgot what they said. It was like something very [ __ ] minimal.
And I'm pissed because I the data was pretty good.
That drug pharmacy dude, Martin, what's his name? Squirrely.
Well, once D-Wave reports their next quarter, maybe it'll be a little
more clear that they're not going anywhere fast. BTQ and open though. Ah, BTQ is diving.
Lays as well uh is up, but CCCQ or CCCX is down. It'll be really interesting.
I don't know in Biohaven, man. This is a tossup. I mean, I could see it both ways. And so, the question is, do we
want to I almost feel like you have to buy a little bit just in case, let it, you
know, if it fails, the deck is cleared for I mean, expectations are low, right?
All right. The stock's gone from 50 to 18.
So like it's kind of bottomed out in a way.
Open army. We're holding the lines. Yeah. Can't believe D-Wave's at 40. It's so [ __ ] ridiculous.
34. Abby at 106. Let's go.
We're getting 36 cents.
We live in Who said price don't matter?
Who said price don't matter? Price always matters.
don't matter. Yeah, I didn't really know INBX and this
guy sounded like he knew it and
Well, I think to really understand Biohaven, you're going to want to know the rest of the portfolio. And they kind
of have a really good rest of the portfolio. So,
this might actually, if they get approval, it's obviously really good news. If they don't, and I know they're
trying really hard, maybe it clears the deck
in a way that's kind of positive so that like the street can focus on the other drugs because I think there's been this
focus on this drug
and I'm a little tempted to buy
Yeah, they're burning a lot, but they can always raise more money and monetize drugs, I think.
Dress up for Halloween. Oh, yeah. Maybe I should.
It's also been climbing into this approval. Not that that matters much, but it's kind of interesting.
I'd rather not gamble. We should, you know, avoid avoid gambling. I'm not
paying any attention to Nilia. Company is just cursed.
Management already sold a big company. They seem very good at portfolio management. So yeah, they they had a $14
billion exit and the portfolio looks great. I mean,
hard hard to bet against these guys. So it's kind of like you buy a little here
at 2 billion, maybe you get a chance to buy more at 1 billion, but if they get approval, we're headed
to 6 billion. they don't get approval, they're still
probably heading to six billion because they they're pretty good and they've got good assets.
It's hard. It's hard. It's hard.
Yeah, we can definitely look at Resolute.
These
call options have to be worth something, right? 30 calls.
I do think the chances are probably higher than perceived, but that doesn't help us if we're just trying to
What is Arc Raiders? Kapper's coming mid November. She didn't
slip. Did she say she slipped in the call? I don't think she slipped.
I'll wait years for Quantum. I don't give a [ __ ]
Meta is still down 12%. Yeah, they said mid November, but I don't think that was a slip or I understand it's a video
game. What kind of game is it? or I start losing my [ __ ]
Third person extraction shooter. How did that work? I guess I can look at
the game play. Man, I need a break from work, man. I'm
I'm getting pissed.
Oh, mid Q4 versus mid November. Yeah, I see.
Look at that Abbyax go.
Thank you. Uh I
Sorry guys, I do run a business here. Uh, strange action today. You know,
Nvidia got the best news they've ever gotten. Meta had a decent quarter. It's down 12%.
Google sort of the correct reaction I think. Microsoft very good quarter down
3%. It feels toppy to me.
Feels quite toppy to me. The quantum reaction is a little weird but that doesn't scare me because those stocks can drop 10% very quickly. It's the big
caps that, you know, really are uh
little worrisome. No, I I would like to buy Meta, but I also wonder if the market's going to [ __ ] So, if I buy
Meta, I'd have to short something in its place, like Apple. Apple seems like it could short. Apple's
really expensive. Yeah, we need plants. Uh,
I need I need an assistant um to water the plants. Get me coffee. If you're
interested in this, you got to send me your Instagram first. Chad Regetti has sold all his stock, my
man. Chad Regetti is a new company.
Don't speak on what you don't know. Don't [ __ ] speak on it. Chagrin is spelled C H A G- R I N. All right, I
think I have to pace a bit and think.
Okay, we're back.
Sporting anything is risky. Got to be prepared.
Got to be prepared for anything.
Oh yeah, Biohaven's a buy at any price. I hate to say that, but like Vlad's kind
of the goat, man. I don't know. Oh, I kind of want to buy it, but I don't want to get smacked when they if and when
they don't approve this drug. But kind of top news alert. US stocks S&P 500 NASDAQ
fall as meta spending plan spook investors. I don't know.
It's kind I hate to buy a little and then
you know what I mean? Buy a little now by buy by by after I get smashed. Oh, if
I like that. That seems like gambling to me.
But at the same time, I think everybody knows it's not going
to get approved or everyone expects it's not going to get approved and does have a chance of getting approved. So,
Quantum could is the kind of thing where it could be down very shortly.
Yeah. Basically the way you might want to use godell is you know that's top news. So you type top but let's say
you're into biioarma. So what you do is you type n
go to your watch list and do biioarma
just my watch list. And then I just turn on the speaker. And
depending on how much news you want, I have this filter set a certain way, but if I reset the filter, this will go off
pretty pretty frequently. Let me see if what filters I have.
I think it's got all sources. Yeah. So, is this BioParma? Bioarma.
Deepo fertilizers and petrochemicals is trading 1.05% lower with a volume of INR
472.1 million on Thursday, 30th of October.
liquid helium up.
Okay. So, we'll see what this looks like. But this is just bioarm menus from my
from this quote monitor. And then I can also try bofar menus from my second quote monitor
which is called bio2. I actually have three of them. BIO2 and BIO3.
And I could just turn all those on with audio so I know
if any of these
with a trading volume of USD 25 million MDRC trades 1.64% 64% lower today.
I'm short a lot more than that. Dian Luca,
well, you can get a similar username, Rio. I'm happy to give you a good one. I don't know if the free tier is TTS. I
don't think the free tier is TTS. No. You want You want it to have TTS? I could probably get some cheapo TTS
that's like really cheap. TTS costs money.
I don't know. A snack. I can't pronounce your name.
Dwave shows no signs of stopping. You fool. You fool.
Enron shows no signs of stopping. Media Prima BHD4502.KLO is trading 2.7% lower on Thursday 30th
of October and has a trading volume of MIR 13.8. That's a Malaysian stock.
Don't think I need that. I know I know about but that Nova Nordisk says offer for Metser
adheres to restrictions under Fizer deal. That's not a great tool.
On Thursday 30th of October, Goldman Sachs trades 1.14% lower.
You shorted the inverse.
Yeah, there's some cheaper models that we maybe we can give to our free users. I don't know.
We're going to make chat TTS as well. So, that's going to be pretty funny. And you you should be able to set your your
chat voice. I'll set mine to Trump. Yeah, there's a lot of different ways
you could do filters. You got to experiment with it. I think one thing we could do is make it so that you can save your presets, but there's a bunch of The
way we do filtering isn't great. The best way to do it is like just have
press releases and like well-known newswires because if you don't do that, you're going to get the like Ohio Daily
News and [ __ ] like that. Now, some users may want that, especially if they're like using this more as like a database
for news as opposed to a trader.
Yeah, MOP. We're working on that.
You can also type it in. I mean, you do it once, it's not that big of a deal, but I hear you.
Denerov, you're going to have to ask him on that one. On Thursday, 30th of October, astronaut
health trades 1.89% lower.
Yeah. Arkansas Daily News and tons of Pakistani news as well.
And I'm about to end this man's whole
career. [Applause]
I'm about to end this man's whole career.
Yeah, we're we're doing it, QW. Don't worry, we're on it.
But I'm not a rapper though.
Lattis Semiconductor LSCC is trading 2.84 print higher on Thursday 30th of October and has a trading volume of USD
210.2 million. I'm going to kill that one. Stock pulse.
Get the f out of here.
And I don't know if these are how these are bound. Like would this also okay this also excludes stock pulse.
So like that is good.
Yeah, we're racing GTA 6 for launch.
I'd say you need a good soundboard. It's critical. A lot of humor is found on the trading
desk.
Let's look at Taiwan semi real quick.
This is Q3 just reported I believe for September.
We're going to do this in new Taiwanese dollars. And let's see what they did. Big
numbers. Uh
I'm looking at totally wrong thing. I'm looking at the balance sheet. Health Secretary RFK Jr. says there's
not sufficient proof to show Tylenol causes autism. Okay, there you go. RFK is saying
Tylenol does not cause autism. So, Time 30% revenue growth.
CNBC 10:30 a.m. from 10:34 to 10:39 in US Central.
[ __ ] CNBC. CNBC is cold garbage.
Yeah, [ __ ]
246 84. Okay. 95202. Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. It's 739. other comprehensive income. I'll
probably exclude that.
That's a billion Taiwanese dollars. God damn. Health Secretary RFK Jr. says there's
not sufficient proof to show Tylenol causes.
We should probably add 11 labs just so people can
select it if they want it. Bring whatever TTS model you want.
Top midday stories. Trump she reached trade agreement. Meta shares tumble after analyst downgrades price target
cuts.
I'm not sure on Oracle.
I don't even know what you're saying, Jeff Smith. 99.9% strike rate plays. What is that?
I don't even know what that is. Yeah, Phil. Um, actually, we are just
about to close our round. I'm so used to saying yes, but I think our seed round is done. You're welcome
to email me anyway, martindl.software. Um, but I think we're moving to the
series A round at a much higher valuation. You guys have been awesome.
Thank you for making my company very valuable.
Um, I can't wait to watch the earnings. I don't know if what's going to happen.
I mean, everyone is surprised by Meta Meta's reaction.
I am going to stay long, Ser. I've not changed my mind.
Um, yeah, we we uh we had a low valuation, very very low. The future of biotech maintaining US
competitiveness in delivering life-saving cures to patients. Yeah, typically the uh valuation for a
startup is like 10 or 20 million for preede. That's where we were at. We we raised 2 million, doubled the valuation,
a little more than double actually, and raised five. We're going to probably have a press release out on that soon
and then uh probably go into series A in the nine digits valuation.
So, good stuff.
is to put the extra respect on it. That's what you needed to do.
I really need the Rizza as my advisor just to give occasional like, you know,
shout outs. Bring back Wuang Financial.
Wuang Financial.
Well, if you're not an accredited investor, you should do something else. Investing is probably
not for you. Yeah, at some point, Josh, I'm not really that nervous or worried about it.
For a lot of people, it's a big milestone. Breaking views. Obesity feeding frenzy risks queasy outcome.
A lot of uh People have that, oh, I need a billion. Nova Nordic said to make higher bid for
Met Sera to challenge Fizer Bloomberg news reports, but that's not the most important thing.
Locked in accounts should get award, and I think that'd be fun. My my co-workers and investors would not love that, but I
think we should I think we should do that. It would be funny. Do a bunch of legal work, complicate our
cap structure just for the lols.
Fake meat. Fake meat is done. It's over.
I don't hold trades too long, but I've been holding Guantanam forever.
The most pre This is why I bought the Wuang album. There's the whole reason.
The most see precious thing in the world. I don't understand what's wrong with my computer.
I'm streaming, but I have a 4090. Like, this should not happen, but it's really
frustrating. Turn to the graph, which is right. Do you see the
the frames per second is so low? Novo Nordis challenges Fiser with offer of up to 9 billion for Medsura.
Why do I have low frames per second? It's so [ __ ] dumb. Maybe I don't have acceler.

I I often will uh tweet, it's my joke, does anybody know a good bank to
diversify my bonds with? A good financial institution.
dividends expenses bonds.
Let's go.
Update one. Backter cuts annual profit forecast on persistent hurricane impact. Shares hit 20-year low.
Damn, Baxter's at a 20-year low. I might have to do something.
Might have to do something about that.
Is there a symbol for Taiwanese dollar? It looks like maybe a yen, I think.
Don't even know.
[Music] I got to make an FX section here.
Annoying.
Is it NTD? Is that the I thought it was TWWD now. Yeah, TWWD.
How about USD? TWWD $30.72
or 30 Taiwan.72.
Okay. So 1.3 trillion market cap for
Taiwan sent me 1.2 two trillion enterprise value.
Taiwan started in 1987 is actually something of a young company.
I've converted these to USD.
So, now do I have to convert these maybe to US back to USD for EPS?
Annoying, but I'll do it.
Maybe time on Sammy is the play.
I mean Taiwan semis 19 times
Lily exceeds expectations and raises its targets thanks to success of Mjaro and Zebound
the cheapest are Taiwan Semi
Berkshire which isn't growing and JP Morgan which is a bank so like on semi
still could be the winner.
I mean Taiwan semi margins are not bad
and the growth is there. I mean it's not Nvidia growth but it's not too far and
you know they got diversification with Apple and Apple and
Broadcom using them I think Google uses Broadcom right so Broadcom
makes A6
update one backer cuts annual profit forecast on persistent and hurricane impact shares hit 20-year low.
Yeah, I'm starting to look at those, Matthew. It's not my space. It's going to take me 10 years to really learn semiconductors. It's not a overnight
process, you know, and that would take deep dedications, which I don't have. Oh yeah, look at BTQ
disappear. Doing a disappearing act. Yeah, BTQ is going to zero, dude.
I don't know who who thought that was a good idea. meet six handle real soon.
Will Clint's profits in third quarter after earning 4.826 billion euros and raises forecast.
Well, you got to decide that, Mason. I give a whole video series on that. But yeah, basically debt is money you have
to pay back and cash is cash. Cash I'm also I also include stock, any kind of
stock a company has, investments, you know, to me that counts as well.
Why so much regretty
women folk healers were branded as witches, but their treatments may have been medically sound.
What AOC [ __ ] you say to me?
BTQ is just a fake company, dude. No revenue, nothing. They got nothing. Whole thing's a joke.
CNBC just uh I mean it really is just
like consensus thinking, consensus view. It's mostly a bunch of idiots. The
reporters have no experience. They never worked anywhere important or interesting.
They're often just somewhat good-looking people that kind of just are doing the reporter thing. You know,
they're journalists. They're not really subject matter experts.
Real finance is a lot more boring, but you know, they try to make it entertaining and that's
it's not it accomplishes neither to be frank.
a lot of advertisements. I mean, it's television at the end of the day. It's the worst of television
and it can lull you into thinking you're working, which obviously one is not. Okay, so 30% plus growth average 37%
year-over-year growth last six quarters for Taiwan semi. Really remarkable. Now, you could also see that reverse and
decline at some point and I think that's just going to
happen someday. Yeah, Becky, that's Warren's favorite.
Premarkets down on questions. Fed juds in Q3 earnings.
BMY beats on Q3 earnings and sales raises 2025 sales view.
Novo nor disguise rival takeover of Metzero with up toight dollar.50 bid bid. say that payments may not be paid

I'm not dead yet.
[ __ ] is this [ __ ] quantum rally?
It's pissing me off.
EV is enterprise value. Is this your first day?
It's your first [ __ ] day. You're a grand [ __ ] noob.
No, I don't text you. You probably need a better better software. What What
software told you BTQ's market cap was was 5 million? Who told you that?
What system are you using? Look at this dumb [ __ ] right here. Everybody, I don't text 9783.
What dumb [ __ ] system are you using? Huh? Market cap's only 5 million. Oh, then go
buy the whole [ __ ] company. Stupid [ __ ] Market cap's only 5
million.
Oh, I don't I'm looking it up. Oh, Trading View. Oh yeah,
market cap's 5 million. Derp,
you might want to try a real system, my man. It's a steel. The float must be so
small.
Yahoo Finance has the right number, 1.1 billion.
Google shows no market cap at all. Unbelievable.
Look at that bare flag, guys.
Yeah, futures are slowly rolling out in goodell.
Oh, you think trading you? So, you think it's a 5 million market cap?
That's good. You're doing good. You're doing good for yourself.
It's good. Trust trust trust what you see. You're doing excellent
tabs. Tab folders or scrollable tab list. I'm not sure what you're asking. Veil.
We have tabs on the bottom. Like if you mean like this like changing
tabs.
It's kind of an interesting way to do it. Let me
What? What does that mean? Need more tabs? I don't understand what you're saying.
There's tabs on the bottom. Yeah, trading view is a few billion.
Oh, you want banan? You want to ban? I don't text. Oh, that's what you're
asking for. I got you. No problem.
I love banning idiots. It's my favorite thing.
So, you want how many tabs do you want? Because you can make a monitor three and
you can put this on your on your other monitor, right? Okay. You want a fourth tab? Monitor
four. So, what you you run how do you run out of tabs?
How many tabs do you need?
Uh, Yousef, stop [ __ ] spamming my chat.
I don't care about your [ __ ] $20 account.
Oh my god, look at this idiot.
Yeah, thank you, Islanders.
Listen, guys. If you're going to type to me, I need complete sentences,
proper [ __ ] grammar. Stop being an idiot.
Yeah. Um, let me look into that, Andre. That's a good question.
Yeah. Yeah, we are working on that veil for sure.
Rough rough stuff.
Can you explain the Excel sheet where you list a lot of companies? Well, basically it's an Excel sheet with a lot
of companies.
Sometimes you guys really get on my [ __ ] nerves. Did you
know that? Get my last [ __ ] nerves.
I'm going to take it out on my cat when I get home.
Come here.
The GitHub link is github.com
Martinrelli. You could also Google Martini GitHub and get the same link.
What brokers do you deal with for futures in your software, Martin?
Well, we're financial information company, so we don't deal with brokers. We deal with exchanges.
I hope that answers your [ __ ] question you've asked me 600 times.
Damn.
Oh, he's asking it again. And Andy's adding me. What's wrong with this guy?
Don't make jokes though, saying, "I'll ban you. I will ban you if you sit there sarcastically joking, piling on." Cuz
you know why? Cuz it's it's getting to my head. It's driving me [ __ ] crazy.
core. I mean, just the the business of buying GPUs, plugging them in, and
renting them is it's not easy to do. I couldn't do it, but
it's hard to for me to imagine that's the biggest company in the world, you know. Um,
and the market cap of Cory is really high. Now, again, I'm not the expert in that business. So, I know people who do
it, but it's a very tedious business and it's not a
it's not that profitable of a business, you know? It's not it's not a cash gusher, but at the same time, you have
this like weird dynamic
Have I been mixing up inventories 5925
and vendor trade receivables non-trade receivables?
H concerning. Highly concerning.
Yeah, I think there is a planned obsolescence, right? I mean, that's part of being a data vendor. I'm sorry, a
compute vendor. You're going to have machines go obsolete. That's natural. I don't think that's a
big problem, right?
Tim, it's Buffett. Yeah. Listen, Tim, how do you think I could get through the line like that?
Tim. Tim, I'm calling for Tim Cook for Buffett. Yeah, put put him on the line. Yeah, Tim
calling from Omaha. What's up? Listen,
that thing we've been talking about. Yeah, wire the money to this account. Okay. Yeah, I need a bill. Okay. Yeah,
wire it over here. You know what I'm talking about. Just wire it. Give me the money.
Need about a billion. send over a billion to his crypto account. Okay,
Mr. Cook. Yeah. Yeah. Put M put Cook put him on the
line. Yeah. There's Warren Buffett from Bergkshire
halfway. Not playing with you, [ __ ] Put him online.
Bring bring me your cherry coke over. Okay.
Yeah. I'm sorry. Uh there's Tim there.
Yeah. I recently got into crypto. They need you to buy this uh shitcoin. I mean burkser bergkercoin.
I just created it. That'd be great if Apple could support it and put it on Apple Pay.
It's my dying wish.
Bring Becky. Bring Becky. I like that ass.
You know I tap that ass.
Show her what Omaha's all about.
Yeah, Munger had a coin, too.
Munger love crypto. It was just talking [ __ ]
Man, the the Apple buybacks are a little embarrassing to be honest,
but I guess you know that we lived in a anti- merger world, so
Yo, what's up, man? How you feeling?
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me know if I could do anything.
It's funny how capex for Apple isn't growing at all. Tim Cook's just like, "Fuck all you guys buying all those
GPUs. I ain't doing that shit." [ __ ] that. Charlie. Charlie hit it first
and then I hit it sec second. I'm so pissed about that [ __ ]
Why Charlie get to hit it first? I'm Warren Buffett, not him.
[ __ ]
We all tapped that ass. The whole board of directors. Whole board hit it.
Yeah, I'm still short quantum. Nice and painful.
I can look at our cutest
a Becky quick buffet. That was just Yeah,
it was great.
I mean, Charlie make a hell of a team.
I don't know if Birks will drop or not if Warren Buffett when Warren Buffett passes away, but you know, guy's a
absolute legend. Best that ever did it by far.
I've had like three or four home runs and mostly biotech that
Quantum's eaten up, but Quantum dropped from the top. I mean, we were short eye on Q at 80 and Regetti. Did what Regetti
hit? Did Regetti hit like almost 60?
Wrong wrong chart. Yeah, almost hit 60. I was ready to jump
out the window. I made a I made this Post-it note, which I'm never going to have to use again. This marked the top.
Put this Post-it note right here. Bag holder. I tweeted it and that was it.
All I just had to do is accept defeat without without
changing my positions. But yeah, I had Spruce, I had Abbyax, I
had so many biotech winners.
Inmune, ATYR, non-stop W after W.
and it just kept crushing me. And finally, you know, it broken through.
But maybe maybe I'll give it all back again. We'll see if it if if Quantum
goes back to its old highs. If IQ's at 80 and Regetti hits 60 and D-Wave, god
forbid, hits anything higher, you'll see me back to break even. It's happened many times. Three times I hit I think
triple digits back to zero. Worst I was down 60%.
I didn't hit practice. And I actually should have some home runs coming up. Yeah.
Should we see leverage? Nobody. And then having a
stock that went up 10x. Spruce went up 10x.
That was pretty sick. like 8x.
Well, price to sales is not relevant for biotech because if you don't have revenue for your biotech, then what's
the point?
I don't know how Seramus is going to really roll out for SEPTA. I think it's a little more complicated than that.
I rarely use stops because I'm I just don't trade that way. You know, when I
I'll use stops for large cap stocks that I don't, you know, have a
a good edge on. But if I have an edge, I don't I don't really use stops. I think I have an edge.
Uh quantum's, you know, largely my almost not my whole portfolio, but yeah, it's it's a good majority of my
portfolio. I don't think a majority of investors are bullish on Quantum. I that's that's
not how every stock is owned by somebody,
right? So that's not the way I would look at it.
Unless you can survey every investor something. Well,
yeah, my private portfolio is more or less the same [ __ ] Slight slight variations, but nothing too crazy.
Yeah, I think I'm going to going to aos snack.
I don't know anything about the cassava momentum. I'm not really watching that. That was kind of a dog [ __ ]
dog [ __ ] stock. I don't know the joke of the day what I
would do at that point, but I don't think it's going to happen.
No, IBM doesn't have [ __ ] There's no bond trading algorithm. That
was all fake.
Yeah, Matteo, I do. Volume is rebounding as we speak. Well,
that's why my portfolio is dropping. I was at 200K. Now I'm at 170K. That's 400
to 300%. Soon I'll be in the 200s.
I spent my whole life on it. 5879.
Yeah, I have no decision on ZW uh on on RevD RVMD, but
it's hard to say.
Are there any publicly traded PBMs? I don't think so.
Very excited for an OpenAI IPO.
Oh yeah. Did you see my shirt? Oh.
Just a lot of experience. Reap
Yeah. Well, it's not a trial exactly.
I don't really I mean price target doesn't that doesn't really I don't even
really know what that is. I mean I think
the company's worth a lot more than what it's trading at. But there's a it's kind of constantly moving kind of
idea depending on what the news is at any given moment.
But I think it's pretty undervalued.
Yeah, the HSBC thing was debunked as fake.
Very fake.
Sorry live I don't Tyabri maybe London I think London would be our
European headquarters but it could be in Germany London's kind of dissipating.
of Frank Frankfurt.
That sucks, Joe. Try again later. Sounds like you got owned.
Um, I'm not sure what we need in Europe. Probably at the very least sales.
Yeah, Poland's great.
wherever there's the most traders and hedge funds and London has quite a lot of them.
I don't know. Need just need for speed. Whatever makes you comfortable, I guess.
Maybe joke. I don't know.
massive capex increase for Meta.
Zuck was like, "Well, if we buy too many computers, if Meta buys too many computers, we'll
just sell them. I mean, who gives a [ __ ]
Here at Meta, we're building the future.
And the future is you're going to give me your money.
Smoked
meats are the future. Beyond meat,
me and Bill Gates are investing in these smoked meats.
I'm bullish on the stock that I said I was bullish on that would go to 300. I'm still bullish.
I didn't change my mind.
Yeah. Terms of Yeah. How do I have the timmerity to deal with this
answering the same question every day? Sometimes I surprise myself.
I've literally answered that question many times. E, no snack. So, you're really getting my nerves.
That's the type of [ __ ] that makes me not want to stream anymore, asking me the same question over and over and over again.
No, I'm going to decrease my position as we get close to the binary event that I'm preparing months and months for. I
want to I want to exit
I don't want a spicy Discord. Why do I want to interact with hoes?
Who Who wants to interact with them hoes? I'm on thought patrol. [ __ ] that.
[ __ ] that.
All you kids, you can have the hose now. I'm done. I'm done. I'm retired.
I saw some hoes the other night. I was out with wifey and my son. I said, "See, see son, one day those hoes are for
you." And he was crying and the hoes are like, "Oh, he's so cute." I was like, "Son,
that's what I'm telling you.
Get ready for a lot of that.
If NEG got gets up enough, I'll short it. Is it up? I don't think NEG terrible ticker by the
way. Imagine, you know, if the Beyond Meat people, the GameStop people have a name for them themselves. What do you
think the NEG neg community calls themselves?
Beyond meters, you got the GameStopers. You've got Open Door Army.
Micro Strategists.
So, Apple's retaken the number two enterprise value from Mr. Softy.
It's amazing. Bergkshire's not even top 10 biggest companies. Crazy, huh?
And the top seven are tech.
Top eight, nine. Top 10. Top nine are tech. It's a Mag 9.
The nifty nine. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Broadcom, Meta, Tesla, and Taiwan Semi.
Then you got some boring companies. Nine big tech.
5 trillion for Nvidia, 4 trillion for Apple, almost 4 trillion for Microsoft,
three and a half trillion for Alphabet, Google, 2 and a half trillion for Amazon, almost two trillion for
Broadcom, almost two trillion for Meta, one half trillion for Tesla,
one and a quarter trillion for Taiwan Semi.
Did I see a Bloomberg article about that? My My brother, I live this. I know more about that stuff than the
Bloomberg people do. I ain't reading no Bloomberg article. Come on, man. Who do you think I am, man? Who do you think
this is? It's Big Skrey. Come on, baby. You know me.
You know what I do? I'm a big dog.
You don't have longs on any AI stocks. That is not the right grammar.
How many times do I have to teach you guys if you want to ask that question? Are you long on any AI stocks? Are you
long any AI would have been the right way to say that? No, I'm blocked from
seeing Shay's tweet. Shai's tweets. He's he's banned me from his Twitter. I'm
don't know what I'm going to do without that insight.
blocked. Take that.
That was a little rough. I was a little mad. I like that he was googling during the
or chatting with chat GBT trying to learn about the sector he liked.
What do you think about this? What do you think about that? Come on, man.
Just just admit you like the word quantum. Just admit it.
It's a cool ass word, man. I'll I'mma give you that.
Don't sit here acting you're like Einstein, bro. Come on. I'm not either. Do a little bit. You got to do a little
bit of work, bro. Tiny bit. Just a little.
Please read on
more short capper. That's about all I got to say about that. Wow, look at BTQ.
Oh, look at Lays though. CLSQ. What a fake [ __ ] company.
What a garbage company.
Yeah, Broadcom has no property plan equipment. So, is Broadcom just going to TSM?
They designed the chip. They're fabulous. We have a saying in my Discord called
Quiddless for the Brits.
What's spar? What's your confidence level in copper not working? I mean, spend five minutes of diligence on it
yourself. You tell me.
uh opt and Oman I think are the same pneummonic. Yeah,
just Oman is the Bloomberg version. So, but it's the same thing. But some people
remember Oman from like Bloomberg. So they'll it's backwards
compatible
man. This chart for Getty. What does this chart say, guys? What are
you What are you reading to this triple top right here? Quadruple top.
And then the hammer drops. Bam. That's a Head and Shoulders if I've ever
[ __ ] seen one. Am I right or am I right? Is that a Head and Shoulders?
Is that not Head and Shoulders.
Tell me that ain't no Head and Shoulders, man. It's a weird Head and Shoulders, too.
supposed to be breaking down but it's not camel get the camel pattern
I don't even know what is it delayed head and shoulders
rising dogee head and shoulders no dandruff
no dandruff
Is it a head and shoulders? I don't know. I don't think so cuz the second shoulder doesn't look so
it's like a I guess it is a head and shoulder
Shampoo. It's all about shampoo.
Oh, Nana is public. Navan
I wonder about broadcast man.
I'd rather buy I'd rather buy Taiwan semi. Maybe long Taiwan semi short broadcast.
try not to teddy but occasionally if it's bioarma I'll look but I won't
look if it's not biofarma that's the space I know Oh,
what just happened here?
Damn. Haven't tried Graipedia yet.
Google's not even rising.
Oh. That's what happened here.
Yeah, Reuters is used. I mean, Reuters is now called Lseg Workspace,
so it's not really Reuters anymore. Reuters is just sort of a used pure play now.
I don't know who some of these people are. Reefs
don't know that name.
Yeah, we should do that. Sounds like a really good idea.
Give me a moment.
Come on. I need quantum to burn. Burn, shorty, burn.
Make sure you check out godell terminal.com. $83 million of users have connected
their brokerages. That's really cool. Thank you guys for your support.
All-time high new user growth. We're just we're just crushing it, man.
We're just crushing it.
Yeah. So, I guess if I had to pick which which of these stocks I like or don't like.
Huh, this is tricky.
I definitely think the worst is Apple.
Well,
Apple's definitely one of the worst. I'll say that.
Apple's a tricky one. Probably don't understand it enough.
But yeah, the fact that they're not investing very much in AI is kind of interesting.
That's kind of the the Apple way in some ways.
It's sort of also consensus kind of hated stock. It's kind of like what Google was like six months ago.
I kind of dislike Avago or Broadcom. A little bit bearish maybe there.
See Amazon. Amazon's actually pretty good, I think,
even though they kind of dropped the ball on GPUs a little
being a good GPU cloud. Or maybe Nvidia didn't want them to be a good cloud.
Google's probably one of the trickiest ones. It's probably fine.
Microsoft's also extremely tricky.
Nvidia is also very tricky. I'd probably say I invid I liked in
Nvidia the most just because they they have this like
insatiable demand.
Tesla is one of the hardest. So, you have no idea what to expect with Elon.
He's just like a superhero comic, you know, character. You don't know if
he keeps you hanging, you know. You don't know if it's all going to fall apart or he rides in at the end as a hero. He
seems to always figure it out.
It's not much of an update on Quantum.
Um, definitely doing some investigating into some interesting P new papers, but
nothing too exciting. Just waiting for the next quarter.
I'm just going by largest market caps in the world. This isn't a portfolio that I have.
This is literally the world's largest market caps.
Yeah. So, yeah, with Optimus, I don't I It's hard to trust Optimus,
man. I mean, I think I think he's going to pull through in the end.
Teslas are great cars, man. They're really great cars.
I don't know. Common sense. We, you know, and they're all like created somewhat differently, right? Like I feel
like QUBt and QBTs are going to be more sensitive to earnings than Regetti and I on Q,
but I don't know.
Tesla energy. I think most people are excited about robo taxi and Optimus.
Hard to bet against Elon, but I don't know. I would just say neutral.
That would be diplomatic. Um,
but yeah, let me fill out some of my Tesla. I didn't uh do a good job with
these.
I think bulls, some bulls for quantum will assume that they're going to get
results someday, right? I mean, if it doesn't happen anytime soon, then
they're they're going to get, you know, kind of despondent. It may take more quarters. But if they
say things like, well, you know, if they say we're going to have a thousand cubits next month, that's bullish.
But if they say, well, we might have 100 cubits next month. IMQ still has only released 39 cubits.
So, like when the hell is the next machine out and how many cubits is going to be? And
if they say it's only 100, then a big [ __ ] deal. IBM's had a 150 for last year, maybe longer. I should make a list
of that.
Yeah, energy has been going up for Tesla and services. So, is this record revenue for Tesla?
You listen to all the people on Twitter. You think that Tesla's stopped growing?
But is that is that record revenue?
record vehicle deliveries, record revenue, and record free cash flow. Yeah, no need to. These guys,
those guys are acting like Tesla's, you know, dropping quite a lot.
Haters, you a [ __ ] hater.
self-driving in addition to
it's a great car.
Optimus Mega Pack 3.
Yeah. I mean, they're running the business just fine. I thought I thought this guy was falling the way the shorts are [ __ ] talking.
Well, you don't need a reason to short a stock. It could just be very overvalued.
You know, if somebody said, "You want to buy this $100 bill for a million dollars?"
Would you say yes? Because you need you need a reason. Sometimes things are just expensive.
You say, "No, thank you. Kiss my ass.
Tesla also has like no debt. They could easily take on debt
and a lot of the other companies are taking on debt to buy GPUs. Elon's PP&E
He's not He's not buying many GPUs. So, I wonder when Elon becomes a big
capex. He's really not buying much of any. He's bought at least a Tesla and XAI. I think
he is, but Tesla's added three billion in capex. And that can't even be half even half
GPUs, I don't think.
79 976 87. This is Tesla.
I'm just updating. Nothing too heavy.
Well, XAI is its own company, so it's not a spin. They can't spin it out. It's
property of XAI. It's a different company.
Yeah, it's a good question, Brandon. There's a lot of uh law on that. So, there's a proper way to
do it. Proper. It's a proper way. It's proper
for the Brits in the house. He's [ __ ] proper proper brother
stuff. Proper baby stuff.
Always joke that my baby's British cuz he's uh I always joke that he's a
British rockstar and he's drunk on milk all the time. It's just got bottles of milk lying around.
Were you on the sauce again? Supposed to go on in two hours.
Here you are. Wasted, passed out. Milk everywhere.
Get it together, bro.
Yeah, catalysts are kind of fake fake idea if you think about it.
Someone answer. I think somebody knocked on the door.
Yeah, catalysts are kind of like this fictitious idea that the market will
decide or create like
who was it? Ghosts.
Oh, really? Bastard [ __ ] everybody up.
Listen, bro. Well, I would say I like Goodell terminal because um it is gives me
access to things that I can't get in any other system and it really understands that Wall Street is a social place. So,
if I want to look up other people on the buy side or sell side, I can do that on Goodell or it just feels like those
other systems don't like they're made for people who live in a basement and don't talk to Wall Street.
And that's not me. I don't want to be a loser. So, that's why I use Goodell.
Try it now for free.
I feel like a lot of these systems are not even made for people who trade because like if you
look at news, a lot of these systems don't really have the right news all the time.
It's frustrating. I want as much news per ticker as possible. I don't want to guess as to
whether or not my system has news or not. I'll pay for the certainty. I needed to have every news wire cuz what
happens if I miss the news? Can't trade like that. It's frustrating.
[Music]
Pick up the phone. Call now 1800.
I don't even need news. Mang is gay.
I closed all my positions before 4:00. [ __ ] the news.
I need my news feeds to be customizable.
If I want Hindi news, I should be able to get that. If I want news in German, my whole feed
should be German. I can do that with God. I can't do that with any other system.
Tesla's pretty expensive. I ain't going to lie. Tesla's uh little
expensive.
Goodell is a prof, you know, it's a professional platform made by professionals. A lot of the other platforms out there,
you can just tell they're not made by people that actually trade.
You know, I want to I want something that's made for professional Wall Street people, not for retail, designed with
retail in mind. I want the things that Wall Street uses to make decisions. That's why I use Goodell.
Don't treat me like a baby. You know, I've got a lot of money and I want the best tool possible.
Bloomberg won't even take my call. And I know that the other tools out
there are just made for people with tiny amounts of money. If I'm a sophisticated investor, then I need sophisticated
tools.
Well, Bloomberg's $25,000 a year and it has the same command line system as Godell. It's backwards compatible. But I
don't want to pay $25,000 a year and lock myself in for two years. That's why I turned to Kodell. It's a
much better solution.
I don't know why they named it Kodell. It's some mathematician guy, I think. But
I don't really worry about all that. Probably some dorks from Jane Street.
Bloomberg has the worst emotes.
Bloomberg looks like it was made in 1983. Oh, wait. It was
Girdle Pascals is my next company probably
or Oiler or Gwa or Couchi
or Leandra or Erdish
Erdish.
baggie.
One of our devs was like, "I don't know how to short anything.
Look at all these worthless companies. Most companies are worthless. That's the thing nobody gets.
Lelass Fouchy. Fouchy LLC. Named after the
greatest doctor of all time.
Yeah, I was trying to figure out what a good bag holder costume would look like. Beyond Meat, Open Door, GameStop, like a
You'd have to put in everything. Little bit of everything.
Yeah, Bloomberg is a bit of a mess there. Yeah. Do they I mean they have docs kind of, but yeah, the API is like
they don't want you to use the API. The API is like a demo for you to buy more
API from them. And it's like not even a big business for them. They should just let people use it.
So stupid.
Yeah, drug pharmacy dude.
Yeah, it's it's a mess. I we're we're going to make an API product
at some point soon, but you know, to your point, I mean, if you're going to do it, you got to do it right.
And yeah, I mean, we use APIs from a lot of the main players and it's not a lot
better anywhere else. I gotta say, it's not really designed for developers
like in the modern kind of stack. It's sort of designed like for the old
enterprise kind of thing. new philosophy of like having always
updated docs like you got developer relations [ __ ] like that you know what
they do in SF they're not doing here in New York that's an opportunity
What's INTS? I never heard of it.
Yeah, they want to sell Bquant which is you know this you know basically Jupyter notebook
thing. Not all quants use Jupyter notebooks by the way and there there there other issues. Yeah.
How do you how do you get get comput? I mean, it's another problem. You don't want
Bloomberg provisioning your freaking compute.
Yeah, I never heard of them. Sorry.
Oh, you liked it. Thanks, Copes.
Ammy [ __ ] as the wonder drug for obesity. What? Who said that? Is that your opinion?
That's your opinion, right? I think GLP is the wonder drug for obesity. I don't think anybody thinks
Semaglutide babyide.
The [ __ ] you talking about? Talking some [ __ ]
Yeah, reiter tide with, you know, we'll have to see.
I I don't know much about inhibi. We'll see.
It's too early.
Uh yeah, it's gonna Yeah.
[Music]
Yeah, it's a salmon one.
Oh, wow. That's great, Kaiser. Yeah, I didn't check it out. That's awesome. That's huge. Love it.
That brings a smile to my face. I'm so tired. You guys care if I take a
nap?
I need a better diet or something. I don't care for cars. Not really a car
guy.
I have much more interest in weed. I stay high every day basically.
I don't know if you guys knew that, but it's true. Smoke a lot of weed. The vids
basically every day. Now that I have this baby, it's really stressful. So, I
smoke him up, too. Smoking, blow the weed, smoke in his face, get him used to it. You know what
I mean? He catching a contact.
Not my fault. He in the room. [ __ ] I didn't have the baby. He showed up one day. Smoke
every day. You don't like it? [ __ ] you.
Start him young. That's how I get the patience, man. Otherwise, I couldn't deal with this
[ __ ]
Smart, right? Get him used to that [ __ ]
That's why I got galaxy gas under my desk
just in case I got to take a quick hit. GG.
GG and twin. They call me Unk at work. I don't know
why what that means. Unk.
What [ __ ] you mean? You smart.
If I study high and then take the test high, I'll get the high score. I like
that. No, I've never taken creatine. Maybe I should. I just have such low energy. But
you know what it is? I don't get vitamin B or vitamin D or um iron. So, those are the three things you kind of need. This
thing is vitamin B. Yeah. 80% vitamin B12 and B6.
Sunglasses. I used to go hide to school. I didn't
give a [ __ ] The [ __ ] they gonna say you high? I'm going say no. What the
[ __ ] you talking about? High. I ain't get no sleep last night. I was studying too hard.
Now, if you'll excuse me. I got to get high.
What are you going to do? Kick me out of school?
A lot of people wonder, Skrey, why didn't you get a PhD? Why don't you get a medical degree? Now you know the
reason. Now you know the reason.
I know. But too much red meat is terrible for you, but not getting iron is terrible for you. God damn it. What
do I do?
Amalin's been around a long time. Amalin's not that strong. There is a
company called Amalin, a drug called Simlin.
You might want to look into it. obliterated.
I can't [ __ ] think straight, bro. That's what I need.
How am I supposed to do this calculus? I can't, man. Teacher, I can't do this
calculus right now, man. Come on, man. [ __ ] high as [ __ ] High as [ __ ]
You mean derivative? Now, I was kind of a bad student in high
school just because I was upset with
upset with life,
bro. You're not black. Okay. Yeah, I I I actually have come to terms with that.
I will I will admit it. I admit it. That's true.
Then why speak Ebonics? Well, um
uh I don't know. Look, man, I'm from New York. We do things a little differently
over here. You know, you ever talk to a guy with a
New York accent and he's, you know, it's like, why you talk like that? New York.
Same thing. Guys in Boston talk differently, too. They just all talk a little differently, right?
Just Albanian at the end of the day.
Yeah, that's not somebody's natural voice, you know, they they adopt adopt that voice for whatever reason.
Guys in jail the same way, take on these crazy tones like,
you know, that's not your natural voice, but you've adopted a character. And part
of my job on stream here is to adopt a character so that you are entertained
and you pay me money. Understand? Good.
Now make with the money. Where else?
How do people in San Francisco talk? Um, well, that's an orthogonal uh point
of view. It's not clear that uh it's relevant to the discussion at
hand. This conversation hasn't found PMF yet
and I'm going to have to um get back to you.
Oh,
um, AGI is coming.
Can't do a V vocal fry. I think AI is going to be here soon, but
my voice is giving out before then. It's No, seriously. It's a really big
problem I have.
Yeah, I was going to do some standup. I I I actually rented out Webster Hall, which is like a mid, you know, midsized
event space here in New York. I was going to sell tickets. It was going to be more like a not like a comedy thing
really, but like you know just a show basically. It's like Jordan Peterson goes on tour. I can go on tour.
I'm smarter than Jordan Pet Jordan Peterson. And yeah, basically
Webster Hall like shut down the At first they rented it to me and then they're like, "Yeah, no, we we can't do this.
We're going to refund you this. We're getting a lot of complaints already,
man. [ __ ] you.
[Music]
Why does it say Q1?
I get my comp sheet right. Comp sheet stands for comparables.
Now you know for the future.
Okay. So Walmart really is 37 times earnings. Like WTF
Walmart's not growing, bro. What the [ __ ] market is this? What What market are we in that Walmart's
37 times? Come on, man.
Feel like Joe Biden. Come on, man. Come on, man.
It's Joe Biden. Come on. Come on.
What is this? What are What's doing here?
Yeah, I don't know, man. Google's at 25 times and is growing. Walmart's at 37
times. It's not growing. If I'm going to buy something that's not
growing, I give me some Berkshire. Give me some Bergkshire Hathway
or like freaking Taiwan Semi. at 19 times.
Meta at 22 times. Meta's got, you know, a decent strategy
for AI, even if they're a little behind, I guess.
Yeah, I like Amazon. The reason I like Amazon is Amazon's
earnings are obscured. Like Amazon could be twice as profitable. So, it's really trading at like 15 times
and growing, but they they hide a That was Bezos's move, man. They hide a lot of their earnings. Microsoft does that,
too. But I think Amazon hides more
They spend money on things that they believe are good returns, but they
double double as earnings extra spending.
So they can reduce that spending when the time comes.
Sometimes called earning smoothing. Microsoft did a lot of this.
You could smooth smooth revenue too if you really wanted.
I wouldn't suggest it. That's a fast ticket to jail.
Yeah, I like I like meta
Shout out to Zentani,
right?
You don't want to do too much earning smoothing.
How funny was Sia last night? The fleet of funible GPUs.
That's a pretty big position, Jipper. Thanks, man.
It's very important that our cloud fleet is funible
and Microsoft takes the lead in funible fleet
GPUs.
Yeah, something like 5 10% is good. You know, you shouldn't lose sleep on it. If you're losing sleep on it, your
position's too big.
Meanwhile, Abbyax 105 almost. Let's go.
I'm voting for mom Donnie. Yes, that's right. Why wouldn't I?
My bad, guys. My bad.
Comrades, I think uh AOC introduced him on the
stage as comrade. Just like, excuse me, do you say comrade? You know, my parents
fled communist Albania to come here to New York and now you're talking comrade.
Are you [ __ ] nuts?
Yeah. Sorry, that that one's always a little louder than expected.
But you know, you should be awakened to the possibility of
go back to Albania or wherever you came from, you [ __ ]
Um, you're not being inclusive right now. You have to be inclusive.
Even to terrorists, you have to be inclusive. If they're not inclusive, it's a
problem. We're going to cancel you.
Excuse me. not being inclusive to the terrorists needs.
I'm a queer Muslim
and I know what I'm talking about and you don't. Albanians are really people of color at
the end of the day. The Albanians are are pretty white
pretty much.
How does Visa grow, man?
Visa's got the only company with 98% gross margins,
70% operating margin. They don't even [ __ ] try to obscure earnings. How could they?
They couldn't do it if they wanted to.
They spend more on their their audit spend running their service.
Yeah, I love Dasha.
It's like the greatest business ever. Yeah, they are power addicts. I agree.
That's really a really good way to put it. And I think like next time I get to really give them a
piece of my mind. That's what I'm going to mention that like you guys think I'm addicted to capitalism and wealth. Well, you guys
are addicted to power. Like you'll say whatever it takes to be in power. You just want to be in charge of [ __ ]
You're some nerd in high school. Never got to be in charge of [ __ ] So now you're like, "No, I'm in charge."
Hall monitor.
We do need more monopolies. We actually don't have any monopolies. I
don't know if you understand this, but like very few companies get to last that long.
It's a very competitive world out there. On the top today, gone tomorrow.
Tax me harder. Mom, Donnie,
the biggest company in the world didn't exist 20 years ago. What kind of [ __ ] monopoly is that?
Literally the biggest here are the biggest companies in the world.
This one, let's see how old they are.
32 years old, 50 years old for Apple and Microsoft, 27 years old for Google, 31
years old for Amazon, 34 years old for Broadcom, only 21 years old for Meta, 22
years old for Tesla, 38 for Taiwan Semi. All these companies are
[ __ ] brand new. 63 for Walmart, 60 for Bergkshire,
67 for Visa. Visa is a monopoly, but Visa will uh
US Steel is almost went bankrupt. Certainly not a monopoly. Foreign companies beat them to shreds.
JP Morgan, now JP Morgan is an interesting story because it only became a big bank recently. Eli Liy, same
thing. 150 years old, but only became a big pharma, the biggest pharma recently through competitive success, not through
monopol monopolism. 10 cent, brand new company practically. Oracle 50 years old
and these are founder led. If it's more than 50 years old, it's founderled.
You know, that means the the boss who started it is just really good at at capitalism.
Netflix 28 just 28 years old. Mastercard 59 years old. Okay, here's the next one.
18 and 19th. Literally open AI. How could you be a monopoly when you just
started your company? It's 10 years old. Literally 10 years
old. Look how crazy that is. 10 years old.
Deutsche Bank was never the biggest bank. SpaceX 23 years old. They just started
the thing.
Costco 42 years old. Okay. Proctor and Gamble 188 years old. Proctor is a
consumer products company. You could argue it's it's a monopoly. There's one
out of these top 21 companies. I would say is somewhat monopolistic.
No, but the point is monopolies theoretically are the most valuable companies. The most valuable companies
is not a monopoly in sight.
Okay, here's here's, you know, one uh Johnson and Johnson,
but again did not become a huge company until somewhat recently.
SAP, relatively new company. Home Depot, relatively new. Abbott Labs, you know,
been around forever, but again, never was really a gigantic company until they they grew recently.
Alibaba, you know, brand new [ __ ] company, basically 26 years old.
Coca-Cola, large successful company, but certainly not Monopoly. I mean, you can you can drink whatever soda you feel
like. No, no luxury company is a monopoly. Even though Hermes was founded 200 years
ago, it ain't no monopoly. Now, United Health, that's somewhat monopolistic.
Telecom companies are somewhat monopolistic in the sense that they're, you know, um they have key
infrastructure. Palunteer,
you know, practically brand new.
Samsung again, family-led. LVMH, not a monopoly. You don't have to drink Hennessy.
Novo Nordisk, you know, had, you know, I wouldn't say monopoly in insulin, but, you know, they had had a strong position in insulin for a long time.
How about Quao? We chai think it's almost brand new company.
Okay. Philip Morris bit of a monopoly but you know tobacco is not actually
hard to grow but you know a bit of a monopoly. ASML brand new company. Salesforce brand
new company.
Nestle old company. Bit of a monopoly there. I'll hand it to them. Toyota
unbelievably successful company. Not not a new company, but the best car company,
you know, in many ways uh in terms of uh the their
operating ro but only successful recently thanks to
their brilliant acquisition of Janentech.
I think you know you're you're not wrong about the tobacco companies but in a lot of ways I mean I guess you can't start a
new tobacco company so that sort of becomes a de facto monopoly and then again the telecom companies are kind of
have to be monopolies in a way um
but yeah no nothing where you have a big consumer choice like McDonald's isn't you know isn't a monopoly You don't have
to eat at McDonald's.
Cisco, like still relatively new company. Here's a good one actually. L'Oreal. In
a lot of ways, L'Oreal is a is a monopoly. You don't have to use their makeup, but women have to use some
makeup. At least that's sort of the civilization standards. And
you know, there really aren't too many makeup companies and they buy a lot of other makeup companies. IBM
has changed their business so many times it's hard to call them monopoly.
Uh Lindy is complicated story so you could argue. Reliance,
GE, very tough one to parse there. Merc certainly not a monopoly because it was
founded, US MC was founded relatively recently. The original Merc
was founded, you know,
a long long time ago.
So, you could you could argue that certainly not no drug company is a monopoly. You're only as good as the
last drug you make. AT&T is probably the one true monopoly that ever existed if you had to pick one.
Yeah, some of these companies are brand new. Service Now is as valuable as American Express. Think about how crazy
that is.
Yeah, I I don't have energy companies in here. Obviously, some of the energy companies have monopolistic features for
sure, but I think the illustration here is that, you know, innovation seems to be more important than anything.
Verizon, you know, is sort of original AT&T. So
you actually can put down a lot of companies that's coming from the original
AT&T. But even Intel, you know,
DH was probably founded well before that. But and Goldman didn't become a major player
until well
into it was also founder for a long time. Goldman basically Mr. Goldman and Mr. Sachs actually failed the company
until 1930. Was kind of bought out by Sydney Weinberg, I believe.
Well, USPS is government company. It's not It's not a monopoly. It's literally government government service.
It's not a corporation really.
Xiaomi is super impressive. Xiaomi is 15 years old. It's the youngest company on this list. Next, I mean actually OpenAI
is OpenAI at 10 10 years old. The average age of these companies is 83
years old. But Xiai
and Open AAI 10 and 15 years old.
Well, you know, they made themselves into Monopoly in many ways. Uber just 16 years old.
You know, Rathon, that's that's kind of a monopoly. Rathon, Boing, guys like that.
Disney in a lot of ways is monopolistic.
Yeah, Xiaomi very impressive company. But it's also kind of what happens when the CCP is helping you out
here. Super young. Yeah.
BYD pretty young company itself.
But, you know, most of the really valuable companies, they're they're pretty much brand new.
Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's always new upstarts that want to come in and hand the old company,
you know, a nice dose of competition.
Yeah, Epic is a good one. Private company obviously, but yeah,
S&P Global 160 years old. I think you could probably put them in that category a bit, but you know, they compete very
very tough competition.
Yeah, there's some old companies uh like the older I mean Bear Bear Buyer is one
of the oldest companies in the world and it's it's not too high on the list. So age just age doesn't always help you.
This is a crazy one. Contemporary empirics 14 years old. That's called cattle sometimes.
the battery company
and then Pindu Duo I think one of the youngest here just 10 years old Pindu duo worth 140 billion.
Yeah, the Monsanto deal really [ __ ] things up for them, huh?
Average great company was founded in 1948.
This is the top uh top almost 100 companies.
I'm just short quantum is most of my portfolio. Then I like spruce cassava. I mean wait not cassava.
SPA app
Capricorn short.
Yeah, it's Lena Constrat right there.
I don't know, Randy. Worse from what perspective? Technology-wise, I'd probably agree.
Dwave is pretty bad, man. I'd almost rather take Qubt starting from scratch than what D-Wave has.
DW probably buy a gate based computing company. That might be a one way their stock can rally.
clipped. Yeah, BVAX might be starting to get up
there, right?
I'm not sure on Summit, man. Summit's a really hard one.
It's probably priced appropriately. I'll leave it at that.
Yeah, D-Wave's commercialization's not going so good.
I wouldn't say it's really early stage. Um,
it's actually quite late stage. It's just not well known and might take some time for people to realize the value. I
mean, can't force the stock market to do your your bidding. I mean, you got to be
patient. But some of you, you're not going to make it. For real? For real.
That's okay. More money for me. I can be patient. I'm not going
anywhere. And with my new kid, Torque, I'm really
not going anywhere. Oh yeah. Where's the public Zoom call?
Is that today? Advantage two.
Did we miss it?
Did you listen? Yeah. My kid's name Torque. So what
You mean you're not a fan of the Neo Brandisian school of antitrust?
Listen, there's no sector that's good to invest in. That doesn't that never makes
sense to me and it shouldn't make sense to you. Thematic investing is for idiots.

Fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Suasani Chandraali,
director of investor relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first
today is Apple's CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Kevin Perk. After
that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information
you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without
limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other
income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially
from our forecast, including risks related to the potential impact to the company's business and results of
operations from macroeconomic conditions, tariffs, and other measures and legal and regulatory proceedings.
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on form 10Q
and form 10K and the form 8K filed with the SEC today along with the associated
press release. Additional information will also be in our report on form 10K for the year
ended September 27th, 2025 to be filed tomorrow and in other reports and
filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made.
Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation
of these measures in our fourth quarter earnings release which is available on our investor relations website. I'd now
like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you Suasan. Good afternoon
everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today Apple is proud to report $
102.5 billion in revenue up 8% from a year ago and a September quarter record.
services achieved an all-time revenue record of 28.8 billion, growing 15% from
a year ago. EPS came in at a $185, setting a September quarter record. We
grew in the vast majority of markets we track and had September quarter revenue records in dozens of markets, including
the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, Korea,
and South Asia. We also set a September quarter revenue record in emerging markets and an all-time revenue record
in India. These results come at the close of an extraordinary year for Apple
in which we achieved an all-time revenue record of $416 billion for the fiscal
year. We set all-time revenue records in emerging and developed markets. We set
an all-time revenue record for iPhone and in services. We achieved all-time
records across every geographic segment. These results reflect the tremendous
customer enthusiasm for Apple products and services as well as our deep commitment to innovation.
We are incredibly excited about the strength we're seeing across our products and services and we expect the
December quarter's revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for iPhone.
We are heading into the holiday season with a truly remarkable lineup. That includes the biggest leap ever for
iPhone, which has had a tremendous response from our users around the world. Our Apple Watch lineup is more
capable than ever, too. giving users ways to take charge of their health like never before through new features like
hypertension notifications and sleep score. And the next level sound quality
and active noise cancellation of AirPods Pro 3 are hitting all the right notes for our users.
In October, we also broke new ground in power efficient performance with the
uncomparably fast M5 chip packed with neural accelerators in each GPU core to
supercharge AI workflows. iPad Pro combines gamechanging features
in iPad OS 26 with the power of M5 to create our most capable iPad ever. At
the same time, the M5 MacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with a
laptop, while the new M5 powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing
possibilities on its infinite canvas. We also launched a beautiful new software
design that creates a unified experience across all of our platforms for the very
first time. The design is crafted with a new material called liquid glass that
brings fluidity, vitality, and flexibility to our products.
Along with a new design, we delivered powerful new features to enable users to do even more with their devices. That
includes updates to the phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to help users
stay connected, continuity enhancements in Mac to deliver an even more seamless
experience across devices, and a powerful new windowing system that
fundamentally transforms the user experience in iPad OS 26. As we continue
to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products
and services, making every experience even more personal, capable, and
effortless. At the heart of it all is Apple Silicon, and we were thrilled to
launch new products powered by the A19 Prochip and M5.
These incredibly advanced chips make Apple products the very best place to
experience the power of AI. With Apple Intelligence, we've introduced dozens of new features that
are powerful, intuitive, private, and deeply integrated into the things people
do every day. Features like live translation. Top news alert. Apple CEO forecast
holiday quarter iPhone sales that top Wall Street estimates.

This is annoying.
Turning to iPad revenue was
$7 billion for the September quarter. Last month, we released one of the most
attentiongrabbing.
What the hell is wrong with this life-threatening condition? We're also excited about to improve it.
That's something I'm sure we can all benefit from. Meanwhile, AirPods Pro 3 have been a
huge hit. You have to hear them to really understand just how remarkable they are. Users and reviewers alike are
praising their incredible sound quality and improved fit. They feature the
world's best in-ear active noise cancellation, removing up to two times as much noise as the previous
generation. And with live translation powered by Apple intelligence, AirPods deliver an
incredibly new and exciting experience for users around the world. Turning to
services, as I mentioned earlier, revenue was 28.8 billion for the
September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year, and an all-time record.
We saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets, and set new all-time records across advertising,
app store, cloud services, music, payment services, and video.
Apple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins. The
studio led the night with 13 wins, the most of any comedy series in Emy's
history. Severance topped all dramas with eight wins, adding to the accolades for this
landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now earned over 600 wins and 2,800
nominations in total, driven by powerful original storytelling.
And we're excited for audiences to discover new productions like Pluribus and to catch returning favorites like
Slow Horses and The Morning Show. And soon, Apple TV will be the
destination for F1 fans across the US on track day, thanks to a new partnership
with Formula 1. F1 is one of the most exciting and
fastest growing sports in the world. And starting next year, Apple TV will be the
place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season.
And in addition, F1 the movie, one of the year's biggest blockbusters, will be
coming to Apple TV on December 12th. During the September quarter, we also
marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple News. Apple News provides access to front page news from all around the
world, putting hundreds of publications right at users fingertips.
Turning to retail, we're heading into our busiest time of year with our best ever lineup.
In the last few months, we've opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the US
and China. I was also in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and
re-imagined Apple Ginsa store, and the energy among the crowd was truly
remarkable. When it originally opened, it was our first store outside the United States,
and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome customers to the beautiful new space.
Everywhere we operate and in everything we do, we strive to give the best to our
users while living by our values. Whether that's building new accessibility features into our most
recent software releases or advancing our environmental work by using even
more recycled materials in our latest lineup or providing free educational
programming to train and support American businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. And
we're continuing to invest in innovation and user experiences that will transform our future. A great example is the work
we're doing in the US where we're committed to invest $600 billion over
the next four years with a focus on innovation in strategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon
engineering, and artificial intelligence. These commitments build on our
long-standing investments in America while supporting more than 450,000 jobs
with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new factory in Houston for
advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping its first products off the line, and we're leading the
creation of end toend silicon supply chain across the country. In recent months, I've connected with
developers, innovators, artists, entrepreneurs, and so many others around
the world. People passionate about innovation and all the things they can do with Apple products. Each one is
another reminder of why we do what we do. We're driven to empower people to do
more of the things that matter most to them and enrich their lives along the way.
As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn't be more excited for what's to
come. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin. Thanks, Tim. And good afternoon,
everyone. Our revenue of $102.5 billion was up 8% year-over-year and is a new
September quarter record. We set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of
Asia Pacific, and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products
revenue was $73.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across
iPhone and Mac, and reached a September quarter record. Thanks to our exceptional customer satisfaction and
strong levels of loyalty, our install base of active devices has reached another all-time high across all product
categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was 28.8 billion, up
15% year-over-year and an all-time record. The performance was broad-based
with double-digit growth in the vast majority of the markets we track and doubledigit growth across most of our
services categories. Company gross margin was 47.2%
above the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix.
This includes approximately 1.1 billion of tariff related costs which is in line with what we had estimated on our last
call. Products gross margin was 36.2% up 170 basis points sequentially driven
by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 75.3%
down 30 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at 15.9
billion up 11% year-over-year driven by increased investment in R&D.
These strong levels of business performance led to September quarter records for both net income and diluted
earnings per share. Net income was $27.5 billion and diluted earnings per share
was $185, up 13% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, excluding the one-time
charge we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was also a September
quarter record at $ 29.7 billion. Now, I'm going to provide some more
details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6%
year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority
of the markets we track with September quarter records in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the
Middle East, and South Asia, and an all-time record in India. The iPhone
active install base grew to an all-time high, and we set a September quarter record for upgraders.
According to the recent survey from World Panel, iPhone was a top-selling model in the US, urban China, the UK,
France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see very high levels of
customer satisfaction in the US at 98% as measured by 451 research.
Mac revenue was $ 8.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by MacBook Air.
We grew in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. The Mac install base reached
another all-time high with nearly half of customers who purchased a Mac being new to the product. And the latest
customer satisfaction for Mac in the US was reported at 96%.
iPad revenue was $7 billion, flat year-over-year. Keep in mind, we faced a
difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air and iPad Pro launch from last year, offset by the
better thanex expected performance on the iPad. The install base reached an all-time high with a September quarter
record for upgraders and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the
product. Based on the latest reports from 451 research, customer satisfaction was 98%
in the US. wearables home and accessories revenue was $9 billion flat year-over-year. This
was driven by growth on watch and AirPods offset by accessories which was impacted by strong performance in the
year ago quarter driven by the iPad launches. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods
installed bases reached new all-time highs. Over half of the customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the
quarter were new to the product and we also set a September record for upgraders on Apple Watch.
And in the US, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95%.
Our services revenue reached an all-time high of 28.8 billion, up 15%
year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe,
Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific, as well as a September quarter record in greater China.
The majority of categories saw a sequential acceleration. And as Tim mentioned, we set many all-time revenue
records, including payment services, where we reached an all-time revenue record and saw a double-digit growth
year-over-year on Apple Pay active users. This strong momentum in the September
quarter drove our total fiscal year services revenue to surpass $100 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and our
best ever. The growth of our install base of active devices continues to offer us great
opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting
and paid accounts reached new all-time highs. And we continue to improve the quality and expand the reach of our
services offerings. From additional markets for Apple Pay, now available in nearly 90 countries to Apple Care 1, a
great new way to cover multiple Apple products in a single plan. Turning to enterprise, we are seeing an adoption of
Apple products accelerate across industries to improve productivity and drive innovation. The BMW group has been
deploying tens of thousands of iPhones, including to factory employees to further strengthen its digital
capabilities and advanced innovation at the company. Capital 1 has expanded its
Mac choice program by adding thousands more MacBook airs across its workforce. In the Czech Republic, its largest bank,
Chesca Sportellna, continues to invest in the Apple ecosystem with over 5,000
iPhones in addition to its existing thousands of iPads and Macs. And Purdue
University has launched a spatial computing hub built around Vision Pro, designed to help prepare students to
lead the next wave of innovation in critical industries like semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing.
Let's turn to our cash position in capital return program. We ended the quarter with $132 billion
in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3 billion of debt maturities and
decreased commercial paper by $ 1.9 billion resulting in $9 billion in total
debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $34 billion.
During the quarter, we returned $ 24 billion to shareholders. This included
3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and 20 billion through open market repurchases of 89 million Apple shares.
Taking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025 results. As Tim mentioned, total company
revenue for the year was 416 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and
services and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue performance led to very strong
fullear operating results with all-time records for net income and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits
year-over-year on an adjusted basis. As we move ahead into the December
quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasi referred to. Importantly, the color
we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies, and application
remain in effect as of this call, and the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today.
We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow by 10 to 12% year-over-year,
which would be our best quarter ever. We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would be
our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind, we expect to face a very
difficult compare against the M4, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac launches in the year ago quarter. We expect
services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025.
We expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48% which includes an estimated
impact of 1.4 billion of tariff related costs. And as we've said before, we are
significantly increasing our investments in AI while continuing to invest in our product roadmap. And so for the December
quarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5
billion. We expect Oene to be around $150 million, excluding any potential impact
from the marktomarket of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%.
Finally, today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 26 cents per share of common stock payable on
November 13th, 2025 to shareholders of record as of November 10th, 2025.
With that, let's open the call to questions. Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit
yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for uh taking my question and congrats on the results. Um Tim, c can you maybe
share a bit more detail on uh why you think the the iPhone 17 is is having the
degree of success that it is at this point? And and really the question is, do you believe this is, you know, the
aged install base uh replacement cycle kicking in or are there specific
features or functionality you believe stand out this cycle versus past cycles that consumers are really looking for?
And then just a quick follow-up. Thanks, Eric. Thanks for your comments. Uh I
think it's all about the product. Uh the pro the product lineup is incredibly
strong. They're strongest ever. The 17 Pro is the most pro phone we've ever
done. It's it's incredible and the design uh sings. The iPhone Air is uh feels so
thin and so light in your hand, it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is um is in an incredible
value and takes several of the features that were reserved for Pro before and
brings them down to the consumer lineup. So overall, strongest iPhone lineup ever
and it's resonating around the world.
Great. Thank you. Uh thank you Tim. And then and maybe a followup um for you Kevin. C can you maybe just discuss your
approach to to managing component cost inflation during this time? Uh you're you're obviously increasing the memory
content in your devices quite substantially. At the same time, memory prices are going through some pretty
significant inflation. So just how are you managing uh through this cycle? Thanks so much guys.
Yeah, hey Eric, thanks for the question. Look, as you know um we've got a pretty incredible world-class procurement team
and sort of constantly finding ways to um continue to drive cost opportunities. right now on the commodity side, you
know, I would say we're we're seeing, you know, a slight tailwind on memory in storage prices. So, nothing really to
note there. Um, and as we saw from our gross margin performance, we landed in a pretty good spot above the high end of
the guidance range we provided at 47.2%. And then as well, we're guiding at 47 to
48%. So, I think we're managing cost pretty well. As you'll recall, you know, when we talked about this this time in
the cycle, we just launched a bunch of new products. Those new products do have a slightly higher cost structure than the products they replace, but the team
does a very good job of focusing our efforts on getting those costs down over time. And we feel pretty good about the
performance we're seeing right now overall on material cost savings. Great. Thanks so much. Good luck, guys.
All right. Thank you. Thanks, Eric. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Our next question is from Ben Ritz with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Hey guys, thanks for this. Uh Tim, uh can you talk a little bit about iPhone
in China specifically? Uh how is that going to trend in the December quarter?
And have you turned the corner there? And and and how do you think that trajectory is going? And then I have a quick followup. Thanks.
Yeah, Ben, I was just there. It's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The
store traffic is up significantly year-over-year. Uh the iPhone uh 17 has been the family
has been very well received uh there and we do believe that uh we'll
return to growth in Q1 and that is largely based on the reception of the
iPhone there and so I couldn't be more pleased with uh with how things are
going there in the early going. Well, that's great. And then services.
Um, great upside there. Little surprising, right? Um, we were a little worried about that one only a few
quarters ago. Um, I was wondering I if uh there were any tax payments in there
or, you know, if the resolution that we saw with the the antitrust ruling uh
with one of your partners um was a boost and and if that played a role or if it was all really just um organic
outperformance with many of the things you mentioned. Thanks. Yeah. Hey Ben, it's Kevin here. Let me try to answer
that question. You're referring Just wanted to clarify when you're referring to the antitrust piece. You're talking about um the Google trial. Is that what
you're referring to? Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah. There was no tax related impact. And what I would say is our
strong performance for the quarter is really organically driven. And again, just to reiterate, we had a um you know,
all-time revenue record year for the quarter at 28.8 billion. And as well, we
surpassed 100 billion. So, best, you know, best year ever at 14% year-on-year. So, really that was all organic growth. Um, as Tim outlined and
I outlined in the prepared remarks, you know, we saw um a majority of the categories have sequential acceleration
and we had many all-time revenue records, but you know, nothing abnormal at all. Really, really pretty much all organic growth.
Thank you. Thanks, Ben. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Our next question is from Michael Ing. Please go ahead.
Uh hi, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Uh I just have two as well. Um first, just to follow up on the last
one, um you know, the the services revenue growth I think was the the fastest across um uh many categories and
and certainly the fastest in in the last two years. Um I just wondering if you could just um unpack a little bit more
the drivers of the acceleration. um you know, was there kind of cross-selling with the new iPhone launch? Was it just
um installed base growth? I know you've been doing a lot of bundling with Apple 1 and and Apple Care 1. Uh so any
thoughts on on that would be very helpful. And then I just have a quick followup. Thank you. Hi Michael, it's Kevin. Thanks for the
question. Yeah, let me build on on the answer there. I think that the way we looked at it is not one thing to point to that would have driven, you know, um
this higher performance. You're right that it is slightly higher than we've seen the last few quarters. But as you know, our services portfolio is very
broad um with a broad range of businesses all that have different growth profiles and different performance characteristics. So those
can you know vary in any given quarter. Um I would say our strength again was very broad-based um both across
categories and also geographically. So I wouldn't point to any particular um you know factor that drove any kind of
outperformance at all. We were just very pleased to see you know see that result.
Great. Thank you. Um and just on iPhone sell through um I was wondering if you
were seeing any um notable shifts in in trends between uh the sell through
coming from uh upgraders versus switchers. Um is the you know US carrier
um competitive dynamic helping at all in terms of promotional activity? Um and
any thoughts on on channel inventory? Thank you. Okay. Uh we did set a September quarter
record for upgraders and so it was a it was a great quarter from that point of
view. It's really too early in the cycle on on 17 to make any comments about
upgraders or or switchers. In terms of channel inventory, uh we ended the
quarter toward the low end of the targeted range. uh obviously because we had constraints on the on se several
models of the 16 and the and the 17 and for for complete transparency and
clarity we're constrained today on several models of the iPhone 17. There's
not a ramp issue. Uh it's just we have very strong demand and and and we're
working uh very hard to uh fulfill uh all the orders that we have.
Great. Thank you Tim. Thank you Kevin. All right. Thanks Mike. Operator, could we get the
next question please? Our next question is from Amit Dariani
with Evercore. Please go ahead. Yep. Uh thanks a lot too as well. Uh I I
guess Kevin maybe just start with gross margins. Can you just walk through the expectations for December quarter? I
think it implies up 30 basis points so sequentially. Um can you just talk about the puts and takes on gross margin given
you do have very sizable operating leverage in the quarter. So just maybe what are the puts and takes around that would be really helpful.
Yeah sure. Um I let me walk through the outlook as as I as we mentioned in our outlook we targeting a range of 47 to
48%. If you take the midpoint of that range at the 47, you know, and a half, you said it's roughly 25 basis points,
30 basis points higher. Um, really there's there's a lot of puts and takes as I talked about earlier. Um, this is a
quarter we launched a lot of new products. Those new products tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace. So there's
definitely a impact from the cost um side of things, but that was more than offset by favorable mix, especially on
the product side. As well as you outlined, we typically see higher leverage in this quarter. So I would say those are the two big drivers. And so
sequential increase is really going to be driven by favorable mix and particularly from the product side.
Got it. And then you know if I just go back to the China discussion for a minute uh you know the performance in
China at least in September quarter was a bit muted. Uh could you just talk about what resulted in the weakness over
there and do you think it was a bit more of a pause given you know iPhone air for example I don't think was available till
until a few weeks ago. just talk about what drove the weakness in September and you know is the uptick or better
expectations for December there just from the iPhone air coming out or are there other factors as well? Thank you.
Yeah, uh the greater China revenue was down 4% in the year-over-year in the
September quarter. It was driven by iPhone and if you look at the iPhone,
the majority of the sequential year-over-year change was due to supply constraints that I mentioned earlier.
And so it was basically supply constraints that that drove the results.
We're thrilled with what we're seeing right now with with traffic being up significantly year-over-year and the
reception of the 17 family. Uh we expect to return to growth this quarter.
Top news alert. Trump sets refugee ceiling at record low 7,500 with focus on white South Africa. operator. Could
we have the next question, please? Our next question is from Wamy Mowen
with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Uh yes, thank you so much. Uh Tim, if I
could follow up on your comments about uh the constraint supply in the quarter uh just given the very strong demand for
for iPhones. Uh do you expect that as you can see your visibility across
demand and and supply? Do you think that you will be exiting December at a point where you wouldn't be constrained
anymore or do you still expect that there could be constraints as you exit the December quarter and then any any
way to quantify sort of what revenue could have been um in in this quarter
without constraints? Yeah. Uh the if you look at the supply
constraints uh today we're we are constrained on several 17 models. uh
we're not predicting uh when the supply demand will balance. Uh we're obviously
working very hard to achieve that uh because we want to get as many of these
products out to to the customers as possible, but but today I'm not going to
to predict. Okay. Okay. Thanks, D. Yeah. And then as
a followup, um, you know, I heard you talk about new records across a lot of
categories and and services. I didn't hear search explicitly called out. So
maybe it's a little bit of a followup to Ben's question, but given that there are some concerns around search volumes
decelerating at the expense of AI, how do you think about the broader sustainability of these very strong mid-
teens growth rates for for services or or you know extended period of time not just not just for next quarter where
you're obviously guiding to 14. Uh this is Tim. The advertising category
which is a combination of third party and uh first party uh did set a record
during the quarter.
Okay. And sorry just to be clear both both Apple's own internal advertising
and within the licensing but individually set records. I actually I'm not saying that. I'm just
saying that the combination of the two set a record. We don't divi I'm dodging the question intentionally because we
don't split it at that level. Okay. Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Wy operator. Could we get the next question please?
Our next question is from Samic Chattery with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Hi. U thanks for taking my question. Uh maybe for the first one Tim you talked about the strong momentum you're seeing
in China which is also driving your conference for the December quarter. Any thoughts on the role um that the
smartphone subsidies in that region are playing in this momentum and how do you think about sort of what portion of
consumers are maybe using some of those subsidies leveraging the subsidies at this point? Uh any more insights into
that? Uh and I have a followup. Thank you. Yeah the subsidies uh play a favorable
role. Uh the subsidies as you know are uh sort of across multiple categories uh
from PCs to tablets to smartwatches and and smartphones.
And however, it's important to note they only apply to certain price ranges. And
so there's a maximum price and there's several of our products that are that
sell above that price and therefore are not eligible for a subsidy.
And uh but but it but it does have a favorable effect and uh it's it's
clearly in uh at least from our vantage point driving some consumer demand.
Okay. Okay. Got it. And a follow up for Kevin here. Um on the OPEX increase going into the December quarter, fairly
sizable step up. So if you could just dig into that number a bit more, what's what are sort of the components uh
towards what you're spending and then that increase year-over-year in OPEX
does sort of exceed your revenue growth. So is that sort of what we should expect on a going forward basis as well where
you probably need to invest a bit more in the near future? Thank you. Yeah, Samic. Thank thanks for that question. Um, you know, as we've been
outlining and reiterated in our last call, you know, we are increasing our investments in AI while also continuing
to invest in our product roadmap. So, the vast majority of the increase to our operating expenses are driven by R&D.
You know, while we continue to manage the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way, we're also managing the business for the long term and are super
excited about all the opportunities we see ahead. As it relates to the question around OPEX and revenue growth, while OPEX has
been growing at a faster rate than revenue, you know, we have seen gross margin expansion. And so when we look at
that on in a combined basis, it does allow us to have healthy operating leverage and our operating income growth has been generally outpacing revenue
growth for the past, you know, several years.
Thank you. Thanks a lot. Awesome. Thank you. Sick. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Our next question is from David Vote with UBS. Please go ahead.
Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions. So maybe Kevin, can I ask first, can you help us understand sort
of the tariff impact sequentially from the September quarter to the December quarter particularly around iPhone
supply constraints because I think I heard you say tariffs go from 1.1 to 1.4 4 billion, but the sequential uplift in
iPhone revenue and presumably production given supply chain constraints is, you know, dramatically bigger. So, you can
help us understand how to think about the timing of those tariff headwinds as we move forward and sort of that correlation. And then I have a followup.
Uh David, I'll take this one. Uh you're right. It goes from 1 to a projection of
14. And the 14 is based on sort of what we know right now and where the tariff
rates and policies and and so forth are. So it assumes a
um stable kind of environment for the quarter. It does comprehend the change
that was just made which we're very encouraged to see. uh with the um
the tariffs uh moving from 20% to 10% in China and so that is factored in and
that is one of the reasons why the uh it's it's not linear to volume if you
will that make sense got it no that's helpful that's asking if the change is reflected in that
outlook and then just as a followup you know when when you think about I think on the max I I know people aren't asking
about it. You talked about the tough comp, but you're going into sort of a holiday season. I I understand that. But
when you think about the attached possibility for other products to the iPhone in the holiday season, you know,
how do we think about sort of where the consumer's head's at and their wallet is at this point in the cycle? And granted,
it is a tough comp, but is there an opportunity to see some maybe upside from an attach rate perspective given the strength of the iPhone portfolio?
Uh we always like to remind people that buy an iPhone uh all the other things
that we offer and and so you can bet that we're doing that. From a from a Mac
point of view, the challenge is that last year was sort of the mother of all Mac launches.
Uh all of these uh from Mac Mini to iMac to all the MacBook Pros all launched uh
literally at the same time. And this year that compares to launching
the 14in MacBook Pro. And so there's a very difficult compare. Uh, of of course
in the long run I'm very bullish on the MAC and you can see that the MAC uh
again last quarter outgrew the the market and and so we feel really well
about how MAC is positioned, but this certain quarter uh is a extremely difficult compare.
Yeah, Tim, I'll add to that that we also have the DRAM upgrades last year for the Mac lineup. Good point. also is another factor.
Great. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, sure. Thank you, David. Operator, could we get
the next question, please? Our next question is from Chris Sanker
with TD Cowan. Please go ahead. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the iPhone constraints.
Is there a way to quantify how much business you left on the table because of those constraints? And is the
different iPhone manufacturing from two different regions contributing to the constraint? And then I have a follow-up
for you. Uh to be clear, the uh constraint uh was
not related to uh manufacturing capacity per se. it was
that we called the number of iPhone 16s that we were going to make and uh were a
bit short of where the demand really was. So, we could have sold more. We're we're not uh publicly at least
estimating uh the extent of that. And then on iPhone 17 family, it's the demand is is
very strong. And so we obviously came out of the Q4
uh time frame with lots of back orders.
Got it. Thanks for that Tim. And then a quick followup uh you know given like the prevalence of chat bots and now some
of these AI infused web services. Do you think that could change the consumer behavior on mobile app ecosystems?
Uh or are you seeing any of that and would that have any impact on your app store?
uh I think there are uh opportunities on the app store with artificial
intelligence uh and so I I think you know as we have made our ondevice models available for
developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them and so I I think as
you as that uh proliferates uh there's an opportunity to uh for
developers and for Apple to to benefit from that from adding features to their
apps and so forth. Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.
Thank you. Thanks, Chris. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have two as well. I I guess the first question is when we look at the iPhone
17 demand, which you've, you know, repeatedly highlighted is very strong. I I'm curious if there's been any
discernable kind of change in the mix within the iPhone 17 categories between the Pro uh and the Pro Max versions
relative to prior cycles. It's really uh too early to call the mix
to be honest and we don't like to publicly disclose that because of the the competit for competitive reasons but
frankly we don't really know what the mix will be yet because we have constraints on both sides of the the
ledger at the top and at the entry and so we'll see what happens in as we get
more supply. Yeah. And then as a quick followup, I'm
curious as we kind of work through kind of the AI narrative that continues to build. Is there could you provide any
kind of updated thoughts around the the buildout of Apple's private compute cloud and how we should think about that
kind of a as we look forward? Yeah, we're obviously using uh PC PCC,
our private cloud compute uh today for a number of queries uh for Siri and uh we
will continue to build it out. In fact, the the manufacturing plant that makes
the the servers used for Apple Intelligence uh just started uh
manufacturing in Houston uh a few weeks ago. And we've got a you know a ramp
plan there uh for use in our data centers. Uh and you know it's uh it's
robust. Yeah. And Erin I'll add maybe there too since you asked the question about private cloud compute that we um in 25
we did have capex costs associated with building out our private cloud comput environment in our first party data
centers. So you know you would have seen that in some of the um capex investment in the year.
Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Aaron. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Our next question is from Office Malik with City. Please go ahead.
Hi, thank you for taking my questions and great execution. The first question is on iPhone Air. Does the consumer
reception on iPhone air, you know, gives you a feel on perhaps the foldable cone market or are the two form factors very
different? uh I'm not sure that they're uh that one
is a proxy for the other. Uh the thing that I would say is that where we don't get into the model kind of demand at the
aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been received and that's the reason that we're expecting
double-digit growth in the current quarter. Great. And Tim, as a followup, uh, good
to know that the personalized Siri is making good progress um, and on track for next year. Will you continue to use
a three-prong approach with your own foundation models and partner with other LLM providers and maybe potential M&A or
is one strategy more emphasized over another? Uh, we're obviously uh, creating uh,
Apple foundation models uh, within Apple. uh we we ship them on device and
use them in the the private cloud compute as well. And we've got several
uh in development. And so uh we also from a
uh continually to surveil the market on M&A and are open to
uh pursuing M&A if it if we think that it will advance our roadmap.
Okay, sounds like a deal is coming. Thank you. Thanks, AIF. Operator, can we get our
last question, please? Our last question is from Richard Kramer
with a rate research. Please go ahead. Who the hell? Thank you very much, Tim. We've often
seen Apple be a fast follower with iPhone and new technology, whether large displays or 4G or 5G. But with all the
hype now around AI, are you seeing evidence that AI capabilities or features are a material purchase
consideration for consumers? Uh, or the record sales levels you're you're
reporting simply reflecting other factors like the retention of your iOS base?
I think that uh there are many factors that influence people's purchasing
considerations and so and uh we don't have a
uh great uh in-depth survey yet on the current iPhone 17 because it's very new
in the cycle and we uh give it some time to to uh formulate. But I would say that
Apple intelligence is a factor. Uh, and you know, we're very bullish on
it becoming a greater factor. And so that's that's the way that we look at it.
Okay. Thanks. And then one for Kevin. In the wake of nearly every other large tech company massively increasing their
capex in advance of AI demand and also mentioning that there's scarce capacity,
do you anticipate Apple altering its sort of long-standing hybrid approach to your own and third party data centers
and maybe can you talk a little bit about the role you see for Apple silicon with the new M5 series of chipsets?
Yeah, hi Richard. Um, thanks for the question. In general, I think as we've talked about before, we are expecting
increases um in our capex spending related to AI investments. For example, as I mentioned earlier, um we did end up
having investments this year to build out our private cloud compute environment. And we do believe this hybrid model has served us very well and
we continue to want to leverage it. And so I don't see us moving away from this hybrid model where we leverage both
first party capacity as well as, you know, leverage thirdparty capacity. We'll continue to want to build out
private cloud compute. um as Tim outlined as we have more um usage there over time, but I think in general we
want to continue to have this hybrid model.
Okay, thanks. Thanks, Richard. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on
