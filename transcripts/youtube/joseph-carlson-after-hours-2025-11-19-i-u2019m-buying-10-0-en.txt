Welcome everyone. Today on the Joseph
Carlson show, I am buying $10 to $20,000
of this stock. The company's Mastercard.
Now, everyone knows about Mastercard,
but for most of you, your impression of
it would be that it is a credit card
company. That's about it. It's just one
of the big credit card companies.
Nothing really exciting going on about
this one. But you'd be wrong. Many
investors don't realize what's actually
going on behind the scenes with
Mastercard. Mastercard has evolved far
from a credit card company. In fact,
that is an outdated view of this
business. Mastercard could more
accurately be described now as a global
commerce operating system, a business
that is a cyber security firm, one that
has unparalleled level of data. It's a
company that the more that I researched
it, in fact, I did a lot of research
over the past couple of days, the more
that I realized that this is one of the
most misunderstood stocks in the market.
People's perceptions of Mastercard and
what it actually is are dramatically
different. So, we're going to dive into
it today. We're going to be looking at
the stock as well. We're going to be
looking at the price point of it, why
it's traded flat this year, despite the
fact that it's had incredibly fast
growth. Mastercard is growing very fast.
The economics are incredible. The moat
is insanely wide. But what's lesser
understood again is the pivot that's
happening with the business model.
Mastercard is changing its business over
time. It's changing its core value
proposition and even the revenue that
it's gaining is changing. We're going to
be going over it and I want to dive into
this one because it's already a large
position in my portfolio. It's a company
that I don't talk about too often
because frankly it's considered a boring
company. But when I looked at this one,
I became more and more excited about it.
It's something where I realize that this
is again one that people just don't
understand. So we'll be diving in it
learning about the new businesses that
Mastercard's going into and the reason
that I'm buying another 10 to $20,000 of
the stock. Now, as always, we have a lot
of other news to get to. For example,
Google finally peaked above $300 per
share. There's a lot of gain taking as
that happens when a stock goes up to all
new highs. It was up 5.5% and then it's
traded down to just up 3.5%. Google
continues to lead the Mac 7. It leads
the market. It's just crushing
everything right now. What is going on
with Google? Well, of course, they
released their new Gemini 3.0 model, and
it's good. It's really good. We're going
to be going over it. I'll be sharing
some thoughts of what this model does,
why investors are so excited about it,
and how Google fits in with the rest of
my portfolio. We'll be going over the
positioning of Google. Now, of course,
we have on the calendar today that
Nvidia is posting their earnings. We'll
be going over what are the main factors
investors are looking for. And then
finally, as I was looking for my new
fail of the week segment, I found this
clip, which was reportedly supposed to
be a fail of the week, but as I watched
it, I had the opposite reaction. I'll be
going over what I think is the win of
the week. We'll be looking at why I
think this Tik Tok video is actually
genuinely good advice. So, we have a ton

into the new buy. We're going to be
talking a lot about Mastercard, but
before we do that, I just want to take a
quick pit stop on the way and check in
with Google. It's another time that we
can just celebrate. And I know I know
we've had a lot of celebrations about
Google, but that's only because this
stock just goes up. That's what it's
been doing. And this is one that I'm
very happy about because I've said for a
long time, Google will go above $300 per
share. Early this morning, it did just
that. It peaked above $300 per share.
Lots of investors celebrated. Some of
them took gains. It's down to $294 per
share. It's going to go back up. This
will be above $300 per share. In terms
of the positioning, there's time periods
where I've been more bullish on Google
than others. Time periods where I've
been a little bit concerned about
Google. But overall, what I believe I
did the most right with this position is
when I finally came to the conclusion
that Google is fine. When I made that
conclusion far before Wall Street did,
about 6 months before Wall Street did, I
bet heavily on the stock. When I came to
that realization that Google is going to
be all right, I put more money in the
stock than I usually do. I followed
Charlie Munger's advice that when you
have an edge on a stock, when you
believe the odds are heavily in your
favor, that's when you should bet big.
If you don't bet big during those time
periods, well, you're just going to miss
out and you don't have that many time
periods where you know something the
market does in advance. So in this case,
this is one of the rare cases, the
opportunities that come once in a while,
where investors can figure something out
long before Wall Street does, months and
months ahead of time. If you do figure
that out and you're highly confident in
your decision, you believe that the
downside is extremely limited and the
upside is very material, that's a time
period to bet big, to put more money
into a holding than you usually do.
Looking at it combined today, Google is
a $175,000 position, $77,000 in the
green. That doesn't count dividends.
with dividends, it would be about
$82,000 in the green. Google has passed
up even my gains in Netflix. Now, why is
Google stock continuing to go up so
much? Well, of course, it's because the
Gemini 3.0 model was released. Like
Sundar Pachi said, he's mentioned it
many times. It wasn't a surprise. He
said he's going to release it by the end
of 2025. Uh he said it's really good.
Well, it is. And this is the reaction to
it.
>> Hey Morgan, that's right. It was the
Gemini 3.0 launch and Alphabet shares
are higher today. So, a bright spot amid
sort of this larger anxiety rattling the
AI trade. It's been volatile though
because the market's not just tracking
model quality or traffic anymore. It's
tracking capex, the rising role of debt,
circular financing. Plus, the Gemini 3.0
launch, excuse me. It has to compete
with comments from Senator Pai to the
BBC today where he says that the
trillion dollar AI boom has elements of
irrationality and he says, "No firm is
immune if the bubble bursts." Now that's
a quote that's taken out of context.
It's true that Sundar Pachai said that
there's elements of irrationality to
this market like there always is but he
mentions I think three times maybe at
least twice that the the momentum right
now the excitement around AI is
rational. That's what Sundar Pachai
says. He says it's entirely rational.
People should be excited about AI.
>> Alphabet has however and this is what
Morgan alluded to outperformed the other
big AI players over the past 3 months.
It's at least climbed, if not
obliterated, the wall of worry.
Investors, they're finally appreciating
this deep integration that Google has
from its chips, its TPUs to models,
cloud ecosystem, which also underpins
this Gemini launch. Now, this is another
benchmark topping model and it ships.
>> Google has obliterated the wall of
worry. Now, everybody's looking at it
and it's like the greatest AI company.
It has all this stuff working out, the
whole full stack.
>> It's Gemini at the scale of Google.
That's how center pai put it. meaning
that it'll be integrated into AI mode
and that's the default experience for
most Google users, not just the ones
that are seeking out AI chatbots.
Meanwhile, the Gemini app for those that
are seeking a chatbot. It does continue
to close that gap between itself and
OpenAI's chat GBT. Pai says the app now
has 650 million monthly active users.
OpenAI said in August that chat GBT hits
700 million weekly users. And then
you've got thirdparty data from similar
web backing up that trend if it's not
exactly apples to apples. Um so
>> Google continues to win. They're winning
across the board. So as of now I
continue to hold all my shares. I'm glad
to have it as my top position. I'm
reluctant to do what a lot of super
investors are doing trimming their
Google. I think that's a mistake. I
think it's a bit too early. I do believe
that the valuation to quality gap is
closing for Google, but I think it will
be mostly closed at around 350. I think
there's still a ways to go. Now, moving
on, we get into another company that I
don't talk about quite as often. We have
the story fund here. This company isn't
in the story fund. If we switch over to
the passive income portfolio, we can see
where this holding lives. It is
Mastercard. Mastercard is in the finance
category. Now, the position size is
$100,000 and it's $29,000 in the green.
And like I've mentioned before,
Mastercard historically, at least the
way that I believe most investors view
the company, is a credit card company.
And if you don't view it as a credit
card company, you probably just view it
as a payment transaction company, a data
company, one that facilitates payments
across the globe, competing with Visa.
And that's a correct view for about half
the company, for about 50% of it. And in
fact, a declining portion of the company
over time, that's going to be a minority
part of Mastercard. What you're missing
with Mastercard, and what I believe most
investors are missing, is this other
massive, incredible business that's
growing much faster that they've built
while doing so very quietly. In fact,
Mastercard doesn't really talk that much
about this business. They just grow it
behind the scenes year after year after
year. But Mastercard has been making an
aggressive pivot from their main value
proposition of being just a credit card
company to being a high-end data and
security company. When we look at
Mastercard here on Qualram, we can see
the overall revenue. This is just the
quarterly statements over time, every
quarterly revenue, and it's growing
rather fast. You can see the growth is
16.7% revenue growth over the past
year-over-year. Now, if we compare that
to Visa, Visa is not growing quite as
fast. If you look at Visa's revenue, you
can see that it's grown at 12%. So, Visa
is at 12%, Mastercard's at uh 16%. Why
is Mastercard growing so fast? If we
look at just the payment metric, this is
actually growing around the same speed
as Visa. So they're both growing around
the same. The payment network of
Mastercard and the payment network of
Visa growing around the same speed. But
where is that 17% growth coming from?
And that's this other segment here
called value added services. Value added
services grew at 24.93%
year-over-year. So basically 25%. when
you average it out, that's the reason
that Mastercard is growing so fast. So,
what is this value added services? That
seems very vague. We don't really know
what that means, and that's where we
dive into a little bit of research. The
value added services is extremely
meaningful. In fact, calling Mastercard
a credit card company is becoming
outdated. They are rapidly morphing into
a data and security firm that happens to
process payments. In 2025, these value
added services, VAS, are no longer just
a side hustle. They're the company's
main growth engine. The hard numbers, it
is massive. That segment represents 37
to 38% of Mastercard's total revenue. It
generates approximately 11 billion
annually. To put that in perspective,
Mastercard's service business alone is
larger than the entire revenue of many
S&P 500 companies. The growth rate, this
segment is consistently growing at 20 to
25%. Significantly faster than the core
transaction business, which grows
roughly 10 to 12%. This service business
from Mastercard that nobody ever talks
about is growing as fast as like cloud
companies. It's growing faster than
Microsoft. It's growing faster than
Google. It's growing faster than Amazon.
It's growing as fast as Meta, but it has
higher margins. Yet, this line of
business again is just never mentioned
on the news or anywhere else. And I find
that very interesting. So, what exactly
is this stuff? Mastercard effectively
sells peace of mind and intelligence to
the same banks and merchants that use
its payment rails. The three main
pillars of these services are first
cyber security and fraud. The biggest
driver, this is the lock-in mechanism.
They use AI to monitor billions of
transactions in real time to stop fraud
before it happens. They also sell
identity verification, verifying who you
are and you know what you say you are
and device intelligence. They have
acquired key acquisitions like the
recorded future, a threat intelligence
company for 2.65 65 billion that allows
them to sell detailed cyber security and
intel to government and banks and they
have a lot of business with a lot of
governments moving completely outside of
the payments category. Why it sells? If
you are a bank, you could build your own
fraud detection or you could just pay
Mastercard to use the data from three
billion cards that they already monitor.
It's an easy sell. So the reason that
they don't have some massive marketing
budget is that they have a product so
incredibly distinguishly good that it
literally sells itself. They just have
to go out and contact banks, tell them
what they offer, they will sign up for
it. Then you have part two, the data and
analytics and consulting. Mastercard
sits on one of the world's most valuable
data sets, real-time global spending
habits. What they do, they strip the
personal info and sell the trends to
retailers, governments, and banks. And
this is where we get into one of the
most incredible examples of this product
that Mastercard has. You can take the
example of a retail chain like Starbucks
or Target. They might hire Mastercard to
answer the question, where could we open
our next 10 stores based on where
high-spending coffee drinkers actually
live and walk? If these companies are
actually like trying to determine where
they're going to get the best ROI from
their locations, they ask Mastercard
that Mastercard can definitively answer
that question in a way that no one else
can. They have a massive internal
consulting arm, Mastercard Advisors that
functions like McKenzie for payments,
helping banks optimize their portfolios,
helping retailers and different
restaurants know where to open. any of
these type of large companies are going
to be going to Mastercard to answer
these hard questions. Then they have
loyalty and rewards. Mastercard manages
the backend for airline miles, hotel
points, and credit card cashback
programs. The hook is that when
Mastercard runs the bank's entire reward
portal that cannot be easily switched to
Visa without disrupting their customers
points. This creates incredibly high
switching costs. These are very unique
and compelling products from a very fast
growing business. 20 to 25% revenue
growth again in the top tier premium
category. And you may be saying, well,
what is so unique about it? After all,
there's Visa. Don't they offer services
as well? They do, but they're actually
more different than you might think.
They do compete on value added services,
but with different philosophies.
Mastercard has leaned heavily in to
technology and especially cyber
security. Visa has leaned far more into
payments, direct payments. Mastercard is
aggressively trying to be a technology
and consulting firm first and a card
network second. They are pitching banks
on serviceled relationships. They want
to run a bank's loyalty program, manage
its cyber security defense, and consult
on where to open up new branches. So,
they're saying that they're going to be
like this entire consulting firm.
They're going to kind of take over the
operations of the bank, and they'll also
just throw in their card network as a
bonus. That is very different than what
Visa is doing. The pitch, hire us to run
your entire back-end tech stack, fraud,
loyalty, data, and oh, by the way, issue
our cards. Visa strategy is very
different. They are the network scale
strategy. Visa competes by emphasizing
its massive scale and reliability. Its
value added service offerings are often
to tighter the transaction itself like
dispute resolution, risk scoring, and
payment processing optimization. The
pitch with Visa is we have the biggest,
most reliable and most accepted network.
Our services ensure that your payments
never fail and your fraud is low. Stick
with the leader. Both of these companies
are leaning into different categories.
Now, Visa and Mastercard compete
aggressively. You'll notice that some
banks have exclusive relationships with
Visa, like JP Morgan. And then you have
some banks that won't have exclusive
relationships with either. They'll issue
some of either cards. In those cases,
they just want the benefits of both. But
both of them are growing because global
digital payments are growing. And
there's major tailwinds for both of
these companies. After all, there's
still trillions of dollars in cash
that'll eventually be moved to digital
payments. And Mastercard is positioning
itself, I think, in a very advantageous
way where they're going to grow
naturally and organically throughout the
world, throughout Europe, throughout
emerging markets into places where
there's going to be more digital
payments. But they're also positioning
themselves in many ways to be like a
palunteer of banks. I know it's a crazy
comparison, but the more you think about
it, the more it makes sense. They are
becoming this overall digital platform
that has an immense amount of data that
uses that data to look for things like
fraud to verify its customers and to
make consulting decisions for expansion.
This is a company that's leveraging its
immense data to grow a business 20 plus%
even at their already massive scale. So
we have Visa, Mastercard competing with
the banks trying to get as big of scale
as possible. They're also competing for
fintech and smaller companies that will
eventually grow to large institutions.
And they're competing for scale in their
payment processing. But remember,
Mastercard is not going for just scale.
They believe there's a bigger
opportunity and a bigger growth path by
this consulting arm becoming the
operating system for global commerce.
And they've already built out an
incredible, incredible business doing
so. I believe from here on it's just
going to be executing. And this isn't
something where they're only targeting
banks. In fact, a lot of their customers
aren't banks. Their first big customer
with this SAS company is government.
Mastercard is effectively a government
contractor for digitalization and cyber
security. Mastercard now sells threat
intelligence directly to 45 national
governments, including the US and
allies. You have dispersements. They
build the backend for the government to
send welfare, pension, or emergency
relief payments directly to citizens
bypassing checks. So they're not only
selling uh cyber security and threat
intelligence to governments, they're
also just building the backbone of
financial payments in the government.
Then you have tourism analysis.
Governments hire Mastercard to analyze
spending patterns and tourists to better
target advertising and infrastructure
and planning. So you can see how that
can be useful. If the government wants
to spend a billion dollars to, you know,
build up a national park or advertise
some part of their their country, they
want to know what tourist habits look
like. These are important decisions.
Retailers rely on Mastercard for
consulting because literally the only
other people that can do what they do is
Visa. They're the only ones with the
data. They have this massive duopoly
that they can leverage. They have test
and learn software. Software that tells
retailers exactly what will happen if
they change a price, open a store, or
run a promotion. And this is how this
works. Unlike general consulting firms
that use models or surveys, Mastercard
uses anonymized transaction data. It
doesn't guess if a Starbucks promotion
cannibalizes sales at a nearby Duncan.
It sees the card swiping at both
locations in real time and allows for a
closed loop attribution that Google and
Meta can only dream of. Now, this is a
data advantage so good that Google and
Meta could only dream of having it. Now,
that seems a little crazy. After all,
isn't Google and Meta like the data
companies? Don't they know everything
about everything? Well, not really.
Mastercard actually knows more. They
know more about where people spend money
because they actually know exactly when
you swipe a transaction, the exact place
you were, the exact merchant, the exact
amount you spent, and when you did it,
exactly for almost everyone, the sample
size in this case is so massive, it's
like half of society, that they can
track it with extreme levels of
accuracy. And what it's saying here is
that basically a normal consulting firm
can say that you can lower prices on a
product and you can see sales go up or
you can raise prices on a product and
maybe see sales stay the same. But what
happens to the restaurant next to you?
What happens with their sales? The
consulting firm isn't able to see that.
With the closed loop of Mastercard, they
can see not only how your business is
having its sales affected, but how a
nearby competitor is having its sales
affected at the exact same time. They
can look and say, "Hey, your sales are
going up, theirs are going down, or
theirs are going up." And they know
100%. Because everybody using their
cards at that location is feeding them
that data. That is a wide moat
advantage, one that can't be replicated
unless you build a network as big as
Mastercard. The only other company in
the world is Visa, which Mastercard has
capitalized on this intelligence
business and on this consulting arm. And
again, this is just one example of how
incredible these advantages are and why
this large business is growing 20 to 25%
per year. We look at other things and
there's so many features and things that
are unique to Mastercard that we could
highlight. Dynamic yield,
personalization, they have network
levers like the recorded future and
network data. They're combining their
data with cyber security identity
verification. They have the
pre-transaction identification which is
a massive moat. And Mastercard
productizes all of these different
products. They sell them as standalone
products to any company just like a SAS
company. Once these companies build
these products into their flow, they're
deeply embedded. So this revenue growth
isn't only fast, but it's also very
reliable and very predictable. Now
looking at that and looking at the mode
of Mastercard, the developments of this
company, going from a payment network
company to a cyber security consulting
arm, this is a company that has so many
ways to grow, so much power behind what
it's doing. And it's trading today at a
28 Ford PE. To me, that's not an
expensive price, especially for one that
has 45% profit margins with operating
leverage. It's also trading at a 3.6%
free cash flow yield. In fact,
Mastercard has gone nowhere this year.
It's literally flat year to date. It's
traded down over the past month. Why?
For no particular reason, just because
it's not AI. Mastercard isn't an AI
company. Nobody wants to own this old
stodgy company. It may be leading in all
these different categories and growing
incredibly fast and has high margins,
but for whatever reason, it's getting
left behind. The market doesn't care
about it. Well, I haven't forgot about
it. And I like the company. I like the
business. I like the direction. I like
the way that they're pivoting. I like
the consulting arm. I like all the
services they're building. I like that
it's super wide moat and it's developed
a side SAS business. It's growing above
20%. I like everything about it and I
even like the valuation. When we look at
the discounted cash calculator, we can
look at the valuation of the company and
make some simple assumptions. Basically
any assumption that I make. If
Mastercard trades at a 35 PE ratio and
grows only at 15%, then you get a 15.8%
return over the next 5 years. The stock
price would double. This would be a
market beating position. But
Mastercard's more likely to grow at 20%
earnings per share. So you're going to
get a 21% growth rate. 21% KGER.
Mastercard will be $1,360
by the first quarter of 2030. We can
switch over to the cash flow and do it
based on its free cash flow per share.
We look at this and again I assume a
simple 20% free cash flow per share
growth over the next 5 years. It's
growing at rates 25% and above. If we
assume that it goes to a 3% yield, which
is appropriate for this company, we get
a 25% return over the next 5 years. The
stock price would be $1,570
by Q1 of 2030. Right now, it's at $526.
I am buying Mastercard. I'm going to buy
another $10,000 of it. In fact, I have
money being transferred into the
brokerage today. I'll probably execute
the buy tomorrow and then I'm going to
be transferring another $10,000 in,
buying another $10,000 of this company.
and I don't mind building this position
bigger and bigger because right now I
believe it's one of the best
riskadjusted companies in the market.
Now, let's go and move on to some news
here. The biggest news, of course, is
the Nvidia earnings. Let's go ahead and
share some thoughts about it. We have
Nvidia reporting earnings and it's one
of those situations where I hear this
every single quarter and frankly I'm a
little bit tired of hearing it that
Nvidia is the whole market and the whole
market's dependent on Nvidia. But that
is kind of the situation. the market
does rely on Nvidia because all the big
tech companies that have been leading
the market are intertwined with Nvidia
to some degree, but I think that I I
think that this is becoming lesser of a
story over time. There's people like
this chief investment officer Scott
Martin saying quote this is a so goes
Nvidia, so goes the market kind of
report. Analysts expect the chip
behemoth to show more than 50% growth in
both the net income and revenue in its
fiscal third quarter. The reason is
fairly straightforward. Microsoft,
Amazon, Google, and Meta, which taken
together represent more than 40% of
Nvidia's sales, are projected to
increase their combined AI spending by
34% over the next 12 months to $440
billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. So, these four customers
represent over 40% of Nvidia's sales.
Now, there's lots of quotes here of
analysts saying that they're concerned
that these companies are continually
raising investors expectations. They're
raising the bar. they have to feed the
market with rising expectations and it
is a dangerous game for public companies
to play. So, it's like the the antie is
always getting upped and up. It's like
you're doubling down on your bets in
Vegas and eventually it's not going to
pan out. Now, I actually disagree with
this. I think that Nvidia is not just
trying to up the Annie, but they're
fulfilling on demand. And right now
there's such an insatiable demand for
artificial intelligence, for all this
processing and the efficiency that can
happen from it that it's a real product
with real demand. This isn't something
that's hyped up that they're trying to
just build momentum. They're trying to
describe how excited they are about a
real phenomenon going on. And I believe
that this quarter Nvidia is going to be
fine. The reason that I choose not to
invest in it is because I have some
persistent concerns about this company.
One of them is that Nvidia is a company
where its own customers, like it noted
here, 40% of its revenue comes from only
four different companies. Those
companies are trying to mitigate
Nvidia's impact. They're trying to
essentially replace Nvidia. Google's
doing it with its TPUs. We have Amazon
doing it with its tranium. All of them
internally are trying to develop their
own chipset to train and do different
things that Nvidia previously has done.
But I don't love the dynamic where your
own customers are actively trying to
replace you. It's a bit like if we
looked at ASML and every single customer
of ASML was actively working on building
their own lithography machine. They were
developing it. They were putting huge
infrastructure into it and they're
eventually going to build their own
lithography machine. Well, it's a bit
like what these customers are doing with
Nvidia. Google's TPUs are highly
effective. They've already shown with
their Gemini 3 that they can train the
best models with their TPUs. This is
also a big selling point. So, I see this
as just one long-term concern about
Nvidia. I believe the cloud companies
themselves are better riskadjusted bets.
Now, moving on, we get to what I
originally intended to be the fail of
the week, but after reviewing it, I
decided it would be the win of the week.
Let's go ahead and take a listen here.
This is someone from Tik Tok. Don't know
who it is, but she uploaded this take
and went viral as as now a lot of people
seem like they're figuring out
investing. Let's go ahead and just take
a look. Guys, I'm literally shaking
right now and I got to share this with
somebody because I don't think that
people know that the average person
right now can make a lot of money. We're
talking about millions. Okay. No, I
don't have a course to sell. No, this is
not a sponsored video. Do you remember
how back in the day people made their
wealth because they bought a lot of
properties when properties were like $5,
right? Those days are unattainable now.
But our equip Okay, so there's there are
some exaggerations here. I'm you can
make millions, right? That's always a
bit of an exaggeration. Anytime somebody
starts off their pitch with you can make
millions, that usually is a bit of an
exaggeration. Obviously saying that
homes back in the day were $5. Bit of an
exaggeration, but you get the point.
She's trying to make a point here. Let's
go ahead and just take a listen.
>> Equivalent to that is literally
investing in the stock market with
what's going on with AI and tech. Okay?
Because we literally, if you're an adult
right now, you have a front seat to
what's going on and seeing how our world
is literally changing right before our
very eyes. You know how before people
would say, "Damn, if I invested $1,000
into Starbucks in the 90s, I'd be a
millionaire." If I invested $1,000 into
Amazon in the '90s, I'd be a
millionaire. This is our opportunity for
that. What is happening right now was
literally something that's like for a
lot of people, it's going to be once in
a lifetime. This is going to be a time
that people will be jealous of in the
future cuz they'll be like, I was 8
years old when that was happening. I
didn't know that. I couldn't I couldn't
do that. Right.
>> She's right. I I think she's right. I
agree with everything. You look at some
of these companies and it's true that if
you invested in Starbucks early on,
Walmart early on, Home Depot early on,
you would have become a millionaire if
you just held those shares. In fact, I
know someone, a relative that bought
$2,000 worth of Apple stock in 2002,
soon after they launched the Apple iPod,
I believe it was. At that time, he
thought it was a great company. He held
that $2,000 from then until now, and
it's well over a million dollars. So,
there are investments you can make early
on. If you identify the right companies,
a little bit of luck, and you hold
long-term, you can make a lot of money.
So, this video was originally something
where a lot of people are reacting,
saying, "Oh, it's time to sell. Normal
people are finding out about the stock
market." I'm all for it. I think they
should. I think investing is exciting,
and I like everything about this
message. That's why it is the win of the
week. That's going to be it for this
episode. See you in the next one.
