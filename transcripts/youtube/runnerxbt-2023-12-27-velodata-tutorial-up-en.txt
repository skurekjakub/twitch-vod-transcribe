hello and welcome to another video my
name is Runner xbt and today we will
talk about Vel dat again this is second
tutorial but the purpose of the second
video is to update new functionality and
new tools so let's get straight into it
so this is a website all the links will
be in
description
V.A also I want to mention I not
affiliated with vataa I not paid to make
this video this is just a me recording a
video that was popular and done well so
here at the main page you have official
email address you have their official
Twitter
accounts it is verified so don't be
fooled and also you can check the
documentation which I highly recommend
before you start using the
app there's two big buttons
API which you can read all about I'm not
the developer
so and open app what is also worth
mentioning is that site works well on
mobile and when you bookmark it you can
add it to your home screen so it pretty
much uh works as an app on your phone to
use the Vel data you need to have an
account or you can sign up there's a
link in the
description your screen should look
something like this you can switch
between
light and dark
mode I'll stick to dark because I'm not
a sociopath
and there is as you can see five buttons
so I'll start from Trad FY and I'll work
my way
up here as you can see there's six
windows and all show CME data for either
Bitcoin or
E so I'll stick with
Bitcoin there's Bitcoin CME Futures open
interest CME Futures volume annualized
basis options open interest options
volume and gbtc premium all these charts
but will by default show you one year
time frame which you can change over
here so if I change it to 3 month it
will change for all six of them but if
maybe for some reason you want to have
only one of them edited you just do it
individually above each
window you can also have the charts
displayed in coins instead of
dollars because as price of Bitcoin goes
up it might eventually be benefit IAL to
look at open interest in coins instead
of dollars as it's less noisy and above
each chart there are three
buttons so first one is to save a
screenshot to your computer second one
is to save a copy so if I was to then
paste it anywhere I would upload this
image and third one is via API
access so let's move
on to
Market in this section you can see eight
different windows
date Windows being return buckets price
changes open interest change that's very
useful for Traders to see what the
activity actually is oi normalized cvd
funding APR heat map funding as a table
Market volume and total open
interest by default you'll see large cap
and one we time frame you can choose
whatever option you like by clicking on
this drop- down menu
for this video I'll go with top gainers
and 1
hour again these settings can be very
useful for day Traders because they can
see top performing coins of the last 60
Minutes third third part is
options since I'm not an options Trader
and do not actively utilize options data
I will simply screw scroll through this
tab you can add Greeks over
here you can you can look at most traded
options in the last 24 hours and you can
see all sorts of IV meaning implied
volatility
data button number four
Futures here you can pick between all
coins available on
Vel those are all binance usdt
futures for this example I'll pick a c
currently popular coin
salana Vel shows you over here market
cap fdv and also category where the coin
belongs in this case Solana being a
layer one if I do sets just to Showcase
it will show
brc2 so over here we can see 24 hours
volume open interest snapshot by Ma
major exchanges funding rate open
interest price chart cvd oi normalized
liquidations historical volumes average
returns by r& day cumulative return
returns
possession so in this example I can see
that in the last 7
Days uh Solana went up mostly during us
session most volume is done on binance
there is no
surprise and Biggest Gainer has been
around actually around this time as I'm
recording right
now so Lana price again you can change
all the
settings as you
want above and
beyond and last but not least
chart this is the part I personally
utilize the most firstly I want to talk
about the watch list on the right side
you can do this by dragging in here from
the right to the
left as you can see fully
adjustable here if you click on this
button these are settings and you can CH
choose up to eight columns here as a day
trader you can you might want to choose
the columns that are very useful for you
so as a day somebody trading alt coins
intraday 10- minute change 7-Day change
10 minute volume and if I keep adding
columns as you can see it will give me
error maximum eight so I can save it I
can drag it out and if I click at the
top it will filter the biggest gainer
from layer once in last seven
days what I can also do is create my own
new watch
list and I can add start adding coins so
let's do
salana
and I can save
it as you can see I can only see the
coins from the uh from the watch list I
created when it comes to watch
list and you click on the settings and
then you uncheck either you uncheck all
the watch list and favorites only then
it will show you all the pirs listed in
here so that can be handy if maybe you
don't want to have any watch list you
just want to have all the coins
available
market and if I scroll down I can now
here select from top gainers I can
collect my Val tutorial so I can
basically utilize my personal watch list
in this section as
well I hope that makes sense let's go
back to
chart okay let me close these for a
second when it comes to the chart alone
this is the classic trading view layout
by clicking settings tab you can change
the color of the candles body swix and
background so this over here you can
change the colors as you like I
personally like this color
scheme the chart is we're currently on
is Bitcoin usdt binance Futures if you
want to change it you can either start
typing or you can click here and do the
same
now I will walk you through how to add
most commonly used orderflow indicators
because that's what I do so to add
indicators you click on indicators over
here and I'll give you a list of
indicators I use and in order I
personally use them so for the most part
we will use all the aggregator
aggregated
data aggregated
liquidations open interest spot
volume volume and
funding where is
it some of you might recognize that
there's there are cvds missing so I'll
show you these are actually volume and
spot volume spot volume being the spot
cvd so I'll show you how to change it so
you have to hover over it
settings and click view change view to
cumulative
Delta now this is your spot
cvd I'll do the same for this one
and often you might have seen on CT a
lot of people having them over each
other so you go over three
dots visual order sorry move on existing
pain above and here we go here is the
look I wanted to
have if you want to move some of the
paints around you can just use these
arrows up and
down and if if I personally am pretty
annoyed by these text at the left you
can click at this arrow and this is much
cleaner
look
they're also adjustable by size like
this also when it comes to indicators
it's not just volumes and cvds that are
adjustable there's a lot of settings and
functionality with within most of them
so let me go ahead and add open interest
and I'll show you around so as of right
now it's showing me open interest in
coins I can click on settings and I can
click it to dollars I can you know
there's basically a lot of flexibility
when it comes to pretty much all
indicators
available one thing I would also like to
highlight is here you can have up to you
can have several charts at the same time
so maybe you want to have Bitcoin at
left and right ethereum or any other
altcoin as many as you
like and that's it for the tutorial
thanks for watching
