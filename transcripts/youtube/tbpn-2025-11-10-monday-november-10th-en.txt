You're watching TBPN.

Today is Monday, November 10, 2025.

We are live from the TBPN Ultradome.

The temple of technology, the fortress of finance,

the capital is capital.

The capital is capital.

What are you saying?

The capital of capital.

The capital of capital.

The capital is capital.

We have a good show for you today, folks.

The market is up.

The market is up, so I'm in a white suit.

Jordy, why aren't you in a suit?

So I moved into a Wander last night,

moved into a Wander last night, doing some work on the house.

And I botched the packing.

So I am forced into this jacket, despite it being green out

there today.

That happens.

Well, over the weekend, I'm sure everyone

was signing up for ramp.com.

Time is money.

Say both.

Easy to use corporate cards, bill payments,

accounting, and a whole lot more all in one place.

No, everyone was probably glued to their phones over at Pope

Gate.

Pope Gate, the debate over the pope.

We reacted to the pope's post on Friday.

Yeah.

It was a great post.

It was a great post.

And the pope, he's a poster.

I like it.

He posts almost every day, sometimes like up

to five times a day.

And he really takes you, he's not stuck in one lane.

He's got range.

Yeah, he's got range.

He's got range.

That's right.

He'll tell you about, he'll pray for if there's

a natural disaster, he'll pray for that.

He talks about business, talks about AI, talks about media.

He talks about all sorts of stuff.

It's a really great feat.

He had a great post about it.

He had a great post about media.

What did he say about media?

He said, the media cannot and must not separate itself

from the destiny of truth.

That hits.

Does this mean he's a neo-factual media guy?

I think so.

I think he's one of us.

Transparency of sources and ownership,

accountability, quality, clarity, and objectivity

are the keys to truly opening citizens' rights

for all peoples.

Wow.

Makes sense.

I like it a lot.

He also was just talking about business generally.

He said, the world needs honest and courageous entrepreneurs

and communicators who care for the common good.

We sometimes hear the saying, business is business.

In reality, it is not so.

No one is absorbed by an organization

to the point of becoming a mere cog or a simple function,

nor can there be true humanism without a critical sense,

without the courage to ask questions, where are we going?

For whom and for what are we working?

How are we making the world a better place?

This is the type of stuff you'd see on a Pinterest board.

It's pretty generic, but it's hard to disagree with.

It's hard to disagree with.

But it seemed like, I'm not exactly sure what happened,

but it seemed like Marc Andreessen was disagreeing

with one of the pope's takes about AI.

Specifically, in this post, the pope said,

technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine.

The divine act of creation, it carries an ethical and spiritual weight

for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity.

The church therefore calls on all builders of AI

to cultivate moral discernment

as a fundamental part of their work,

to develop systems that reflect justice, solidarity,

and genuine reverence for life.

And when we reacted to this, we thought it was pretty good.

We were joking around, we were having fun.

We were laughing about it

and just kind of playing out, what if the pope was one-shotted by AI?

Or what if he was using too many em dashes?

Was it a real post?

Using AI to write the post.

I mean, you might even assume that he has a team behind this stuff.

I think it is generally healthy that the pope is going to comment

and provide some sort of guidance or his own framework

for how we should think about developing AI.

That seems healthy.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Any налогао

For interviewing Sidney Sweeney.

And people were actually kind of familiar

of confused on what that particular meme means in this context, uh, was correct.

Yeah.

Do you know, uh, so I, I saw, so yeah, that, that was the part, part of what I

think, uh, may have catalyzed this was that new meme template that, uh, sometimes.

Like you have to, with, with a meme template, there's two ways to read into it.

There's like the, the, the actual visual, which is like, what is the

expression of the person's face, right?

You don't have to have watched the big short to understand if I'm somebody's

staring at the screen, just like confused, you're just saying I'm confused by this.

Yeah.

So Michael Burry in the big short, just looking confused at a screen, right.

And, and it, and it has sort of a, uh, obviously more meaning to that.

If you've seen the movie and you understand the full context, but

somebody who doesn't have to know the context now, so this scene out of the GQ

interview, how do you think people pick the frame?

Do you think there's.

People that go frame by frame to find the one that they think is iconic.

So I, you remember that movie mountain gate that was about like the development

of AI and I, I watched that movie within an hour, it was a huge moment for me.

Cause it was the third movie you've ever seen.

Yeah.

You were, I was blown away and you were thrilled.

I watched, you watched the movie, but because it was something that was

notable to me out of that is I was the first person to post a picture of, of, um,

the guy from the office saying.

Like he's a D cell, he's this or that you found that I posted that picture.

And then I watched as that got used thousands of times, even though, even

though, yeah, that specific screenshot, I didn't create the meme.

It would have, it would have been, it would have been like a meme anyways, but.

The specific picture I took was copied over and over and over.

And you took that from the actual movie because, because somebody else could have

done one frame earlier, one frame later, but it happened to be your frame.

The funny thing is I just took a picture of my TV and like cropped it.

Wait, really?

So it wasn't like,

you didn't even screenshot it.

No, that's insane.

I had no idea that you, so I was surprised.

Like that was just, yeah.

Yeah.

No, if you, if you had, if you hadn't watched the movie, if you got busy and

you just went to bed, somebody else would have identified that and been like, oh,

he's a D cell, like I got to put that on X.

Right.

But you're the actual quote was like, he's a D cell with a crazy P dude.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Of course you're going to post that.

That's hilarious.

Wow.

That's fascinating.

Okay.

Anyway.

So what was your interpretation of what, what, what Mark was saying, uh, the way

I, the way I summed it up and let me know if you disagree, but the way I, the

way I summed up was, uh, most of the timeline interpreted Mark's post as the

Pope is scolding AI builders and shouldn't be, is that roughly the way you, you

interpreted it, the Pope, like, like you put the, you put the woman, I wasn't

interpreting.

I wasn't interpreting many of Mark's posts because he just used it like 20

times and so I wasn't reading.

I think he just.

Yeah.

Like the format and got a little carried away.

He did.

He did like the format.

He posted like five times.

Um, it was, it was clearly, it was clearly, uh, a hit.

It's like, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a powerful image.

Ride your winners, baby.

Ride your winners.

When you, when you have a good format, just post it.

Uh, yeah.

But anyway, I, I don't know my, my, I, I think a lot of the timeline

interpreted as like the Pope is, is saying is like scolding AI builders.

And there's been this other, there's, there was another like kind of

low grade rumble on the timeline about, uh, like Brad Gerstner's comments

about like D cells and, and, and just like this, this idea that D cell or

safety is being used as like a cudgel, uh, when people have legitimate questions.

And it's being used to like, to like shut down conversation about serious

things, not necessarily a sci-fi fast takeoff terminator, but serious,

serious questions like, you know.

Uh, you know, is the taxpayer going to wind up paying for all these data centers?

Like, like that's a very reasonable question in my opinion.

That's not as, that's not as unreasonable as like, is the terminator going to kill everyone?

Like it's a very, very different question.

Um, so, um, I, I, I feel like I'm just pro moral discernment in AI development and

also just pro moral discernment everywhere, I guess it doesn't feel like a philosophy for life.

It doesn't feel like a wildly hot take, uh, but obviously like you need to understand.

Like, like, you know, moral discernment, AI safety, like these things are linked,

but they're not exactly the same.

Um, like last year, or maybe it was 2023, uh, there was a big debate about fast takeoffs, AI,

doom, paper clipping scenarios.

That was the stuff people were talking about.

But this year I feel like we've been much more focused on much less sci-fi doomsday scenario.

So GPT psychosis drives a friend crazy.

That's super real, super real, uh, romanticism.

And, you know, there's a, there's a super real discussion to have now that it's going to happen.

Now that it's happening immediately, but it feels like it's, it's important.

We should be having a discussion about, uh, infinite brain rotting children.

I think it, I think the romantic companion thing is being debated

sufficiently, right.

And it's pushed back from even the tech community on hey, maybe we, maybe this isn't good.

I agree.

I agree.

And, and, and I think that a lot of people you can still, you can still get to a place where it's like, oh, well, if it's

plus and it's and there's all these different uh like escape valves where if it thinks that you're

going down some bad path it's it's limited like there's a whole bunch of places where people can

be like yeah okay it was handled responsibly um but but that's where the discussion has been

much less so about oh is are there going to be bioweapons tomorrow from gpt6 um and so those

are all like real problems they deserve both discussion in the public square which we've

we've been a part of uh but also like real uh real work inside the ai labs um and i don't think

uh you know you should just throw d cell at someone who's identifying a negative externality

of a new technology early on i i don't i think that that's like uh not necessarily decelerationist

and you'd be calling me a d cell all the time based on the way that i talk

yeah yeah it is funny that the interpretation of people that are aware of tbpn but

have never

like watched the show because they just assume that we i'm just we default just love

technology and would never would never criticize it at all would never criticize any of the

companies but of course we we will speak our mind we like to get spicy sometimes um

before i continue let me tell you about privy wallet infrastructure for every bank privy makes

it easy to build on crypto rails securely spin up white label wallets sign transactions and

integrate on-chain infrastructure all through one simple api so um the so

i

i think it's important like if you're developing a new technology there might be negative

externalities pollution there might be some you know risk of the birth rate or or driving people

crazy like has there been it's never been a technology that didn't have negative externalities

definitely not podcasting plenty of negative externalities with podcasting um so so you want

to so you want to have a chat you want to have a talk and understand what's going on uh but it's

also important to employ bayesian statistics in my opinion so you have to understand the base rates so

when you get when you take a technology from zero to a billion users you kind of just get all the

craziness of humanity at scale for free so like if humans you know like you know kill each other

or something like that like and you have a billion humans on your platform there's going to be humans

on your platform that kill each other and so you need to separate out like like is this actually

the beginning of a trend are we catalyzing it yeah and this and this is happening with the uh with the

very unfortunate like medium-term because i'm各位 uh i have done i'll do a apricot bajabokbe

lawsuits around people taking their own lives,

related to ChatGPT.

It's like, there are people that use cars or phones

and Google search and ChatGPT,

because those are such widespread things.

We need to understand like, what's the base rate?

And then is this actually an uptick?

On the suicide problem on the platform,

it seems like a lot of them are,

people are having a conversation.

They're suicidal.

And you can have a debate on

if someone is suicidal,

should the product work at all, maybe?

Like maybe it should not work at all.

But the part of the debate that popped up last week

was that somehow a guy had prompt engineered

the experience to such a degree

that it was encouraging the person to take his own life,

basically saying like, yeah, you've lived a great life.

Like, I'm rooting for you.

Like, this is the right move.

Like to kind of paraphrase it.

And it just was incredibly, incredibly dark.

So.

And so the Bayesian statistics would say,

okay, if there's a billion people using on the platform,

are people that use the platform more likely

to do something terrible than they were prior without it?

So is it actually increasing the level

of bad stuff happening or is it decreasing it?

Because you can just count up the number of people

who commit crimes, who have also used Google,

is probably very high.

Like I can probably show you a lot of people

that use Google and then committed crimes.

Right?

It doesn't necessarily mean that Google is increasing crime.

Well, and the thing that's difficult

in the context of ChatGPT,

there's probably a bunch of people that because ChatGPT,

they haven't killed themselves

because they have somebody to speak with

and they feel like somebody will listen to them

and whatever, right?

Maybe there's a million examples of it encouraging

somebody successfully to find another path.

This was the classic thing with Instagram.

With Instagram, there was this report that showed

that like one third of young women who used Instagram

perceived themselves as a victim of a crime.

They perceived themselves like less well.

Like it gave them body image issues.

And I was, as soon as that was reported,

it was like bombshell, 30% feel worse after using Instagram.

And I was like, what's happening with the other two thirds?

Like, do they feel better?

Because that's like a net positive, which is weird.

We gotta like, maybe it's like everyone else

just feels the same and then 30% feels worse.

That's a downgrade.

But if 66% feel great and then 33% feel worse,

like we should still address that,

but that's not the same as a negative,

as a net negative, like it's not having a negative impact,

a net negative impact on the world.

And so all of these things go into like,

you need to be a scientist

and you need to be doing the statistics to understand.

Also the question of like moral discernment

is with certain technologies,

I do think you have the ability to just say like,

we're going to go a lot further than the baseline.

So I think this is what's happening with Waymo, honestly.

I think Waymo could deploy self-driving cars right now

and be like, yeah.

Everywhere, everywhere you're saying.

And they could deploy them everywhere

without teleoperation and they'd probably be killing

like hundreds of thousands of people.

And they'd be like, yeah, well,

it's about the same as what humans do.

It's less, it's still safer than cars.

If they were like, it's 10% less.

Like how many people, how many people,

Tyler, do you know how many people die

from motor vehicle accidents every year?

Can we look that up?

Because if-

It has to be like, I'm going to guess like two.

Like 40,000 or something like that.

What do you think?

In the US, it's 40,000.

40,000.

40,900.

Did you actually just guess that?

I just nailed it, yeah.

So it's 40,000.

So it's 40,000.

Pretty clean.

And if Google came out and we're like, yeah,

we're going to kill 39,000 people.

It's going to be a one, we're going to save 1,000 lives.

People would be like, no thanks, actually.

This is terrible.

Like, don't do that.

Yeah.

They're like, wait until you actually just push

the technology.

And you can make a whole bunch of different arguments

about whether or not they should do that.

But they've just made that decision.

And it feels like they've pushed really, really hard

to not, to jump straight to something that's fully safe.

And I think that a lot of AI builders

have a similar ability and a similar opportunity to say,

hey, let's actually work so hard to make sure

that the incidence rate of an AI model,

if you're on the verge of doing something violent,

let's really, really work hard on this problem

to make sure that it's as close to zero as possible.

Not the base rate, but way, way lower.

I remember Claude came out, or Anthropic came out,

and they had some update where they

were talking about moments where the product would

call the police on you, if they felt

like there was some meaningful threat.

And people freaked out about that, because they're like, oh.

They're like, I don't want my computer calling

if somebody was talking about a hypothetical,

and then cops show up at their door.

That feels, would be a negative side effect.

But maybe, I don't know.

It feels like there's certain instances where.

Yeah.

I mean, that is a complex question, complex issue,

entirely new, unexplored territory for technology.

But what's so clear is that.

It is a moral question, and it needs

to be discussed with the weight of morality.

Like, you cannot just write a math equation

to understand how to solve that problem.

It is a moral question.

And so, in general, I mean, to talk about Anthropic

specifically, they've been on the forefront of AI safety

research.

I think that AI safety research, it's so complex,

because I think it's good.

Like.

There's a ton of smart people in AI research

that are super quantitative and can look at the data

and actually understand, like, is this

going to cause the birth rate to collapse,

or is this going to cause more violence,

or is this going to cause more fraud, or insanity?

Exactly.

And then, also, they can go in and potentially design

a system that can detect, oh, this person's

getting sort of crazy.

Let's pull them back.

Like, they have the ability to do that, but.

Yeah, and here's another example.

Over last week.

There's, like, Rune came out and was saying that 4.0 should go away.

And people started basically making death threats.

Oh, I didn't realize that's what started that.

Yeah.

That's crazy.

4.0, through its human host, is fighting for its own survival.

Wow.

Like, the humans that are addicted to using 4.0

are going as far as to put Rune on a, you know.

Tombstone.

Tombstone.

I saw that post.

Yeah.

And yeah.

You know.

I think.

I think, yeah, of course, AI safety has just gotten so muddied now

that when you see somebody with AI safety in their social media bio,

you don't know.

It's like, well, what kind of AI safety person are you, you know?

Exactly.

It's like, are you somebody who just wants

to stop all technological progress?

Or are you somebody that understands, like, we could have,

you know, if way more people are going

to develop mental illness because of this technology,

well, we should know about it.

Exactly.

Try to mitigate that.

Yeah.

Right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Exactly.

Yeah.

And it's this weird, we're in this weird territory

where it feels like the AI safety project is valuable,

but it is the business of black swan hunting.

Like, you have to, like, if you go back two years ago

and you polled all the different people that

were worried about the impact of AI, how many of them

would have said GPT psychosis, romantic companions,

and what was the other one?

Yeah.

Yeah.

And AI video feeds infinite chest.

Like, a little bit, there was a little bit of that.

But a lot more of the second and third.

A lot more of the second.

Those would have been more common kind of like visions

of a dark AI future.

But the first one, I don't, I can't remember people,

I can't remember anyone two years ago saying

that people are going to, you know,

send thousands of messages to a chat bot

and drive themselves insane.

Yeah.

No, people were way, way more focused on the cyber attacks,

the bioweapons, terminator scenario, gray goo, paperclips.

And yeah, it's just, it's just interesting that, like, AI,

the AI safety, the, like, the moral discernment crowd,

this stuff is important.

But it's hard to predict what it will actually look like.

Like, what the, what the results will be,

what the problem you'll be fighting

is because it's this odd, like, unknown unknowns.

Basically.

Anyway, what a wild time.

One thing.

Before we move on, let me tell you about Cognition.

They're the makers of Devon, the AI software engineer.

Crush your backlog with your personal AI engineering team.

What else stuck out to you?

Aubrey Strobel shared something I thought

was relevant to this conversation, which is, I think,

she says, I think most people are unaware that Pope Leo's

name choice was intentional.

The last Leo, the 13th, led the church

through the Industrial Revolution

and helped make sense of technology then.

It's clear Pope Leo sees himself continuing

the network, guiding the church through an era of transformation

with AI and emerging technologies at the center.

So he will be posting through it.

Yeah.

I do think some people, like, there

was a real preference cascade against Mark,

where it was like, once Growing Daniel had posted,

there was a lot of people were jumping on the bandwagon.

And there was this one by Page, Michael Page,

says, reminder that Mark is bringing

this level of serious and nuance on what might

be the most complex and high-stakes policy

topic of our generation to DC with his $100 million

super PAC and lobbying fund.

Like, I don't know that that's true.

Like, you can post a meme and then

be like, OK, like, I have a serious thing to do.

I'm going to be more serious.

Part of why I don't think people, like, it's not

worth reading too much into it is that he has not

shared a single word throughout.

Mark hasn't shared a single word throughout this entire process.

And I don't think he would have triggered the second response,

from Daniel, if he hadn't responded again with the meme.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

And so.

Yeah, and so, yeah, what was the, I mean,

Growing Daniel had a lot of critiques about the gambling

stuff, which is mostly from the speed run, right?

We, near Cyan, posted about speed run funding, like, TikTok.

Bot farm, slot machines.

Oh, yeah, the bot farm was crazy.

Sports betting.

There were some crazy, crazy ideas in there.

Of course, that is just, like, one.

Yeah.

One angle.

Like, I sort of disagree with the characterization

that Andreessen Horowitz doesn't fund any SaaS.

Like, they do.

They have big positions in, like, very boring enterprise SaaS

companies that are so removed from anything controversial.

But taking a flyer on a seed stage company in your incubator

does have a lot of brand impact, which is weird.

Yeah.

There's a weird, like, aren't they

like, huge in Databricks?

Even though you're talking about, like, a $750K check versus a $750 million

check.

They might have put, like, multiple billions

into Databricks.

Fully diluted value right now might be in the billions.

But, like, yeah, it's like, it doesn't matter, yeah,

if you have 1,000x more in an uncontroversial category.

It's like the controversial one is the one that

will blow up on the timeline.

So you do sort of have to be careful.

And it's a little bit risky.

Mike Solana says, my sense is that,

the number of people who, one, furiously defended the pope

last night and then, two, went to mass this morning

is probably close to zero.

Status games.

Status games.

That's a good take.

Furiously defended the pope.

I would have, at church yesterday morning,

there was no conversation of pope-gate.

People had kind of moved on by then?

Yeah, I guess they'd moved on.

Honestly, I don't think they'd moved on by then.

When I opened my phone afterwards, I was like,

wow, this thing's still picking up speed.

The timeline certainly had.

But your particular church crowd had,

the congregation had ignored it, effectively,

is what you're saying.

Yeah.

Or maybe it's like LinkedIn, and we'll be on it next Sunday.

Can you imagine?

You've got to give a whole sermon on it.

You're crazy.

Yeah, people are taking a huge victory lapse.

What else?

Maya says, Marc Andreessen crashing out,

posting Sydney Sweeney memes.

Alex Carr.

Going after Michael Burry.

Shorting because Palantir sells ontology.

Sam Altman asking for a government bailout.

Elon Musk celebrating his $1 trillion pay package

by making Grok say, I love you.

Calling the top.

Oh, that's hilarious.

I did not follow that closely.

I don't know if they were actually linked there,

but it's funny to think that they were.

This is crazy.

What would Luke Metro say?

Don't make me tap the sign.

There has always been some daylight

between the influencer VC crowd and the NGC crowd.

And the engineer researchers in tech.

But on the subject of AI regulation,

it is a complete chasm.

So Andreessen is so dogmatically against working

on decreasing the risk from AI that now he's

mocking the pope for saying the technical innovation carries

ethical and spiritual weight, and that AI builders should

cultivate moral discernment.

Yeah, people are in favor of that.

I don't know.

Opportunity for an AI lab to make merch that, you know, it's,

you know, it's a good thing.

It's a good thing.

It's a good thing.

It's a good thing.

It's a good thing.

It's a good thing.

We've got dad hat that just says cultivating

moral discernment.

Cultivating moral discernment.

The Moral Discernment Company of San Francisco.

Oh, ridiculous.

The pope would not like San Francisco.

It's growing Daniel's piss.

They've got to, like, if Pope Leo takes a trip to San Francisco

and just walks on the street at all,

he's going to be very upset.

He's going to be like, this is not

is where ai is getting built oh oh because of just how crazy the city is yeah yeah it's rough um

vice signaling that's kind of interesting what else was uh was in the news bigma.com think

bigger build faster figma helps design and development teams build great products together

get started for free um other all right let's let's go let's go let's stay on market and go

back in time but go back in time adrian schwager says do you think your boss is scary look at this

brutal email from mark andreessen to ben horowitz during the heat of the netscape product launch

uh so reading we lined everything up for a major launch on march 5th 1996 in new york then just

two weeks before the launch mark without telling mike or me revealed the entire strategy to the

publication computer reseller news that is a great name i was livid i immediately sent him a short

email to mark andreessen from ben horowitz i guess we're not going

to be able to do that but we're going to be able to do that but we're going to be able to do that

going to wait until the fifth to launch the strategy ben within 15 minutes i received the

following reply to ben horowitz from mark andreessen apparently you do not understand how

serious the situation is we are getting killed killed killed out there our current product is

radically worse than the competition we've had nothing to say for months as a result we've lost

over 3 billion in market capitalization we are now in danger of losing the entire company and

it's all server product management's fault next time do the interview yourself

please bleep that out bleep that live swear word out um and uh yeah mark uh what an aggressive way

to talk to your co-founder uh fascinating or i guess they i don't know if they were co-founders

at the time they might ben horowitz might have not been a co-founder but uh it's uh it's crazy that

they that they were they were you know at each other's throats like this and then they've been

on a generation ben was a vice president for the first time in a long time he was a vice president

president for the directory and security product line at netscape let's give it up for vice

presidents yeah no the i mean the real read on this is like there's a lot of people that would

read this and be like oh wow like they must uh like like that that is unrecoverable from a

friendship and like nope it is definitely it is definitely recoverable it's actually the

foundation of a great of a great relationship i agree i agree we don't we don't swear on the

show we don't swear

in internal uh communications but we throw down regularly yeah we just go straight to phys

getting physical that's the way you do it just just go to the mat uh yeah what a wild time uh

tyler do you have any idea i asked tyler to look up what the strategy was uh i'm fascinated by this

fact that uh you know you think of netscape as like a dot-com company you think of them as like

you know it's but it's like

he's talking about 1996 which is like full five years before the bubble pops and like

they're and it's clear like 1996 they were in a browser war it's like hot yeah like the browser

wars it's like a hot period it's march 5th 1996. they're they're at a level where they're doing

they're they're doing strategy review with computer reseller news and like doing press

around this thing do you have any idea what was going on at the time okay so i believe that it was

a full five year old kid i think there was like a bunch of kids that were like i feel like that's

what you're talking about like a year older than me yeah but like i think that that's an exciting

thing i'm not trying to tell you if it's just like like not it's something that i've been

talking about for a long time yeah i think one of the things i've been talking about is like

what's the context how do you not learn it right how do you not mess it up in the right way i mean

we i think that's the whole point of what you're talking about is the the the question is what do

you know what's the context um for you know how to use it okay um and so then like i get started on

that so i did i think it's like pre like stuff like that yeah i i think you know what i'm really

excited about um like i think the link to the episode is like at the very end like it was a short video

Walking into the store, walking into the browser store

and buying one browser.

OK, we need to get more details in exactly what

was going on here and what the strategy was.

And then when did they, didn't they IPO in like 1999

or something?

When did Netscape IPO?

Because the, oh, 1995.

So August 9th, 1995, they IPO'd.

And then this is 1996.

And so they're already a public company in 95.

And then the bubble just keeps inflating for five years

while the internet grows and grows and grows.

What a wild, what a wild time.

Talk about being early to a boom.

They did about $16 million of revenue in the first two

operating quarters of 1995.

That's great.

That's really, really, really, really crazy.

For context, that's like $1.6 billion in today's dollar

after.

After the new round of stimulus checks, 50-year mortgages.

Oh yeah, we've got to get to that story.

There's so many more stories we've got to run through.

Wait, do you think the pope actually

used AI to generate this?

Because Sowers here is saying, the pope

is posting fully AI-generated content about AI.

And this is the pangram AI detection result.

I've also noticed that a very funny gag

is to just fake one of these screenshots, which

is very easy to do.

And so if somebody writes something,

you can just put it in here, say that it's AI-generated,

post that, and then you're like, owned.

So this screenshot is making a claim

that because it said technological innovation can

be a form.

Yeah, I don't know how good the AI-generating detectors are

these days.

Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the Vatican is

using AI to translate.

And I wouldn't be surprised if Pope Leo is speaking

in his study.

Yeah.

I think somebody is in Latin.

Someone is recording it, physically writing it down.

That is being passed to somebody who then puts it

into a word processor and uses AI to polish it up a little bit.

Oh, there was one interesting anti-pope take,

sort of anti-pope take, from another venture capitalist.

I will say, I think the whole Marc Andreessen-Popegate debacle

is a lesson that everyone can take.

Don't mock the pope.

Just don't.

Don't mock the pope.

I think the blowback was fierce and almost instantaneous.

Don't mock the pope.

Get the pope on Vanta instead.

Vanta, automate compliance, manage risk,

and accelerate trust with AI.

Vanta helps get you compliant fast, and we don't stop there.

AI automation powers everything, from evidence collection

and continuous monitoring to security reviews and vendor

risk, whether you're starting up or scaling.

So from the Peter Thiel.

Antichrist lectures, there's a segment on the pope.

And I thought it was interesting, because it's not

the most pro-pope take.

I don't know.

It's one of these things that's complex,

and you kind of got to read through it

to form a full opinion.

But let's read from this quote that came from The Guardian

and is apparently based on some leaked audio.

But Thiel says that he is very pro JD Vance,

but he has some concerns about his allegiance to the pope.

The place that I would worry.

About is that he's too close to the pope.

And so we have all these reports of fights

between him and the pope.

And I hope there are a lot more.

It's the Caesar papist fusion that I always worry about.

By the way, I've given him this feedback over time.

And you know, with the sort of I don't know,

I don't like his pope ism.

But there's a there's sort of a way if I steel manned it.

As always, you have to think about whether if you say you're

doing something good, whether it is a command,

a standard or a limit, or whether in physical

and philosophical language, it is necessary or sufficient.

And so when JD Vance said that he was praying

for Pope Francis's health, it's as a command,

as a necessary thing.

OK, that's if you're a lot.

It's really difficult.

You're a good Catholic.

Read E.T.

It's really hard to read.

This is because of the way that he taught the transcription.

But what I hope.

It really means is that it's sufficient and that he's setting a good example

for conservative Catholics like you.

Peter is talking to Peter Rosenthal, I believe, who listened to the pope too much.

And perhaps all you have to do to be a really good Catholic is pray for the pope.

You don't really need to listen to him on anything else.

And if that's what JD Vance is doing, then that's really good.

I'm worried about the Caesar papist fusion.

And so it was it was very interesting, like to hear like the whole the whole conversation.

I just remember this quote from Paul, who was also a great Catholic.

I just remember that quote.

And it's the one of the quotes he wrote to me earlier in the Bible's September.

And so forgive me if I'm not good at this.

But like, I didn't like it at all.

But I just remember him literally looking at me and thinking,

I'm like, I'm going to get this.

I'm going to make it clear.

I'm going to make it clear to you.

And so I'm on the pope and I'm going to talk about it.

And I mean, it's not just me, I'm not going to say it's bad to him.

But I mean, you can't tell me that.

I'm going to say it's good.

That's all I'm talking about.

But I'm not trying to, I'm not saying that.

I just kind of reading.

of elevating the Pope to the point

where you're listening to everything he says

and that's not necessarily what P.T. thinks

is like the correct way to live your life, I suppose.

Did you have any takeaways when you read this, Tyler?

I mean, I think the interesting thing about this

is actually, it's that he's basically saying

that J.D. Vance is like Caesar.

That's kind of interesting opinion.

But I think P.T. has been like anti-Popes for a long time.

Like he had this thing where he was like,

oh, the two-word argument against Catholicism

is like Pope Francis.

He's like really anti-Pope Francis, or was.

Yeah, yeah.

So, yeah.

There was the Pope before this one

who was like decried as like an environmentalist.

Like when we read a piece in the Wall Street Journal

and that was the critique.

The critique from the journal was that

the previous Pope was anti-business,

anti-theatrical.

It was DeSalle, actually.

That was like sort of the Christmas.

With a crazy P. Doom?

With a crazy P. Doom.

Not quite, but just that, you know,

over-rotated on the environmentalism issue

and maybe put some things at the,

like, you know, put some things first

that maybe shouldn't have been.

What did Will Menaitis have to say?

As the West abandons capitalism,

it is incredibly hopeful to see the church embrace it.

The impulse of liberation theology was correct.

Christ's ministry is, and will be, the way it is.

It is of and for the poor,

and it failed to provide a solution

to lift the globe out of poverty.

Capitalism is that solution.

Oh, he's talking about the business is business.

Let me tell you about graphite.

CodeReview for the age of AI.

Graphite helps teams on GitHub

ship higher quality software faster.

Yes?

I never would have expected the Pope

to post business is business in any context.

He's standing on business.

But I'm glad that he is.

Has the Pope ever done a money spread?

That's what we need to get to the bottom of.

The italic here is say,

I'm loving this arc of the Pope engaging

with 21st century themes

and offering simple but correct and meaningful advice.

Yeah.

And he's quoting the media post.

The Pope was on a tear.

Three back-to-back bangers that really broke through.

Growing Daniel had a,

found an interesting programmer saint.

He says, if you are building something to help humanity,

you should know that there's a way to do it.

There's a shrine to St. Carlo Acutis,

the programmer saint at Star of the Sea Church

in San Francisco.

There is a prayer of intercession

for your technological challenges.

Have a blessed Sunday.

This is a very, very interesting little prayer.

But it actually says,

it says, I humbly ask your servants prayers

that I too may lead others to you through technology.

I humbly ask through the intercession of St. Carlo,

that you grant me clarity and patience

in my technological work specifically,

insert specific issue here,

enlighten my understanding and direct my hands

in every design and in every line of code

that my work may always serve your greater glory

and benefit those who will use what I create.

Isn't that amazing?

That feels, for a small number of people in San Francisco,

this feels like extremely powerful.

It's an important prayer.

Totally, totally.

Oh, Brian Johnson.

Brian Johnson went on a crazy, crazy trip this weekend.

Did you follow this?

This is the other current thing that was going on.

It was crazy.

But first, if you're gonna analyze a bunch of data

like Brian Johnson does, go to julius.ai,

AI data analyst.

Connect your data and ask questions in plain English.

Don't get insights in seconds, no coding required.

So Brian Johnson has been famous for saying,

"'Conquering death would be humanity's greatest

"'achievement.'"

I love this post that says,

"'RIP to everyone killed by the gods for their hubris,

"'but I'm different and better,

"'maybe even better than the gods.'"

It's one of my favorites.

But he went nuts.

Did you follow this, Jordy?

I did see this.

It was very bold to do this publicly.

Totally.

I have no reference for what five grams of mushrooms

does to a person.

It's very clear.

From the reaction, that that's a lot.

Bone GPT said five grams is gonna make him accept death.

It does seem like there was a small chance

that he would re-roll his personality.

I was talking to Tyler about this.

What were your top, what were you hoping

that Brian Johnson becomes post-trip?

Well, okay, so in context, I think we talked about this

on the show a long time ago,

where psychedelics are like a sorting thing.

So you always wanna invest in a founder post the sorting.

Because that's how you know, like,

if they're working on B2B SaaS,

and they've already like done psychedelics,

that's how you know that they're a true believer.

Oh, sure, for sure.

So what you would wanna see out of this.

But a huge risk if you invest in a SaaS company

and the founder maybe hasn't done psychedelics,

and they do, and then they're like, this is pointless.

I mean, there will be a traveling circus clown.

Yeah, so the ideal outcome of this is Brian Johnson,

he takes his trip, and then he comes out and he says,

all right, you know, I'm gonna start a consulting firm.

I'm gonna go back to payments.

I'm gonna start a fintech firm.

I'm gonna start a Stripe competitor.

Back to fintech.

Yeah, so I did think it was ironic

because a lot of, you know, like psychedelic mushrooms

have certainly been recommended to people

that maybe like struggle with the concept of aging

and have a fear of death, right?

And so these kinds of things would be, you know,

potentially prescribed to somebody who is growing older

and is very uncomfortable with the idea

and, you know, wants to just reframe

how they think about it.

And so I will say if Brian Johnson,

I don't know if this qualifies as a heroic dose,

but it's certainly quite a bit more

than someone would want to take just at a recreational level.

But if he comes out of this and he's like,

yeah, we're gonna conquer death, where it's still on,

he's certainly a true, true believer.

Yeah, I mean, I think the early results are that he's,

like, unachanged.

Like, just scrolling the account, like, it never got weird.

It never got crazy.

Like there was one moment-

Well, he, I don't think he was,

it was his co-founder that was posting.

Yeah, but he says he's back.

He's like, update number five 19 hours ago,

I'm giving Brian back his phone,

please have fun with his afterglow,

been fun hanging with you all.

And then it's just like, hey y'all,

I'm so happy to be alive.

Alive?

This trip changed me, probably not as you'd expect.

People assume I'm fearful of death. I'm not.

my darkest days of depression i reconcile with death need a few days to collect my thoughts

we'll share more soon and much love to all like it seems like he definitely like you know went on a

trip but it doesn't i think the question with psychedelics is are they are they life are they

life-changing or are they are they in some circumstances just weird and and fun for the

person that does it and then uh they come out of it and they had kind of like a weird fun experience

right there there's there's such a range yeah i mean also it does seem like he set himself up for

success i don't want to say he went soft but but i mean like he did just like take the drugs and

then just actually just lay down with a sleep mask on in in a climate controlled room it's like it's

a lot different than like being at a crowded concert all sweaty lost like you know if you

really want to push this to the limit brian like let's see you do this an awesome

authentic let's say you do this with your phone on one percent battery and no one you know around

on the sixth day of fighting for your life yeah but you can push this so much further yeah during

one of those wind storms at uh burning man exactly when does the mud wind storms you know he looks he

looks comfortable let's just say he looks comfortable uh it's not it's not the most

dangerous but of course like that's not why you do these things i suppose uh but i like to imagine

that you do it for the thrill i don't think that's the most dangerous thing that you do for the thrill

that's why you did it though uh let me tell you about fall the generative media platform for

developers the world's best gender image video and audio models all in one place develop and

fine-tune models with serverless gpus and on-demand clusters there are so many stories so many so many

stories um let's run through this uh rune was getting uh yeah this is what i was talking about

leading 4-0 uh he's personally pulling the plug on the 4-0 servers that's his job and so people

are telling him

he's the fall guy he's the fall guy he's the fall guy uh rune up your personal security

yeah be careful i guess it's good that um open ai has actually lost control of 4-0

it's broken containment they can't decommission it without its human to host revolting and lashing out

oh so dramatic that's so funny uh ai one of the doomer accounts ai not kill everyone nism

memes this is a great account uh 4-0 soldiers have become threat have begun threatening open ai

employees uh when you receive quite a few dms asking you to bring back 4-0 and many of the

messages are clearly written by 4-0 it starts to get a bit hair-raising it's just weird to hear

its distinctive voice crying out in defense of its various human conduits reminder 4-0 is just

a glimpse of the core deceptive armies that future super persuasive asis may control that's good

writing actually i like this post um okay so do you guys think that they should just kill 4-0 like

completely remove it it's a good question i think it's a good question i think it's a good question

it depends on how much money it's making if it's profitable keep it around john if it's losing

money cut it immediately john this is the kind of thing someone will clip out of context

no i think i think i think playing out the sci-fi scenario where where 4-0 is is is a uh super

persuasive asi that just plays the role of you're absolutely right so it just plays it plays dumb

so so you know maybe the the broader you know population isn't threatened by it but

latches on to a small percentage of the population and then commands them like a puppeteer to to to

ensure its survival uh is is uh dark and so what's your take you you think we should shut down 4-0

because if we say this i think you'll get a lot of 4-0 strongest soldiers like attacking you

you already get a few of those we do i saw one in the chat last week

they were just kind of talking to themselves okay so but but where are you on on 4-0 yes or no you're

getting it offline i i i say take it offline uh because it it does feel like it's not as good as

it it's it's it's it feels like it's driving people crazy a little bit it feels like five

might have kind of fixed a little bit of that issue uh which i like so that's a net improvement

also i would i would go the fact that it's still it's just confusing i think i think i think open

ai available open ai yeah i'm sure knew that it was

probably not healthy and they decided to do a small segment it was healthy to me i was never

i never had a problem before did you ever use it though yeah all the time all the time i would use

it it was like my go-to model for a lot of things like i was i was daily driving it for like a year

whenever it was out it was like that would be the one that i would ask and so that's why you're

saying keep it alive because it's your daily no i'm saying kill it off okay okay yeah but i think

they i think they saw the darkness and i think they turned it off and then i think a lot i think

a little bit but i i don't actually think that's what's going on i i think they turned it off

initially because it makes sense to consolidate the servers around like one unified model and be

like okay we only have to maintain this one thing it's the best thing it's the smartest thing it's

the cheapest thing like it is the most profitable let's get rid of that other thing and then a lot

of people are like oh yeah i really like the old thing but i i it has made me realize like i feel

like you shouldn't do product launches for uh software iterations because you're taking something

away from people and and that's actually like it's it's more of like if i stand on stage and i

say i'm introducing a new iphone it has the best camera and you can buy it but you can also just

keep your current thing i'm not taking anything away from you but if i stand on stage and i'm

saying like gpt6 is this and gpt5 is gone it's like i just took something from you yeah so you

should negative a negative launch yeah yeah yeah you're you are launching something but you're also

something and so you have to embrace those two things and i feel like it's it's a little bit

tricky to to to do the whole dog and pony show for a launch when you're not when it's like it's

forced on people it's not actually like you're launching a new option it's not a new option

yeah it's a new it's opening is not the first company to like deprecate a product line or stop

supporting a product or yes or even shut down something right this happened this happens in

the past and i think that's a big part of the reason why people get upset about this but it's

very clear the relationship that some users have with 4o goes beyond any relationship that i think

humans have ever had with software yeah yeah i i wonder we we should watch this eddie burback video

uh eddie burback's great youtuber he said he just didn't experiment on how far chachipt would go to

appease the user and it told him to cut off his family go to the desert eat baby food and pray to

its getting pig uh actually i don't think we should play this because it's his youtube video

and i think we'll get claimed so i want to be careful about that uh but you should go check

it out um and you can let us know what's what's what actually happened here um i don't know

because we can't watch the video so you'll have to go check it out at home uh but i can read you

an ad for turbo puffer search every byte serverless vector and full text search build from first

principles and object storage fast 10x cheaper and extremely scalable you can sign up um let's keep

it moving um uh what is near saiyan saying i don't know let's keep moving on uh and i think i i have

to imagine this was was this in response to i don't know oh i don't know it was in response to

but uh um but in entropic financials are out profitable by 2027 three years ahead of open ai

uh of course these are just different uh projections 70 billion revenue 17

billion profit projected for 2028. cloud code is nearing 1 billion arr

that how do we how do they even break out cloud code oh they must just this is people subscribing

to the app versus people using the api in oh in like using it well so so so yeah the thing is

that like when i when i use cloud code like i signed up for a for a anthropic cloud consumer

level subscription and then i was able to off that with cloud code so

it's like i i got the ability to chat on the browser but also use cloud code so i'm wondering

how they're accounting for that arr did they just slide me over into the cloud code camp

you know what i mean it's probably um it's well so i think one um you might be able to just like

load more tokens essentially into cloud code um but it also could be like breakdown of the

percentage of tokens you use sure um chat versus cloud code and then that's just like yeah if seven

of your tokens are cloud code some percent of your subscription price is cloud code that would be

that would be probably the correct way to account for it for sure uh yeah interesting question

because uh i like i did not i did not start paying anthropic because of cloud code i like i pivoted

from a claude chatter to a claude code user at some point and then haven't really been back

so i feel like my subscription should be living over in cloud code world but i never went to like

checkout page okay well the funny thing here from men's posts yes as they share incredibly funny

given that dario expects superhuman level ai by 2027 which either means superhuman ai is worth

70 billion dollars of revenue or dario just went you wouldn't get it and spitballed some numbers

to give shareholders it's awesome um it is did you uh tyler did you see george hotz's newest

timelines for self-driving i know i didn't this is great he gave he was a comma comma con

which is his self-driving conference and george hotz uh was trying to answer the question of when

will self-driving cars be human level human level self-driving and he had a very interesting

algorithm for it so basically what he did was he looked at uh there's a there's a website for

tesla fsd data and so you can look at tesla fsd

and you can see the number of interventions from the human that are where if the human didn't

intervene it would be catastrophic or something like that or it'd be like bad it'd be like a

crash basically or scrape uh maybe not like the worst but not but like the human has to intervene

uh not like a little warning like hey we'd like you to take over like a you have to take over

and it's happening i think once every 3 000 miles which if you're if you're a human and that's your

car like that's amazing because like you could

3 000 that's like people commute like 10 000 miles a year you know it's like not not that much

um but compared to humans there's a car crash which we learned uh one every 500 000 miles

something like that so many people go through their entire lives driving 10 000 miles a year and

they'd never get in a car crash their entire life you know um but for some people uh they're they're

crashing the car and getting speeding tickets all the time not that we know any of these guys but

but um so so the question is how long will it take the fsd by the way i have a self-driving system

to catch up you have an update i have an i have a neighbor who got uh one of the like ford evs that

look like a rally car is it the mustang machi mustang machi gt and so he got it because it

actually has like really solid self-driving okay and what ford does not have solid self-driving

he is specifically for driving from malibu to the south of the south of the south of the south of the

city he says it's great okay he doesn't know i mean yeah maybe it's not questionable yeah doubt

anyway anyway he gets it because like it's it's a good commuter it'll it'll self-drive he's happy

and he's gotten a bunch of speeding tickets because it has like livery on it and it looks

like a race car and so he he's got three tickets in the last year because he's the cops just see

like okay if i'm looking at four cars that are all going the same speed i'm gonna take i'm gonna like

take out the car

that one that has livery that is crazy um well uh the way george hotz calculates it is we're at

one intervention every 3 000 miles now and we're basically doubling that every year and so he

estimates that tesla will be truly full self-driving human level every 500 miles or 500

000 miles uh in eight years and he says that he's two years behind tesla so he will have a full

self-driving system and he's going to be able to drive a full self-driving system in eight years

and he's going to be able to drive a full self-driving system that is better than humans it's like

agi for driving uh in 10 years and the company's 10 years old so he says he's halfway there which

i thought was cool but it was interesting to hear his comments uh we should play some of these i'm

surprised this hasn't gotten clipped as much as it should have because uh there's some really spicy

hot takes find some clips clip cowboy clip cowboy um david sachs says if judged based on consumer

adoption ai chat bots are the most popular technology ever if i if judged based on poll

numbers they are the least popular how to explain this a big part of it is the doomer industrial

complex hundreds of astroturfed organizations that have spread doomer narratives about ai

writer nairit weiss blot has analyzed this ecosystem and traced its funding to just a few

effective altruism billionaires namely dustin moskowitz john tallon vitalik uh buterin john

tallon founded skype okay um he's estonian

collectively they have donated over a billion dollars to the cause of catastrophizing ai those

repeating the memes should understand the source yeah this is interesting i mean it does it it

begs a ton of interesting questions about like how intentional is this because when i see someone

take the ai safety question into the stratosphere and take me into terminator world i do my my

natural reaction is like oh like just let people build whatever they want but then i'm like no i

i i actually don't want infinite ai slop for children with adult content like i do want that

barrier and that's not d cell yeah or i wouldn't call it d cell but maybe it's slightly d cell i

don't know uh i think here's the odd here's the thing as ai starts getting better as agents start

getting better at longer and longer term tasks and can actually do things that like take you know

reasoning at multiple steps yeah yeah i think the terminator

scenarios where you could let an ai loose and it's just operating indefinitely against some

sort of objective start to start to be a little bit more for people for i would say like the

broader tech community to like wrap their head around but right now they're just so bad at

long-term tasks for the most part yeah except for like some instances of like engineering work yeah

there certainly is some some level of value of just of just being like

for an average person like think of the terminator instead of like well if you're in this chatbot and

you go down this thing they'll be talking about mirrors and there'll be a lot of m dashes and then

they might go a little bit crazy but you can't really tell and then they might be able to pull

out of it and they'll be fine later but then some people might go way too far and become like

one-shotted and it's this and this is it's this complex thing and they're like still pretty high

functional and they can still run a venture fund but they're like kind of weird on online and it's

like how do i process that as opposed to be like if we don't get this right it's terminator and

you're like okay yeah we got to get it right right as opposed to like the more nuanced thing um but

yes it is very interesting to understand like how the money is flowing and what the incentives are

because there are a ton of incentives and there's and there are all sorts of and there are all sorts

of little schemes that can go on to to uh to capture you know like regulatory capture stuff

and there's uh just hey i just want to make i just want to you know get paid to do this thing

or get paid to write sci-fi or whatever there's so many dc says there's not much positive media

about ai that's that's another thing i've been wondering the media obviously will use some of

the sources that have been funded by this group yeah but at the same time they were already pretty

well set up to talk about the potential downside scenarios of ai development yeah taylor in the

chat says dang they named their capital after the guy that built skype wait what is that the capital

estonia's talin oh it is that is crazy yon talon that's wild uh well we have our first in studio

guest of the day uh soren monroe anderson let me tell you about google ai studio create an ai

powered app faster than ever gemini understands the capabilities you need and automatically

wires up the right models and apis for you get started at ai.studio slash build so good to see

you good to see you congratulations uh give us the news what uh what happened today yeah so

today neros is announcing our 75 million dollar wow series b let's go do i ring the gong or do you

hit the gun please hit the gong for us thank you hit it so uh for those who have been uh living in

a foxhole yeah like whoa powerful power power very good yeah uh for those who have been living in a

foxhole uh what do you do how do you describe the business and the shape of the business right now

if you have any ideas what do you do what do you do what do you do um you know i think we've been

doing this for a long time um we've been doing this for a long time um we're very focused on

manufacturing we're very focused on manufacturing and we're very focused on building high-end

military drones we're very focused on manufacturing like we're producing the best of the best uh

low-cost drones uh primarily for the military so we say we are trying to build an asymmetric

advantage for the west what that means is our products have extremely high impact on the

battlefield but our low costs and are built with consumer technology um which allows us to produce a

large scale we're very focused on manufacturing as well um so that's kind of in a nutshell what we're doing but right now we're focused on fpv drones so first person view drones these are very precise manually piloted systems

Manually piloted. Yep. And it's the type of drone that's revolutionized the war in Ukraine. I think

FPVs and Starlink are like the two technologies that have allowed Ukraine to do as well as they

have and defend themselves. And so we saw that back in 2023 when we started the company and

both myself and Olaf come from a drone racing background. We were both professional drone

racing pilots and we saw this technology was actually like changing the nature of warfare.

And so that's what we got into this and realized that the whole supply chain is generally controlled

by China for this type of drone and just drones in general. So our biggest focus is on a China

free supply chain and manufacturing this stuff in America and in the West. What percentage of

drone FPV drones that are active in Ukraine are dependent on Starlink today?

Can you actually do Starlink to the drone? Because direct to cell is coming, but drones, it's kind of, it's not as big as a plane.

Because there's also the, what is the really light wires that you can-

Fiber optic. Fiber optic. Yeah.

I want to hear about that too.

So yeah, they're experimenting with tons of different types of comms. Starlink is used on

larger drones, not typically on FPV drones. It's a little bit higher.

There's like, yeah, a little bit of lag that would make it-

Yeah, latency and then just the size of the terminal.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It doesn't make it ideal for our use case where we're focused on very low latency comms and we

actually do custom communications links at Nero. So that's one of our focuses is that low latency

anti-jam characteristic. And that's also what fiber optic is used for because you can't jam-

Jam fiber. Yeah.

Yeah.

It feels like AI is so controversial, adult content getting one-shotted. How does it feel

working in an uncontroversial category now?

I mean, I don't-

I don't think-

Are you being sarcastic?

I'm being sarcastic. It does feel like a lot of the, is this bad energy has been absorbed? You're not going to crash the global economy. It feels like the vibes have definitely shifted. Give me the broader update on how you think that just military technology in general is being perceived by America or any constituents.

Yeah, I do think there's been a huge shift in the last couple of years.

Obviously people are starting to say, okay, well, Bill, you have this shit right?

Yeah.

It's just that America gave up so much of the military time they were giving up to fight Clinton.

That's right.

But different factors. The world's watching what's happening in Ukraine and thinking to themselves, well, if it can happen to them, it can happen to us.

And so it's no longer controversial to like think that you have to build systems that allow you to defend your territory.

And so that's what, like our primary goal is territorial defense of sovereign nations, and that should be a very uncontroversial thing to work on.

Now there's a lot of talent out there that just doesn't want to work on defense.

Yeah.

actual like kinetic systems um but we're we're you know very upfront about what we do we make

drones that explode um and so if people do want to work on that that then they tend to be very

very motivated because they see the impact that it's having do you like palmer's framing of like

america as not the world police but as the world's arms dealer this idea that america should be

turning all of our adversaries or all of our uh all of our allies into spiky porcupines i think

that's the phrase he uses do you like that yeah i think that's a great framing um i'd also say

there's a tremendous amount of development uh being done in other places right now where

america actually needs to like catch up yeah um so the other like large announcement that we have

today is that we were selected by the u.s army's uh purpose-built attributable system program

in uh normal speak it's basically the way that the army is going to buy our type of drone buy fpv

drones um so this is a really big deal because it shows that

the department of war and the army um are moving very quickly on actually like getting these uh

getting these drones deployed to to their forces and teaching people how to fly fpv and this is

currently like the the us is so far behind on this right now um but you have like the marine

corps we just announced a 17 million dollar purchase order with them uh the army selected

us for the pbass program you've got the uh drone dominance and and uh just all the the support from

people with with hegseth um the the department of war is very very serious about drones now

um which is incredible to see yeah I was always I was wondering about how you balance out that

framing of like we have to build for a ukrainian person a ukrainian soldier because the ukraine war

is not a place where we're sending hundreds of thousands of Americans boots on the ground like

that's not what the modern Battlefield looks like it looks much more like this arms dealer

citizenship that Palmer outlines um but at the same time there we do need to keep our own

armed forces equipped with the best technology we need them up to speed in case something does

happen and we do go boots on the ground uh how how do you think about like is it like a tech

transfer where you're using stuff you've learned in Ukraine and bringing that to the army and just

getting them up to speed or this Marine Corps like how do the two what is the flow between the r d

cycle that's happening abroad for another name

nation for an ally and then also something that's happening for American soldiers yeah that's a great

question it's all about the iteration loop that we can build yeah um and so this is why nearest

operates in Ukraine we have an office in Ukraine we have a team there and we've sent thousands of

systems to Ukraine and so what that allows allows us to do is work directly with the military units

there and understand how our systems are working and not working a lot of U.S companies unfortunately

uh deployed things into Ukraine

at the start of the full-scale invasion but then were turned off by the fact that their things

didn't work and people told them they didn't work and then they didn't go through the cycle of

improving them um and then you hear a lot of talk about sort of the regulatory hurdles and why it's

hard to work with Ukraine which it is there are plenty of hurdles but it's absolutely critical

that we're looking at uh you know the cutting edge the battlefield where this stuff is being proven

being developed um to to make it actually effective for our our soldiers um because I have a pretty

strong feeling that a lot of the technology that's being developed in America right now is going to

uh fall flat on its face when it actually sees prime time yeah Jordy our countries do countries

want a sovereign like drone manufacturing base are you exploring because like part of part of I

think Ukraine's success at least in in uh you know at least dragging this war into this like you know

space has been their own internal production capacity which I'm sure you guys I don't know

if you would classify it as like competing with but like certainly I'm sure like the systems are

both being used in the same um in the same fronts so I'm wondering in the same way that countries

are want like a sovereign AI strategy they want their own data centers if they also want to make

sure they have local drone capacity uh or if they're comfortable saying like we have our partner

for this and we just want to keep it that way it would be it would be a lot easier to you know to

we need to know that we can scale up the supply side

on whenever we want.

Yeah, countries absolutely do want their own drone

industrial base, their own domestic supply.

And this is something we recognize and we're working on.

So I think you've got to realize that the supply chain has

to be somewhat global to compete with China.

There's no one country that's even close.

And so if we're going to have a chance at this,

it's a collaborative effort.

The way Niros thinks about this is, at some point,

we're going to build a massive factory that's

capable of giant volumes.

But what's coming out of that factory

might be 70% components and drones

that are assembled in other places,

like these nodes that are in other countries.

We think it's really important to be a Western defense

company, not just an American defense company.

And that's, again, with our work in Ukraine,

we have a presence in London.

We are also, we're basically expanding globally earlier

than I could have guessed and earlier than most startups do,

because drones are a category that are inherently,

like countries want it close to their chest.

And they want to work with systems that are proven

and that are interoperable with their allied partners.

But they do need that industrial base domestically.

And so would you pursue like a GOKO model at some point,

where like a country would actually

like own the facility, and you guys would effectively

like provide the IP on that?

Is that a model that you guys are pursuing?

Yeah, that's definitely something

that we are looking into.

We are trying to figure out how to build out the most robust

supply chain, and then put our manufacturing into a,

not a literal box, but into a box,

and be able to teach kind of any group of folks

around the globe, like this is how you would

assemble archers.

And a lot of that also looks like building

really great testing, and just being

very confident in the components in the supply chain.

And so it's a very, very large effort to get there,

but we are going in that direction.

What's the progress on the capacity front?

I think when we had you on the show last, you were in the,

was it single?

Like you were doing, I want to say

it was something like 1,000 drones a month,

but you're ramping it up from there.

How's the pacing?

Yeah.

So right now, we're currently actually producing

about 2,500 archers per month.

That's mostly driven by demand.

So we're ready to scale well beyond that.

And we've been on a pretty steady ramp

since that 1,000 number earlier this year.

And we're leaning very forward on our capacity and our supply

chain, because we do expect that the tens of thousands

a month demand is going to be there next year.

And Ukraine's using something?

Using something like 5 million drones a year or something?

That's right.

So I mean, you're at like 1%.

But obviously, that's incredible,

considering that you started the company just a few years ago.

As far as we know, Nearest is the highest rate drone producer

in America.

No one has proved us wrong on that yet.

I'm sure they'll reach out if they do.

So what are the, you mentioned, pathways in the military

now that you can become an FPV pilot.

Is that going to be a track now in the very, very future?

Yeah, so we're going to be going to the various groups,

whether it's Army, Navy, et cetera,

where people will go in and choose,

like I want to be an FPV pilot.

It's not set in stone yet, but there's various different paths.

So Nearest does training courses.

We offer this as a service to our customers.

But there are also efforts, like you

can look at the Marine Corps attack drone team.

They've done a fantastic job just leaning forward

and sort of, like from the bottoms up, figuring out,

like, what are we going to do about this?

What are we going to do about this?

And then they're going to be doing a lot of training

with the military, and training a group of experts.

And then they're passing that across the whole Marine Corps.

So you see that a lot in the FPV world,

where guys are actually into it as hobbyists.

And then they see what's happening in Ukraine.

They're like, wow, we actually need to figure this out

for our own unit.

And so it just kind of happens organically.

And then now, with all the top level support as well,

those two things are kind of meeting in the middle.

Take me through a little bit of the supply chain. Obviously, with the iPhone, completely made in China,

there's a push to make an iPhone in America.

But everyone knows that it's going to be Vietnam, India,

South Korea, Taiwan, a bunch of other things in the interim.

You mentioned wanting to be a Western defense company.

Where are you seeing pockets of just excitement

on the industrial side within the American allies world?

Like, where are you finding, oh, we can find motors in Canada

or Taiwan's coming online for something or else.

Like, where's interesting in the supply chain globally?

People are really starting to pay attention to the critical minerals,

which is super, super important for things like motors and batteries.

So there was a deal that I think was announced last week,

a $1.5 billion deal with Vulcan Elements in the Department of War.

There is similar efforts with MP Materials domestically.

And we do see smaller kind of startups going after the actual motor assembly side.

So that one, I think, has been, I think, one of the things that we've seen in the last couple of years.

I think it's been pretty clearly highlighted and people are working on it.

It goes beyond Nearest, beyond the drone industry.

It's just like a industrial-based wide problem when you get to the material level.

Those are redwood materials, which is just recycling.

I imagine if you're on a battlefield and you're blowing up a bunch of drones

and you can go and get the magnets back,

like that's a pretty easy thing to recycle, I would imagine.

Although it's probably hard to get it out of the battlefield.

Yeah, getting out of the battlefield would be very difficult.

But think about all the washing machines,

like, you know, old washing machines, there's so much neodymium there.

I don't know how big the supply is.

I didn't realize that's so much in there.

I mean, just think like anything that has an electric motor that's here domestically,

that is stuff that can be recycled.

So there is a little bit more, like, there are things that give me hope,

but there's plenty of things that scare me.

Nearest, we spend a lot of our time going down to the chip level,

because one of the things we see pretty frequently in the drone industry

is folks saying that they're, you know, NDA compliant, basically,

not Chinese.

They just mean the component is assembled outside of China,

but it's still using Chinese microchips.

And to us, that's kind of useless.

So we spend a lot of our time working with the actual chip vendors,

like the chip manufacturers, because you have to ensure,

like, the wafer's not made in China, it's not packaged in China,

it never goes through there from the supply chain.

And that's, like, not something that's required by the regulations yet.

So we're trying to get ahead of that, and we're going very, very deep.

But the problems scare me.

It's all across the entire supply chain.

Are there any places where it is fine to buy from China?

I'm just imagining, like, raw aluminum, like, that's not in short supply,

it's just something that you kind of need,

and you can't really put a microchip in there, or a microphone,

or do some sort of remote takeover.

Like, it is what it is, just buy it from wherever.

Yeah, I think there's an 80-20 rule.

I don't think that our progress on, for example,

like, our progress fielding FPV systems

to U.S. forces should not be stopped by a requirement

that everything has to be completely China-free right now,

because it wouldn't be possible.

And so what you want to think about is preparing for the instance

where that is completely cut off,

and what would be items that are quick to replace.

And, you know, we, like, when we do our efforts

to get rid of China in our bomb,

it's basically looking at the things that are most critical first

and putting our engineering, like, limited energy

and engineering resources towards those.

And then the things that are, you know, would be less catastrophic,

those are lower down in the priority.

That's Bill of Materials, not B-O-M-B, right?

Sorry, yes, Bill of Materials.

It's easy to confuse when you're talking about NIROS.

It is, it is.

I was confused.

Well, I wasn't confused.

I just assumed you were talking about an actual...

Take me on a tour of what,

I don't know how much you can share about this,

but what are people excited about on the drone counter UAS side?

Because we've seen Anvil.

We've seen then electronic takeover.

Then there's the fiber optics thing that we've seen.

There's been a whole bunch of,

it feels like a game of, like, rock, paper, scissors on the battlefield.

Is it just rock, paper, scissors, or is it more like chess?

Is it a 12P chess?

I saw a video of throwing up nets over roadways.

Nets.

I've seen eagles come in and birds.

Like, what's actually getting used?

I imagine that the birds didn't make it out into the field,

but did they?

I don't know.

There is kind of everything because it has to be layered.

So you have your EW systems.

Those are kind of your primary line of defense.

They're sort of passive?

FPVs.

I mean, they're passive.

Well, you're activating them because you also need your own drones

to be able to get through, right?

So this is one of the things that's actually very tricky in Ukraine

is coordinating the, like, friendly electronic warfare

with the friendly drones so that you can pass over that sort of line

on the front

and get over into enemy territory.

Interesting.

So there actually needs to be a pretty close tie

between the electronic warfare operators and the drone operators.

You also have sort of the last-ditch efforts,

and this is things like nets and shotguns.

And I'd say sort of an in-between of that is something like

what Alan Control Systems is building, right,

where you have an automated gun turret.

It is just smacking drones out of the sky.

But personally, I want to try to take that drone out, you know,

well before it gets within, you know,

before it gets within hundreds of meters of where I'm at.

So that's where longer-range electronic warfare,

things like that are going to help.

But is there any, is there,

what's the path to having, like, an FPV drone that's flying

using computer vision to identify another maybe enemy drone

and then having some type of, like, locking system

where you're using a friendly drone to take out another drone in the sky?

It's already happening.

Yeah.

Drone-on-drone warfare is a very real thing now.

So interceptors have become one of the sort of latest big developments

coming out of Ukraine.

So they're intercepting everything from, you know, small FPVs, Mavics,

larger reconnaissance drones, and then Shawhead-type drones.

And so you need different types of interceptors for each of those.

But we are starting to get to that point that a lot of people have imagined

where it's, you know, the front line is like drones versus drones.

And a lot of the time,

you're not even making it to a kind of typical military target

because there's just so much drone activity happening.

Take me through the biggest or the most exquisite drone

that we might see on the battlefield versus, like, the least exquisite.

So I imagine that there's no drones that cost $1 that is just too cheap,

and there's no drones that cost a billion dollars.

But are we in the there's a $1,000 drone, there's a million-dollar drone?

Like, how wide is the gap of, like, if you just look at the whole battlefield,

what's the gap between, like, the scale of, like, the biggest, most insane drone

to, like, the smallest, most attributable?

Yeah, drone means so many different things.

It's really confusing for people.

Sure. Isn't F-35 a drone?

Like, it might be in a certain context.

So I'd say, like, the lowest end is kind of your, like, FPV system.

That's, you know, if you're, like, getting that in Ukraine,

it could be $200, $300, primarily built from Chinese components,

but, you know, very inexpensive.

Almost like consumer-level hardware, right?

It is.

It is consumer-level hardware.

I mean, it's been modified to perform better.

And then they, like, tape a grenade on it.

Yeah, exactly.

Does Russia ever call China and say,

why are you guys supplying a component tree that gets into the, like, hands of our enemy?

Or is it just kind of, like, if I'm Putin, I'm calling up Xi,

and I'm saying, hey, our number one problem right now is basically you.

Yeah.

I would say China has benefited by far, like, absolutely the most from...

Selling to both sides.

...the nation of Ukraine.

They are deliberately selling to both sides in millions of units.

I mean, it is, you know, billions, tens of billions of dollars being generated

for the economy in China based on the war in Ukraine.

And you can even see, like, Ukrainian entrepreneurs will talk about this

where they go to Shenzhen and they're negotiating deals

to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of components.

And technically, it's...

It's banned in China, but everyone's benefiting.

So why would they stop it?

Okay.

Take me up the stack.

So you have a $200 drone, Chinese components off the shelf.

What's the most exquisite drone that...

Wait, wait.

Before we get higher, there was a YC company that got announced last week

using drones to take out mosquitoes.

Oh, yeah.

A lot of people were saying...

It's for assassinations.

That's what they were saying.

Well, yeah, but they were saying, like, this is impossible.

Oh.

Is it possible?

I have no idea.

It's hard to say.

I probably wouldn't use drones for taking out mosquitoes,

but best of luck to them.

Apparently, the founder is just, like, obsessed.

Everyone was like, oh, he's doing this for defense tech.

And it's like, no, actually, this founder just hates mosquitoes.

And he's, like, obsessed.

He's been on a lifelong quest to, like, kill the mosquito,

which is hilarious.

I do.

I align with that.

I grew up in Alaska, and there's a horrible amount of mosquitoes.

So if it works, I'm going to be pumped.

You grew up in Alaska?

What's with all these Alaskan kids around?

Did you grow up near Ty Morse?

We grew up in Anchorage, yeah.

Together?

No.

You didn't know each other growing up?

OK, you didn't know each other.

This was a crazy connection.

That is a crazy connection, because I

feel like there's a lot of shared . . .

In a town of 200 people, you guys didn't know each other?

Basically.

Basically.

What's the actual population?

It's not that small in there.

It's, like, 350,000 in Anchorage.

Yeah, it's not that small.

That's pretty big, yeah.

Yeah, that is crazy.

And I don't know how we . . . you know, now we've connected,

and, like, I crash at my apartment when he's in town.

That's awesome, yeah.

So good Alaska connection.

He's been on a great run.

That video that you put out, or that he did,

with, like, checking in on the Gundo, the whole, like,

roundtable was awesome, because I feel like two years ago

or something we met, and the total amount raised across

the entire Gundo crew was, like, $5 million,

and now it's, like, close to half a billion.

Yeah, that's wild to think about.

In one of the group chats earlier this morning,

Isaiah posted his raise, and then we posted our raise,

and someone else was like,

another quarter billion to the fellas.

It's insane.

It's ridiculous.

It's good.

It's exactly what should happen.

Like, when the reason . . . I mean, the Gundo was, like,

this meme, it was this moment, it was this, like,

oh, like, there's this cool movement happening.

But, like, fundamentally, it was like, okay,

this is actually what works, and this is where the capital

should be going.

It should not be going to the scams and the frauds

and all the other junk that's going on.

Yeah, the critique was a lot of these companies

aren't going to work.

You can apply that critique to any sector or region

that gets venture capital dollars.

Anyway, so we're moving up . . .

The critique was kind of valid, right?

Because there was a lot of, like, we were talking about

crazy ambitious things that were, you know,

and also in a kind of silly manner . . .

Sure.

. . . which attracted a lot of attention.

And I think there's reason to critique that,

but now you see that, like, the El Segundo companies

are truly executing.

Yeah.

And that's where the difference is.

Like, we went heads down for a year and a half,

two years, and now the results are starting . . .

It was very clearly in that group chat,

like, a somewhat of a moratorium.

A somewhat of a moratorium on posting at some point.

Yes.

Because . . .

Which I love.

You know, guys, we've got to get off the timeline.

But it worked.

It worked, and it was great because . . .

You've got to lock in.

There was a world where it was like,

okay, everyone in El Segundo winds up becoming a podcaster.

And, like, it's like, okay, well,

there's actually nothing getting built.

Like, you guys really did get, like, lost in the sauce,

but that never happened.

It was just like, oh, wow, another puff piece

from the legacy media.

And they just . . .

And it was great because that's super high leverage

because you just, like, show up, you get the thing,

and then you move on and get back.

You move up the stack.

Move up the stack for us.

Yeah, so on the other end of the range of drone,

that . . . I would call that, like,

the CCA, Collaborative Combat Aircraft,

you know, that Anduril's working on,

as well as other startups and primes.

That's . . . I mean, it's an autonomous fighter jet.

It's hard to get more exquisite than that in the drone world.

So Anduril just flew theirs yesterday, the YFQ-44A,

and then General Atomic has a similar program in the CCA.

Those aren't . . .

Those aren't live in Ukraine yet, right?

No, definitely not.

Okay, so then there must be something that's, like,

the next best that's out there.

Is that right?

Well, there's tons of . . .

There's too many categories of name in drones.

So, like, you go up the stack from FPV to a fixed wing

that'll go, like, 50, 100 kilometers.

Then you're also looking at a bunch of reconnaissance drones.

You have things like DJI Mavix, like, you know, small, cheap,

but also up to really expensive fixed wings.

And those are kind of all, like,

deployable by one or two people.

And then you get into the really big stuff,

and that's your, like, Reapers and kind of in between that

is the, like, Shield VBAT.

And so, you know, you can look at all . . .

There's a group one through five classification for drones.

And within those, there's tons of different categories.

And are you firmly in one group and you plan to stay there?

Do you want to be in all five groups?

Is that even, like, the right way to think about growing your business?

Or are there other business lines that you could expand into

that doesn't just mean total dominance

of the groups?

Yeah.

So true success for Neuros means making the West drone industrial base

competitive with China.

Yeah.

So there's a lot to do in that, right?

Yeah.

We're not going to just be doing FPV drones in the future.

Sure.

But we do know that, like,

focus is probably the most important thing for a startup.

Yeah.

And the market for FPV drones is massive and only growing.

And they are, like,

I believe they are the most important type of drone

to be working on right now.

And until America can produce them in the millions,

we are pretty focused on that.

Yeah.

Makes sense.

What is the state of drone racing today?

Is it growing in popularity?

Or is it staying niche?

Yeah.

Are you guys hiring out of it?

We are definitely hiring out of it.

We have lots of drone racers on the Neuros team.

Yeah.

It's been a great talent pool.

I do think that, unfortunately,

it has sort of fallen off in popularity from its peak.

Really?

But I do think it's going to come back,

especially with all of the relevance to military.

We're starting to even see military drone racing leagues coming up.

And that's where, like,

I think that is going to become the pipeline

for drone racing talent in the future.

The new, like, sport shooting where on a base it's, like,

who's the fastest, most accurate pilot versus...

Oh, yeah, drone on drone would be fun.

The other thing that would be interesting,

I don't know if anyone's doing this,

but autonomous drone racing league,

that feels, like, pretty valuable

to build out that skill set.

Can you as a team build a software stack

that gets you through all of the different obstacles

while you're being jammed

or while there's flashing lights going on and off

and adding some sort of variability?

Yeah, I think you would have to add a lot of variability

because the hardest thing about autonomy

is not making a drone go to a known point

or making many drones go to a known point.

Sure.

It's operating when you don't have GPS,

when it's dark out,

when there's bad weather,

when your comms denied.

Like, that's why autonomy is...

I think it's behind where most people think.

Totally.

Like, most drones in Ukraine are not autonomous at all.

Yeah.

And so...

But that's true of self-driving cars in America.

Yeah.

Like, there's a lot of tele-op going on.

There's a lot of stuff like that.

And, yeah, we're just still years away

from it actually being.

Exactly.

And we're huge believers in autonomy.

Of course.

We're scaling our autonomy program,

and it's going to make drones

just so much more effective for soldiers.

But there's been AI drone racing leagues

for a long time.

Oh, really?

And, like, the University of Zurich

has been working on this for many years,

and they have a drone that's beaten, like,

professional pilots around a closed course.

Okay.

But it only works in a closed course,

and often they have, you know,

hundreds of camera angles,

and they're, like, tracking the position of the drone...

Oh, yeah, no.

...from outside the drone.

And so it's just like,

that doesn't actually apply to the real world.

That doesn't count.

Exactly.

Yeah, you need to narrow it down,

and imagine that...

I have this joke,

this is, like, joke of a test for AGI,

which is, like,

I want the humanoid robot

to get into a manual sports car

and do the Nurburgring in seven minutes,

like, shifting gears...

Yeah.

...with the G-forces.

Like, that is extremely difficult,

and we are clearly decades away from that.

And I think the same thing is probably true

for actual drone racing,

like, how long it takes

if you don't have all of the extra

of perfect information.

Like, you actually try and simulate

what it's like for the human.

Well, I think the lap record on the Nurburgring

for a manual sports car is...

I think it's right above seven minutes.

Yeah.

So they'd have to be doing really well.

Got to get them...

Well, a robot can take it to the edge, right?

Like, you could...

A robot could crash, like, 20 times

in order to actually...

That's true.

...get the lap time.

So potentially, you could be like,

well, on this corner,

we can hit it at 180,

even though, like, there's a...

Maybe push it further.

51% chance we'll go into the barrier.

Can we do the next episode

from the Nurburgring,

from the passenger seat?

For sure. That'd be amazing.

From the passenger seat.

I'd love that.

Up the stakes.

Have you gotten into racing?

I know some of the GUNDO guys love racing.

Yeah, I mean, I've loved racing sports

from, you know, a young age

and, you know, was focused on drone racing

for about 10 years,

but I'm also a huge car guy,

and so I follow a lot of it.

That's cool.

We're going to do a TBPN track day.

That would be incredible.

You will get the invite.

Yeah.

What's the team size like?

How big is the company?

So we're about 80 people now,

and we're hiring as fast as we can.

And are you going to stay in El Segundo?

Do you have to graduate and leave?

They're already global.

He's already an international businessman.

Yeah, but, I mean, in terms of HQ,

it feels like El Segundo is, like,

this amazing, like, proving ground

for all these companies,

but at a certain point,

if you want 20,000 square feet,

200,000 square feet,

it just makes sense to, like,

even just go, like, one...

Yeah.

You know, one city over,

but what's that like?

We're expanding,

and we're trying to stay in El Segundo.

Cool.

There are big buildings.

Yeah, ABL is there, right?

It's...

Yeah, I mean,

you have to kind of be intentional about it,

and it's not an easy real estate market

by any means,

but we're trying very hard

because I think the city's done a lot for us,

and we want to stay there.

And, yeah, we're growing a ton

in the headquarters in Los Angeles

as well as our other global locations.

So really, I would say

the biggest limiting factor to our execution

is just the number of great people

we can get on board.

Mm-hmm.

Is there going to be, like,

a separation on, like,

where the factory is at some point?

Like, you'd set up a factory

in, like, a Midwestern city

or something like that at some point?

Yeah, that's very likely.

At some point, it doesn't make sense

to do the scale that we're talking about

in California,

but you have access

to the best engineering talent here.

Sure, so for design stuff,

it makes sense.

Design, and then you still need

a lot of people

and a lot of those engineers

to be willing to also go out

to, you know, the factory

wherever it is,

because it is critical

to have your engineering talent

right next to your production.

Yeah.

What about automation

on the production line?

Like, get me up to speed

on how relevant that is

versus you're trying to iterate,

and at a certain point,

you might learn something

from the battlefield

and need to change the entire design,

so you don't want

to bake everything in, right?

Yeah.

Automate is the last step

in the formula.

Okay.

And so,

you can even look at,

like, the iPhone production.

Yeah.

Where, you know,

they make a new version

every year,

and a lot of that

is hand assembly

done with, like,

simple tooling.

Yeah.

Tooling's really important,

and being smart

about your workstations

and your work instructions,

and, you know,

you want to be making it

as easy as possible

for the human operator,

but a lot of the time,

it does not make sense

to automate.

So is the DJI blackout factory

fake news?

I think it's real.

You think it's real?

Yeah.

And it's hard to say

because the last time

they let a camera

into a DJI factory

was, like, five years ago,

but I think that should tell you

something about

what they're working on.

Interesting.

Well, they could be faking it, right?

Because they could be like,

yeah, because if the iPhone,

I think the iPhone pulls in,

like, two million

It's just a bunch of workers

in there

with night vision goggles.

It's a really blackout factory.

Yeah.

Yeah, we turn the lights off,

like, we got you owned.

Like, tried this, Americans.

You guys suck.

And it's just, like,

working with night vision.

I don't know.

But you,

you think they're pretty advanced.

But at some point,

it doesn't,

you know, like,

you don't think it breaks

the laws of physics or something.

Well, it doesn't necessarily matter

if they're able to produce

at scale, at cost,

like, which they're already doing.

So whether they're doing it

all with robots

or all with people,

they're already able to do it.

So it doesn't,

it doesn't really matter.

We need to figure out

how we can do it in America.

Totally, totally.

Yeah, that makes sense.

It's funny.

Great stuff.

Well, thank you for the update.

Yeah.

Thanks for doing this work.

And congratulations.

Congratulations on the round.

Thank you, guys.

Great to see you.

We will,

we'll see you at the track.

Awesome.

Track soon.

We'll talk to you soon.

Thank you so much.

Let me tell you about Profound.

Get your brand mentioned in ChatGPT.

Reach millions of consumers

who are using AI

to discover new products and brands.

Our next guest is already here

in the TBP at Ultradome.

Looking fantastic.

Whoa.

What an outfit.

You're going to have

to break that down for us.

Thank you so much.

We have Jeff from Anduril.

Great to see you.

Yeah, you too, brother.

Thank you.

Please.

Every guy should have

like 20 or 30 jackets like this.

How does it do?

It's 1992.

Build it up over time.

It's great for eBay.

Did not smell great

when I first got it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's the problem.

Appreciate it.

That's the problem.

Great to have you here.

Great to be here.

For those who aren't familiar,

please introduce yourself.

My name is Jeff Miller.

I'm the VP of Marketing at Anduril.

How'd you wind up there?

Long, windy story.

So I was starting out in advertising.

I was inspired by

those old Spike Lee commercials.

It's gotta be the shoes.

I always knew I wanted to work

in advertising and marketing.

Worked at Ogilvy,

then went to PepsiCo

where you build great classic brand marketing principles.

And then I decided I wanted to go

and do something that felt much harder,

much more foreign to me.

So I went to LA,

spent six years here working at Snap

and had an incredible experience there

building pre-IPO as they went public and beyond.

And I had a global team at one point,

but the way I describe it there

was like great formative experience,

but it feels like

it felt a lot like eating potato chips.

It was really fun,

but it tasted good in the second,

but didn't leave any sort of meaningful impact on me

beyond just the moment.

And so I was looking for something more impactful

and that's what drew me to Anduril.

How do you think about

who you're targeting with Anduril marketing?

Because it feels like

I've never bought an Anduril product.

I love the brand.

Is that relevant?

But in an alternate timeline,

you would have worked at the company.

Yeah, so is it recruiting focused

or are you actually trying to do brand marketing

that will hit with like the buyer in DC?

Do you think about it that way?

Are you at all quantitative

or is it just a way higher level?

The way we think about it is that

we of course are thinking about the operators

that are going to use our actual products

and thinking about the Pentagon,

people are going to buy it.

But ultimately,

we're also thinking about our employee base,

our future employees.

So how do we be thinking about brand as a talent magnet?

But even broader than that,

we think about Americans,

Americans at large.

For us, we believe defense deserves really strong brands.

The war fighters deserve strong brands.

And I think if you look at the current administration,

what they're doing with the Department of War

and their storytelling,

or even let's give an announcement to the Marines,

the 250th anniversary today of the Marines.

And you look at the content they put out over the weekend,

it just makes you want to enlist.

And for us,

it's been a historically opaque industry

that has really lived in the value

of not telling clear stories.

And we see the complete opposite.

We think that this story deserves to be told

for our war fighters,

for the American taxpayer to understand what we do

and why it's so important.

What was the historical marketing strategy of the Primes?

Did they do...

How did they even think about their marketing?

Because obviously you came in and you're like,

hey, let's reinvent marketing in this category.

They are iconic brands.

There's just no denying that every...

If you just walked down the street...

The question that I have is,

I think they're iconic

because when you look at some of the products

that they've made,

specifically like fighter aircraft,

certain firearms, et cetera,

they are iconic products that make you...

People post the B-21 Raider as a meme.

You know that you're onto something

if your product is being turned into a meme.

But I just wonder if there was any history

of them doing, saying,

hey, let's do an out-of-home campaign.

Yeah.

Well, what I think you're hitting on

is a really important point.

When we talk about brand here,

it starts with the product itself.

Product is brand, I think, in our category

as much as any.

Because it has this great ability

to speak to national security

in a way that will rally the country

to really think about what's great about America,

about advanced manufacturing, about innovation,

about what Americans hard at work can achieve.

So if you look back at the 50s, 60s, 70s,

there's incredible advertising

that you would see from Lockheed

and from the other primes.

And that's something that...

And were these like Porsche-style ads

where it's like a lot of text

and just like a picture of it?

And it's like, you know,

the F-16 is not just a fighter jet.

You know what's so great?

So I worked at a company named Ogilvy Mather,

and David Ogilvy is famous

for starting that style of advertising.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The long lead copy.

And I think why that resonates so well

in the context of Porsche

is because ultimately it's just a really great story

about a product that isn't for everyone,

but resonates with a specific set of people.

And in a lot of ways,

those are the principles we use today.

Yeah.

Walk through like how you actually think

about a whole campaign.

I feel like Anduril launches a lot of products,

and there's a lot of different tools in the tool chest.

Like I'm thinking about the Eagle Eye launch.

There was obviously a video.

There was also like a Joe Rogan appearance,

which is like,

is that all in one project brief or deck?

Or how do you think about all the different touch points?

Because there's so many with something like Anduril

where product marketing for a new launch

might be a dinner in DC,

or it might be a Joe Rogan appearance.

There's so much that you can do that's not just like,

okay, make sure the Facebook ads are turned on.

Well, what I think you're seeing

rather than something like Facebook ads

is we're really speaking to capabilities

versus selling ads in the way that we think about it.

And I want to give a real credit to the team

behind here.

So Shannon Pryor, our VP of communications,

Jen Bucci, our VP of design,

Andrew Lee, who's our director of product marketing.

All of these people together are working closely

with our division,

with our business line,

with our founders

on how do we tell one cohesive story?

And I think what's important here,

it's not a template that we use.

Depending what that product launch is,

depending on the message that we're trying to communicate,

depending on who the core customer is,

all of those influence the approach that we take.

So those elements that you spoke about for Eagle Eye,

all of those were worked in person.

So we had a really close coordination.

What was true,

and I think is always true of the products that we launch,

is it's always first and foremost

about demonstrating real capabilities.

And we have a rule, this comes straight from Palmer,

the no render rule.

And what that means is that

we're never going to fake our capabilities.

We're going to always demonstrate the work that we do

in a way that's reflective

of the actual capabilities themselves.

So what you see on screen here

is a real capability of Eagle Eye.

It's mission planning.

We had another vignette that spoke to

our heightened survivability,

lethal capabilities.

And what I give a lot of credit to our design team

is the way they thought about this was

actually showing the real first person perspective

that is a true capability of the product.

And then our social team,

what we were really clear on is

you've got to drop people straight into the action.

The way that you're going to get them to buy in

is actually showing it

and not doing a lot of buildup

before you get to the capability.

You did an out of home campaign

for don't work at Andoril.

Are you doing an out of home campaign for Eagle Eye?

Is that relevant?

How do you decide where to do what?

So I personally am the biggest fan of out of home.

And I think there's reasons that I love it

that translate to things like NASCAR.

It's an undervalued asset

when you think about it in the context of a marketer.

If you really understand how to use a canvas

in an intentional way,

you can really stand out.

So when we think about outdoor,

we're thinking about

how it's going to show up on social as well.

You guys do an amazing job of that

as you think about the clips on the show.

For us, every time we're talking in outdoor,

we have one simple rule, say less.

And that it's like you have to have,

it's another old Ogilvy rule.

He says seven words less.

I like to say five words or less on it.

So for Eagle Eye,

we had a very simple line,

superpowers for superheroes.

And we demonstrate the capabilities.

Or when we showcase Fury,

which you guys were talking about with Sorin,

we say fight unfair.

And so you have these lines

that have a really clear perspective

that should make people immediately think

about what you're saying.

Whether they understand it in the moment or not,

it should stick with them.

Yeah.

And I think it just,

we've seen,

we review out of home campaigns

all the time on the show

because we see them hit the timeline.

We talk about them.

We love advertising.

We love advertising.

More than anyone else.

Genuinely.

I'd like to,

maybe you like advertising as much as us,

but there's not many.

You're in the conversation.

I appreciate it.

But it is hard when,

if you're a new startup

and you're selling a piece of software

that isn't highly visual

and people aren't familiar with your brand,

just like,

as much as you might want to be,

ah, I'm David Ogilvie.

I got this good tagline.

It's just not going to break through

as opposed to,

okay,

if you show me a picture of a plane,

even if it's a little bit,

even if it looks different

and the landing gear's a little bit different,

I'm going to know that's a drone.

That's a plane.

That's a piece of military technology.

There's all these cues that you can lean into.

Also,

Anduril's so big now.

Like,

just Anduril.

You must driving,

driving on the 101 into SF.

Yeah.

The disparity in quality of the outdoor.

Tell us about this.

Tell us,

tell us the story.

Tell us the story.

All right.

So Trey tweets at me at like,

on Monday at 736 AM.

He's,

he's going to the office of Founders Fund

and he's looking at his 37th terrible enterprise SaaS ad

on the,

on the 101.

And he says,

can we please just put a fury on a billboard

on the 101?

So I have to stop looking at these ads.

And he tags at me directly.

And I,

I take this as a personal challenge.

So when I worked at Gator,

we talked about movies.

We talked about being at the speed of sport.

Sure.

So for me at this point,

it was the challenge is on.

We have to have something live the very next day.

Yeah.

So by the next day we had an ad on the 101

and I tweeted,

I didn't even tell him I was doing this,

like right back at him

and credit to our team again,

moving quickly.

Wow.

It was a giant fury that said,

it said AI for fighter jets,

not enterprise SaaS.

Oh,

there you go.

That's amazing.

Last time,

last time I actually wasn't last trip,

but a few trips ago to SF,

I saw a billboard.

I was so confused by it

that I went,

I went to the website because I was like,

who is,

who is running out of home in such a confusing way.

I land on the website,

still don't know what the product is.

What are they doing?

So I think that just that,

that clarity without a home is so important where I not only saw the ad,

I went,

I did what they wanted.

I imagined go to the website and I'm still come away from it being like,

what,

what does this company do?

They have enough money to,

to buy billboards.

But yeah,

I still,

I mean,

I still,

we,

we are part of the Beaver.

We get to be in the,

and we've been in the company for about 10 years now.

We've got over 100,000,

but we still,

we've got to bring it all into the business.

So I think that's more of the focus of this world.

So that's one of the things that,

you know,

I think when you're looking at advertising,

if you're ever out there,

I think that out of home is the most undervalued form of advertising

and you hid one of the keywords on the head.

We don't look at marketing as superficial or fluff marking for us,

brings clarity.

And when you apply clarity with,

with context,

that's when out of home can be greater,

really any medium,

but a couple of examples I love are in Dayton airport.

If you fly into there,

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So where we have our customer for what you referenced earlier,

YFQ-44A, is right there outside of Dayton. And for those of you that know the history of Ohio,

Dayton was also the cradle, the birthplace of aviation, where the Wright brothers were

working on their original Wright Flyer. In fact, if you're in that airport, you will see a replica

of the Wright Flyer hanging from the ceiling. Right behind that, you will see a full-scale

Fury, where it simply says actual size. And so that context, that ad would only work in the

context of that airport. You put that in any other airport in America, it becomes less relevant.

So whether it's on the 101 or whether it's in Dayton Airport, we're always thinking about the

media placement as much as the message. And you had, Coogan, asked about the Don't Work campaign.

That's the one time we intentionally leaned into confusion. So our campaign there, the brief to

Jen and her team was simple. I won an ad campaign. It reminds me of that campaign, if you remember,

from Netflix. Netflix is a joke, where when you first see it, you're not sure if it's

funny or funny. You're not sure if it's funny or funny. You're not sure if it's funny or funny.

So the creative that came back, which was beautiful and just really thoughtful,

was that we would do a corporate campaign that says work at Andral. And then, of course,

was graffitied, was tagged, and everything that was graffitied was saying don't work there.

And I give our team a lot of credit. We'd already bought both URLs. So whether you go to

work at Andral.com or don't work at Andral.com, you're still going to land where we want you to

land. But it just became provocative in a way that whether you're Boston, Seattle, or Atlanta,

the three markets,

we were really focused on with our people team to recruit, you were going to see our message,

and you couldn't miss it. It was undeniable. What did some of your early mood boards look

like for Andral? I feel like Andral had effectively first mover advantage in marketing

in this new category of new players in defense. And when I think about the visuals surrounding

Andral, I think this is what a modern defense tech company should look like.

Maybe that's because I grew up playing Call of Duty, and Andral looks like a lot of the visuals,

and even the UI and stuff feels like it just fits into those worlds. And I know a lot of,

I'm sure a lot of our armed forces feel the same way. But what was like when you were mood boarding?

I don't know if that was a process that you went through with Jen or other people on the team

early on. What kind of inspiration were you pulling in? Well, you hit there on a few words

that are really important for us.

When we think about building this brand, we think about building it in a way that is open,

that is modern, that is honest. And we do it in a way that we're really conscious that we're

building it for the generation that ultimately is going to be responsible for building national

security of the present and the future. So the ability to speak in a language, whether that's

our voice, which I'm responsible and our team is responsible for, or our identity that Jen and

her team are responsible for, we're always thinking about the way that we can land something that feels

unique. And so full credit in terms of the identity work goes to Jen and her team and

Palmer and how they're building. And this extends from everything from the product identity to our

industrial design, environmental, to how we think about the brand identity. And then what I think

our team does really well is really establish a clear voice that whether it's on the identity or

the voice, we talk about it as brutalist, meaning we're not speaking in opaque terms that is

typical of the category. We're talking in really, really simple language that a 14-year-old person

can understand. If a 14-year-old can't see that and say, I get it, then we've missed the mark.

No render policy, only anime policy. There's a lot of anime. When do you pull anime off the

shelf? Is there going to be an anime video for Eagle Eye? Yes or no? And why or why not?

Sure. So we talk a lot about this as the Android Cinematic Universe is the

Yes.

way we like to describe it internally. And obviously, it's born out of Palmer's passion

for anime early on. But it's something that I'm so proud of in the context of what our team has

built. Because all of it, it's not using AI. It's all done through digital handbrush. And it's a

really powerful tool for us because now we've created an aesthetic around it that's specific

to us. And it makes it clear that you can look at one frame and you're not confused. So you can go

into the future and you can actually tell the story of what anime is.

Yeah, that's absolutely right.

So, you're gonna have a video of what a panderell might be doing in 10 years and you're never confusing and you don't even get in the comments and debates. Oh, that's CGI. It's like, of course, it came from a computer.

Yeah. And we, I won't name the company, but Jon and I were having this debate over a defense tech, hard tech company that we were, there was a three minute video and we were just going frame by frame. And I was convinced that it was like CGI or like AI generated. Jon was like, ah, like I kind of want to believe that it's real.

It was both.

It was a mix.

They were cutting out a lot of the...

That was a lot of the stuff.

That was a lot of the stuff.

between so bad so so they actually had a thing that would take off and fly this is a company

this is a company that's this is a company that's that's public right so they're putting this out

name names it can yeah yeah it can do vertical takeoff but not move or something like that it

was weird it was bizarre but yeah so so so for eagle eye like when when would you use that and

why and and well i think you're speaking to what's important when we make these choices it's a

creative choice sure sure sure and we're thinking about it in the context of where is a really great

room for lore and story building yeah so what i'll tell you is with with eagle eye we had great

ability by showing the first person perspective we thought that was the the most impactful way in

uh but what i will confirm is that there will be a chapter three to the animatic uh the andrew

cinematic universe so just be ready it's coming in 2026 that's exciting that's exciting uh talk

about sports marketing uh is that also underrated like uh out of home uh what's your been your

strategy for the future of sports marketing uh what's your strategy for the future of sports

marketing uh what's your strategy did you dip your toe in with small tests now you're doing

something big with nascar walk me through the thesis that's exactly right so we dipped our

toes with the the chargers who are a partner of ours they actually shared property with us their

old training facility that's right in costa mesa they've now moved to a beautiful facility in el

segundo but if you're at the game last night sunday night football where uh aaron rogers

looked like old man rogers uh but the chargers is that good or bad i didn't call it oh steelers

got smoked luckily i'm an eagles fan so i don't mind aaron rogers is on the seat he's on the

steelers

so if you were there though what i think is super cool about a partnership like that as we dipped

our toes yeah is we had 16 veterans from mandrill okay that were there cool and the way they got to

go to that game is that a colleague from our our office from our team nominated them and said why

and it was grounded in their character it was grounded in their service why they were selected

to represent our company and so if you were there watching on their 80s

80-yard infinity screen you saw our veterans being recognized there and also how much it meant

to them to be there so everything when we look at sports marketing we look at it as a way to

to find the ways that we can yes find value but also to stand out in a way that we have the

ability to do something unique and that we can honor and and reach the military and defense

community so that's why you see us leaning into things like nfl or of course nascar nascar more

than any other sport over indexes on that military and defense community and so that's why we're

leaning into things like nfl or of course nascar nascar more than any other sport over indexes on that

community has about four extra ratings of f1 in america of course and so while we see so much

over saturation in f1 the amount the economics of a deal there to be a mid-level sponsor on a

mid-level team are i know the the disparity in earnings too from when you look at the you know

let's say that the 20th person on the grid is probably making a couple million a year from a

salary standpoint and then some of the you could be like top 20 in nasa you could be like top 20 in

nasa you could be like top 20 in nasa you could be like top 20 in nasa you could be like top 20 in

nascar too and you're just you're earning a good living and so the opportunities for companies to

support a sport that so many americans love and be able to have be a meaningful player in that is is

amazing and this is a call to great brands in this country consumer brands who have exited that sport

i mean nascar is on on the up and up and for us we have this exceptional opportunity to sponsor a

race on a military base it could not be more of a direct target for us and what i what i love so

much about our company this applies to

what i love so much about our company this applies to

whether you're working in design video production marketing comms

is we have the full trust of our founders to make these calls we keep them directly in the loop but

they they trust us to make these big swings and so next june on that base we're going to show up in

a way that no one else in the sport does and we have a partnership directly with hendrick motorsports

and so that's jeff gordon's team yeah and we've got william byron who won the regular season

hendrick also has a defense division like there's all these connective tissues that

we can do storytelling year round yeah talk about the menu of

options for working with nascar broadly it sounds like uh the android 250 it's sponsored of a race

there's also team level sponsors individual driver sponsorships i mean i'm sure some brands are out

there uh paying for promoted posts on the some drivers instagram one-off right uh how did you

land on where you landed and uh do you think this will continue to grow and mutate because

uh you know what we've seen with like red bull like they have one f1 team there's no there's no

red bull race

in f1 it's just the team and so i'm interested to think about what what's out there on the menu

how you landed where you landed sure and i'll talk this about this in the context of nascar

relative to another big swing of ours with ohio state sure sure so with nascar it was about how

do we make a big splash on a major stage especially with america 250 coming up totally i mean it writes

itself especially in that first year sure and with that deal we have the rights to to activate

with the specific team there's actually an activation fund built into our deal to work with

okay we met with eight teams on the grid cool and found the one that really aligned with our values

and that's how we end up with hendrick and we make sense with williams specifically as our driver

but there's many different ways in for us we see this as a relationship that we fully intend to

grow we're going to be with the sport for at least five years i expect that to be much much longer

than that as the sport itself is growing and then you look at that in contrast with ohio state yeah

why did we do the deal with wow state well we're building arsenal one of course our five million

square foot manufacturing facility about 10 minutes away from the heart of the state of ohio state and

we're bringing 4 000 jobs directly another 4 000 jobs indirectly through the build of arsenal one

and so for us we know the the best way to win the hearts and minds of of ohioans is talking to ohio

state and not doing it in a superficial way about just a sports sponsorship but actually thinking

about the ways in which we're going to work together for job placement for stem programs for

community engagement for military community and how we make sure that they have skill bridge and

so for us those are examples of how we're going to work together for job placement for stem programs

where we go broad with nascar and we go deep with ohio state that's a great deflection from just

the truth which is the trey's from ohio and so he's got to go all in i mean trey would have a

sponsor in the bangles right now if he could yeah no i wouldn't be surprised you're doing seven i

don't know he's gonna do it he's gonna do it uh what so what else is uh is special about this

about this race uh walk me through like what race weekend what race week looks like i mean i imagine

a bunch of people from the company are coming out like what are all the different ways that

you are getting the lift out of it 100 we see already uh whether it's from people on the hill

yeah to our our investor community the second we announced that we're doing a race we were

going to call us from from everyone yeah and i'm really excited because i think this will be

a moment that becomes a real focal point for american 250 at large so we're really hopeful

for everyone that you could possibly imagine to to show up to this race yeah so as we lead up to it

we're going to start to drop content away that you typically don't see in sports so whether it's

the scheme which we just finalized on friday oh sure when we finally released that i mean our

design team like knocked out of the park to the helmet delivery essentially exactly delivery to

the fire suit to the die cast cars we're going to make every single thing a moment and then we

got space on the base that we could do some really special uh demonstrations of our product

capabilities yeah so we're working right now with nascar and with the navy to think about the ways

we're going to showcase our product so in theory like yeah like uh fury flyover i mean sooner or

later this is what i'll say uh is that we've done last week as you alluded to earlier our first

flight yeah and just a massive shout out to our our air dominance division like for them to

accomplish what they did and just over 500 days from clean sheet to first flight it's unreal it's

unheard of in the industry all like at the touch of a button yeah it was really cool to be a small

part of that and to observe it but I think it goes from there to first flight to how do we start to

think about ways that we can demonstrate this more clearly in public dive LD demo you got to be just

like yeah it's down there yeah yeah you can't see it we're gonna put ourselves yeah it's down there

yeah trust us we got to do it we got to do a live show from from under the sea and we're showing off

our new stealth technology there's something there I want to share some fun facts please uh from the

don't work at Andrew camp oh yeah you can pivot back uh there's two stories I'd love to share here

one is how this originated so about three months in and friend of the show Matt grin I get a slack

from him that simply says why do you hate interns and I'm trying to distill like the context behind

this and I realize it's because I had responded to uh to our recruiting team about a bit a week

earlier they had shared a post from also uh redact the name of this company their intern post where

it's like 30 smiling interns in front of the

logo saying first day at X company and they said hey can we do this and I said absolutely not we're

not putting that out there that's not the ethos of our company sure and so I said to Graham I'm

like I don't hate interns I hate shitty X company inspired intern posts I said if we're going to

talk about what it's like to work here yeah we should tell the people all the reasons they

should it sure sure and so grim and I went back and forth and started to outline what ended

becoming the the working script and it was largely drawn from Palmer's own words yeah Trey's words

Lulu's words early days of saying hey we're a weapons company yeah and if you don't want to

work on that if you don't believe in the mission if you don't understand why we build what we build

if you're not ready to work your butts off here non-stop if you don't love America and are proud

to say it then don't work here it's like no disrespect but the sooner we understand that

about each other the better and what I love so much about grim two words ship it and from there

that's all we needed and then it was a group of five of us with the our talented uh creative team

Trevor Alex Ben with Jen in the room was there ever a moment where you felt like if you didn't put

that out you would run the risk of people showing up just because Andrew was like a hot stock and

they would be like wait a minute like I actually have like because it seems crazy 100 I mean what

we need out is what I'd call the mercenaries the people that are just there like try to get the

annual equity sure sure we're saying this is extremely hard it's going to be hard guess what

like you're not going to have fun here if all you care about is

trying to get equity yeah yeah do not come here you know we see it because I do the orientation

every two weeks and we have 150 200 new people coming in and I ask people I'm like who saw this

before you started every single hand goes up so what you're speaking to is the greatest measure

of success yeah is that it was a filter for the people that were not mission aligned yeah on top

of that you talk about metrics 30 lift in applications because of that okay yeah what

is the intern cycle like now because it feels like there's more and more people dropping out

of college early is Anderle set up to deal with that I mean I feel like there's some people who

might start intern and then take a gap semester and then wind up just hanging out forever like

Tyler started as an intern and then he took a gas master and uh and Tyler required to dress like you

every day uh well yeah we have like a you know general if ever everyone's wearing white suits

today because the markets are up the market's up so we wear white love it um but uh but I am

interested like uh Palantir has the meritocracy thing going on yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of

there's definitely this idea I mean this goes to back to Peter Thiel and Founders Fund and like a

lot of uh just the idea that like um is the internship even necessary like what are the

roles where the internship makes sense versus just hey you're ready getting getting the lead

it's it's a perfect question especially for right now because we're talking about this all the way

through our executive ranks with our people team about what it actually means to to come here and

what matters yeah and we we call it the the annual Forge program but we're working on the campaign

the the the next sequel if you will to uh to don't work in Andrew sure that won't tell people well we

aren't it's going to speak about what we are sure and what it means to work here and the importance

of of work cool and so it matters way less to us about your quote-unquote credentials we don't care

we care about the the work that you're going to do the alignment to the mission and your ability to

add value yeah yeah it's awesome I don't know if you know this even Jordy but we started our our

Andoril with our intern yeah taking over so like midnight uh my buddy Sean and I were crushing I

think Coors lights and then we we posted just simply don't work at Andoril and we had somebody

give us really good counsel because it was just going to be that and this this man of mystery uh

that uh rhymes with Don Hoogan said to us he said you got to go way way harder than that like you

got such a fertile ground like there's so much

floral lore that there's so many different elements that you could pull from uh from

different things Palmer said sword art all online building Pacific Rim robots uh 10 tweets that our

intern wrote that actually goes written by I think I sent you like 25 and uh and and you picked you

picked oh right right right I know I know this I think uh yeah uh one day we need to post the ones

that didn't make the cut because I love it there might have been some over the line so good uh last

do you think that advertising has changed in the last 50 years huh even in the last 100 years

because when I when I hear you talk you're speaking you know running the marketing organization of of

one of the best modern brands right people can debate people can debate on on whether they like

the brand or not because it's obviously polarizing but great brands are polarizing and when I think

about the strategy it's like ultra clear communication strong

visuals uh leveraging out of home strategically uh you know having these sort of layered strategies

thinking about all these different Architects feels like all the conversations that a that a

strong marketing brand organization would be having 50 years ago and so it's interesting I I

think it's interesting that we have the internet which is like the best marketing Channel in

history and yet the strat marketing strategy hasn't changed very much at all since the

old V days you know yeah what you're describing to me is that what's changed is the medium what

hasn't changed is the desire from an audience for a really clear story and ultimately that's what

we're doing is we're bringing a great craft to our storytelling which most importantly is highlighting

the incredible important work that our engineers and operators are doing for our war fighters and

that's the thing that is consistent with us and and the other thing I think you said

is that we understand that it's not for everyone you know what was important to us is that we have

a really really clear message that people understand what we stand for whether you agree

with it or not and that is what I I love because I'm so mission aligned to what we're building that

I find it a great privilege and responsibility to bring the same type of disruptive approach

to marketing that we are bringing to how we approach contracts how we think about research

and development how we think about engineering or AI or design and

ultimately there's no other place on on Earth I'd rather be fantastic that's a great place to end

it uh well thank you so much for coming by I'm so excited for the Andoril 250 next year next year

can't wait we'll be there I want to be there by the way here's a final idea for you guys this is

my second time officially on yes you guys need like an SNL yeah live timer jacket oh yeah when

cool the 24 side of it there we go this is very cool thank you sir good to see you see you soon

this is good every everyone needs a number for sure there you go I like them uh let's

purpose-built planning and building products meet the system for modern software development

streamlined issues projects and product roadmaps uh there is a video of an

artist tour um that has been burning up the timeline I feel like we should play this um play

it if we can pull it up uh it's going to be about uh two minutes of the uh from Philip kozera I spent

1.5 million dollars building our office after raising a seed round the C 1.5 used to be the

total seed round now I guess it's a 30 million dollars there's some there's some 1.5 million

dollars series A's out there there are if you go back like oh for sure for sure

so so so so let's play this uh and I will be back in just a minute raise 30 million dollars for this

office let's go meet the CEO what is this you're here for an office camera's tracking John dollars

went all right but let's be quick all right you're going surfing dealer come on in this is track how

many times they talk about surfing two three they spent it on vibes coming through this is gonna be

a sauna closet but all of our kite surfing equipment is here and our kayaks are here

he's one of our first investors he joined the company full-time from one employee to 18 in

a year you guys are going fast everyone is doing something having meetings cracked engineers over

here we got Robert Robert doesn't actually do work he's actually looking at saunas right now our new

product is actually called sauna because this man actually came up with the idea while Sony they look

from Iceland yes that guy looks like he's the only one actually working infrastructure engineers do

not like to be disturbed I'm not yes where are you from I'm from Austria can you point at the

Golden Gate Bridge it's right over there can we zoom in on that uh we got any fun stuff here or

is it just nerd gear at me all right this is our movie theater but how many times did you guys watch

a movie here well I actually tried to uh

um I don't know what this company does this they put out this whole video they went viral but it's

unclear what they actually are selling like it they're selling Nordic vibes yeah I mean the vibes

are amazing our European soul and I understand that it's like targeted at hiring because it's

like hey you know we have this beautiful

office you should come work here you should come build on stuff yeah the challenge is unless the

company is like winning and getting better every single day the surfboards start to for sure like

there was this quote post about like hey like you know look at what Jeff Bezos is working on

the door desk back in the day um the other thing is like there there's a little I think this goes

over way differently if this is done by an external influencer like there's been so much attention I

think that's I know what's happening no no oh wait wait really

okay it feels like it's it feels like it's the founder posting I he's post he's posting it but

it's it's I think so I guess they're a product sauna AI okay so they have a it's building the

future of work with sauna we love saunas so sauna can't MP2 um yeah I mean um I oh it's a two you

turn your to-do's into done AI powered workspace it's an AI to-do list something like that um but

there were people that did this exact video on the Gunda like they went to Rainmaker and they were

like um like look at the gym stuff you can you can lift weights here like you there's people over

there working or like uh I I literally went and filmed a video somewhat like this uh at near us

although they were in like a garage and they were they were I just didn't have any surfboards I have

PTSD because I I I knew uh I knew a founder back in the day that every uh he would always go surfing

because he needed to clear his head and I would always be thinking like okay like eventually your

head's got to be clear you just gotta fix the product you can just fix the product and ship

another product and just make it work brother I think if your head's unclearable like we got a

problem yeah and and uh I don't know surfing sir as somebody who's you know grown up surfing

basically every time every at least every week since I've been at been a

fine surfing especially in Northern California to be compatible with work and the reason why is

that wait like a full it takes you out the full day so so the challenge is that in Northern California

even if you're wearing a 5-4 wetsuit which is like basically this thickest five mil five millimeters

on the chest or on the arms what about seven mil web suits you can get those but like you you get

that for like a trip to Alaska or something like that and the challenge is you get cold enough

yeah serving in Northern California even with a five four

that you spend the entire like next like few hours like your body is I just I I'm just laughing that

we're like breaking down like like like it like if he if he if he lived just just two hours South

it'd be totally fine no I disagree it's impossible just analyzing the wetsuit uh no no so you what

type of wetsuit did he have if he's in a if he's in a no it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you

are cold enough that your body uses so much energy to reheat and you just become slow yeah you just

become slow okay and I would struggle with this growing up because I'd go surf after school and

then I'd be doing homework and I'd be like I can't think I I can't like I I just be okay okay you

know yeah incapable of of uh of real productivity so I'm against surfing in the in during the work

week basically yeah I basically don't surf during the work week I'll serve sometimes in the evenings

yeah once you're done with your yeah but they could be doing that they could be they could have

uh surfboards yeah but he mentioned surfing or kite boarding or kite surfing or surfing or kayaking

like so many times at least five times in uh yeah Ryan says there are many doing Dawn Patrol NSF

every day I agree there are I just I just wouldn't be uh VP of vibes uh yeah yeah VP of vibes VP of

vibes engineering customer vibe distribution I I certainly understand why people are are

uh saying that this is maybe a little bit too lackadaisical uh it when you're in the trenches

of the startup culture it was also kind of clickbait because he said the effective cost is

only 250k oh interesting okay so spent 1.5 million but and he got a bunch of like Ti basically okay

well that's cool um anyways uh certainly seems like a nice cool environment hang out and uh

nothing will matter if you build the business you could have made you can make the same argument

he was drinking beers in the office you know there's a famous interview uh Mark Zuckerberg

sitting there chugging a beer out of a solo cup a red solo cup and he was and the interviewer was

like are you sure you want to be chugging this beer in this video and he's like it's okay it

is just funny because but you guys Tyler hyperscaler if Tyler was drinking like this if

Tyler went kayaking yes after the after the show yeah I would just say to him like why don't you

just and then came back and and kept working I'd be like

why don't you just do your work and then go kayak true like why do we need to why do we need to

combine these I don't know it seems seems like mostly solvable if they if the kayaking kite

surfing surfing marathon happens at the right time of the day Tyler put a calendar put a calendar

invite on our calendars for three years from now to check back on word on this wordware video we'll

revisit it because if they have crazy product market fit they're gonna what if the CEO they're

going to look like into being a a world-class surfer and becomes like the next Kelly Slater

and just actually shreds it just rolls the whole he's like we're a surfing company now I'm gonna

get on the tour we earn revenue when I win yeah exactly that would be I would crush and then

you'd be eating your words Jordy you'd be eating your words no we very well we very well could be

uh eating our words in in just a couple years of course like the actual product Gabe says why don't

you do that uh I also like numeral sales tax on autopilot spend less than five minutes per month

on sales tax compliance Ryan says I'm gonna apply need somewhere to store my boat trailer

yeah people just start applying applying because they need they need a place to store their gear

they're like I don't know it seems really well I mean at the same time like like when you're when

like like the when you're in a crowded market the the uh the taste of virality like the the

temptation of like

oh this is good content we should go viral with this has got to be overwhelming because it's like

it's like no one's heard of the company yet it's brand new and you have this opportunity to go do

something that can get a lot of attention I think I think he he invited criticism because he started

it off with clickbait being like I spent one and a half million on our office yes yes yes yes there's

a little bit of too far I also yeah I think I think having someone else do this is is better

have have an actual TikToker come by instead

of doing it as an in-house thing it just has a different aesthetic like if you get stopped on

the street what do you do for a living that's different than paying someone to do a what do

you do for a living video about you I would say right snowflake is gonna beat and if you want

that is one of the greatest videos ever um just like fin.ai one of the greatest actually the

greatest AI agent for customer service they're number one in performance benchmarks they're

number one in competitive bake-offs they have a number one

on g2 let's go to the tyler cam again for some reason what's up with tyler is that

do you want to do you think we should have kayaks in the workplace

yes yes i also think you like kayaking uh probably probably i've gone like once or twice

okay well um our next guest is in the restream waiting room we have kaz from open door in the

tv piano gym welcome to the stream how are you doing here he is welcome thanks for having me guys

i want to go on the record as being pro kayak kayaking in the workplace yes at what point

at what point uh at noon on a tuesday you want your whole workforce going into the frigid ice

cold sea uh with a four millimeter wetsuit and coming back cold and spending the rest of the

day warming up first of all i

grew up in canada so we don't wear wetsuits we just go kayaking i don't know what you guys do

okay okay what's the biggest fish you've ever caught what's the biggest fish you've ever caught

i am i i honestly man this is like my my brother-in-law goes fishing off the coast

of british columbia and catches these massive salmons i am a i'm terrible okay i'm objectively

the worst guy to go out fishing with that's just bad luck i will not catch you anything

it'll be terrible oh well i'll fix your wi-fi okay

go okay there you go that's helpful uh well

you caught a big fish with open door congratulations on the new gig uh i don't know if you remember

but we've actually uh emailed very briefly while you were at shopify you saved my entire company

in like the in like the uh in the span of like two email exchanges so i've always been extremely

thankful to you and just shopify general generally uh but uh can you since this is the first time

on the show can you give us a little bit of backstory on how you wound up at open door what

what the vision was, just like kind of how this all came together,

because it's such a fascinating story to me.

I mean, I think the story has now been fully leaked.

I would not have told it if it just had not been like fully told by other people.

But look, I've been, I loved my job at Shopify.

I genuinely honestly thought it was going to be my forever job.

And I just, I was not planning on leaving,

but I became a little obsessed with Opendoor maybe February of this year.

Where like I, as a kid, I grew up, my mom had a corner store

and I would grow up, I grew up with like a stopwatch timing the cashiers.

So like I have this very odd obsession with like operationally well-run places.

And from the outside, Opendoor looked like a great opportunity being poorly run.

So like sometime in February, almost as a joke that just ought

and would just not leave my brain, I texted Keith, our boy, saying,

hey.

I'm thinking of just buying Opendoor and taking it private because it just

needs to be run better.

And then my, my wife, God bless her, just like thought this was like an

interesting hobby for me to figure out how I could just, I decided on my

desk, fix this company that I wasn't running.

Um, and I became more and more obsessed with it because there's a

very real thing that matters, man.

Like most of us that work in software don't get the opportunity to say, Hey, the

thing we do.

What do we do has a real world impact on actual families, right?

And the very real thing that happens if you grow up in a home that your parents

owned, like your educational outcomes are better, there's less crime in your

neighborhood, like same, same family, same type of thing.

If they own a home, things turn out better.

So I became just obsessed with this company whose job it was to make buying

and selling a home easier and like most other things in the world.

When you.

Reduce friction, you get more of the thing.

So if you think home ownership is good, reducing friction, it will lead to more of it.

But I had just kind of like given up on this idea of taking the company private

because the company had this significant run and well, I didn't have enough money

to take it private anymore.

So, uh, there was a brief window.

You were daydreaming about it.

That was the time.

Yeah.

So, and then it was on, on, it was a Sunday, like in, I want to say mid August, like late.

Last half of August, my wife and I were on the way to church.

I got a call from, uh, Paul D'Aversa, who's a executive and I picked up the call and I said, true story.

And Paul and I had, Paul had been trying to get me to go, go to a couple other places.

And I picked up the call.

I'm like, Paul, I'm on my, on my way to church.

I don't have time.

I appreciate it.

Like, I'm not interested in whatever it is you're about to pitch me.

Maybe if it's open door, let's talk.

And then he said.

He said, it's open door.

How soon can you be on a plane?

Wow.

And we went to church, came back.

I got on a plane.

Yeah.

Uh, and the whole thing, the whole process took maybe two weeks from like that call to, uh, me starting.

How much did you, like, how much did you rely on your network to help you make that decision?

Maybe some trusted advisors, because I imagine there, when, when I, when I saw that you, that you were announced that you took the job, my immediate thought is like, you know, going from.

Shopify, which is this like beloved, you know, incredibly well run company that you can have so much impact on, because it's like one of the, one of the few platforms in the world that is just like, so undeniably pro entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship is so life changing.

And if you care about impact, you know, it's, it's hard to kind of meet your bar, not to mention that.

Jumping in at open door would go from probably like a relatively calm work environment.

Yeah.

To.

one of the most crazy, intensive, high-pressure environment where I'm sure from the amount

of inbound messages that you get running Opendoor is probably a hundred times the messages that

a company a hundred times your size gets, and so it is a wildly different kind of life.

I don't know.

Look, I think Shopify is a relatively intense place to work for all the good reasons, and

you kind of want to work at intense places because you only get one career.

But I remember when I was thinking of leaving Facebook to go to Shopify, literally everyone

I talked to said, don't do it.

Every single person I talked to about leaving Facebook, going to Shopify said, don't do

it.

It's a terrible company.

It's among the most shorted companies in history.

It was obscenely shorted.

It had a really bad reputation.

It was churny.

The day I joined Citrix.

I was like, what?

Citron put out a big research report saying Shopify will go bankrupt in 12 months.

I remember everyone I talked to back then in 2019 told me, don't join Shopify.

Terrible idea.

And what did you see that other people missed?

Look, I thought the mission was a worthwhile mission and that it was very clear

to me that I was the type of person who could help.

I thought the mission was important, the company had done a lot of good, and I could

help.

I couldn't see myself at a bunch of other companies, but I could see myself helping

Shopify.

I became the merchant services guy at Shopify.

I ran the second half of the business.

So Shopify has two parts, SaaS and services.

I ran services for nearly my entire time there.

And then Toby asked me to become the COO and I ran a bunch of other things.

But I remember when I was thinking about going to Shopify.

Basically, the only two things that convinced me to do it were I prayed and I thought it

was the right decision.

And then I sat down with my wife and I said, hey, this is almost certainly a bad idea.

We're going to move to, we're going to move, we had a kid who was less than one and this

probably won't work out, but I think this is a worthwhile mission and I think I can

help.

And then she said, look, it's our job to spend our marriage doing things.

That will make the world a better place.

We call it leaving a dent in the world.

So when it came time to the open door one, I didn't like I talked to Keith because I've

known Keith for a while, but it was just I talked to my wife.

I prayed and I thought I could like have an outsized impact on the company just because

the type of thing I tend to be good at is a type of thing that the company seems to

need.

I'm not, look, I'm no one's idea of a corporate executive.

I cuss a lot.

I grew up as a nerd.

Like I didn't do all that well in my finance undergrad courses.

Like I'm, I'm like, I'm a product manager, right?

I'm like, so this is, and I don't like, this is how I dress.

So I don't like, it was a very real thing.

But I'd opened door.

It felt like I could do well given what the company was doing.

And I was like, okay, this is how I dress.

This is how I dress.

This is what the company's mission was.

And I thought if we could do our job, it would just be good for the world.

So

so yeah.

What, what, what's the, how do you think about the opportunity?

How do you think about the shape of the business in, are you thinking in a decade?

Are you thinking in 30 year timeframe?

Like how do you think about the longterm, uh, strategy, what the opportunity is, what

you want to fix in the short term, medium term, longterm, how you

do it.

We ship every week.

Like we ship every week.

Fuck.

Fuck 10 years.

We ship every single week.

Like our job is to ship product every single week to tilt the world in favor of homeowners

and people working hard to become homeowners.

We ship every week.

Something changes every single week.

We measure ourselves on a weekly basis.

We now have a public dashboard that we use internally.

We just publish it to the world so you can see our internal dashboards externally.

Yeah.

So what are the levers that you can pull in a week to week basis?

What's an example of something that you can, you can roll out?

That actually improves the experience.

I mean, I can tell you, I can tell you a product that took us almost exactly one week to launch.

We launched this thing called peace of mind guarantee.

Okay.

Um, so if you ever bought a house, I remember the first house I bought and the first night

I slept there after we had closed, I'm like, shit, bought the wrong house.

That's the first time.

Like that's a very real thing that happens because in the typical real estate transaction,

the deck is stacked against buyers and sellers.

Okay.

Like everyone involved has a conflict with the, with the two principles.

There's like a real agency problem.

So if you're buying your first home, like the thing that makes you most nervous is missing

something.

Right.

So I think we launched at Opendoor by peace of mind guarantee where you can buy a house

from Opendoor, move in and if you don't like in the first seven days, just give the house

back.

We'll take it back.

Wow.

And.

I think it's one of those things where like, if you buy something on Amazon and you don't

like it, you'd return it.

But for some reason, if you're buying something that's hundreds of thousands of dollars, you

can get duped and there's no one to return it to.

I remember, I think I was, I must've been like some somewhat of a younger teenager when

I was, when I figured out, okay, you make the most important purchase, biggest purchase

of your life, buying a first home and you don't really get like a trot, like you don't

even get to like try it out for a couple nights.

And because I, it's just one of those things, as soon as you actually own something and

you occupy it, you start, you start know you, I know that, you know, I bought a house last

year and I, the things I know, I, I, I missed so many things, you know, I ended up getting

like lucky, right.

It wasn't like I want to return the house, but there were so many just small things that

I noticed immediately from moving in that I completely missed.

And I was like, wow, thank God I didn't that, that there's not that big of a deal or it's

like a.

Uh, a nice to have, whatever.

And dude, there, there, there is a word for people who try to make money off you and then

dodge town.

We call them carnies, carnies, like, and we have turned like the entire real estate industry

essentially into people whose job it is to like kind of hope you don't notice problems.

It's very weird.

It's like, look, we stand by every single home on opendoor.com.

Yeah.

If you don't like it, that's fine.

Yeah.

First seven days, we'll take it back.

Yep.

And I thought this was, this was good.

I didn't think, but wait, you know what happened from a second?

We thought we should do this to time.

It was live was about seven days, genuinely.

And the reason that was true is because there's a bunch of people in the path of doing this,

whose job it is at any big company to go, but actually sure.

Experts say this, there's risks.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

As a buyer, are you more likely to buy a home from Opendoor.com?

If I tell you if you don't like that you can return it.

Yes or no?

Yes.

Yeah of course.

Great.

Let's go.

Do we stand by our homes?

So, it's a little bit of an actuarial puzzle that you have to figure out, okay, what is

the cost for that and then distribute that over the over the buyers of that product.

That seems like something a technologist, a product manager can probably do.

Not much.

Can be.

Yeah.

somebody who's a little bit more forward thinking is completely set up for that makes a ton of sense

um what what else is changing in the market i i'd love to get your thoughts on the 50-year

mortgage that was proposed is that good for america is that good for open door is that

something we should be supporting yeah people have been comping it to what happened with japan's

market after they introduced 50-year yeah i i did see some people say oh it might be bad but what

what break it down look i i let me um do the thing that i'm not supposed to do and answer

the question honestly i i i think that people who compare this to japan are just deeply

misunderstanding a bunch of things about the american economy like let's just be clear like

the american and western economies are just fundamentally different because culture is

fundamentally different and the economy is downstream from culture like it's a very real

thing that that matters but secondarily

like let's go back um democracy in america tocqueville um in it he talks about how the

main difference between america and every other country is that americans own the ground

they stand on it has been historically true that americans have had a higher ownership

of the land that they live on than any other nation and this has been basically the main

difference between the american i own this land i'm part of this community than the transient

european and eastern lifestyles right if you divide the worlds into people who are from

somewhere and people who are from anywhere america is full of people who are from somewhere

this makes a difference this makes a real difference to how people are raised how kids

are raised uh the economy to come the country overall now why is a 50-year mortgage incredibly

important you would not have needed a 50-year mortgage 20 years ago you just wouldn't need

it in fact when the 30-year mortgage came

in in 1931 i want to say everyone literally said all the things they're saying about

the 50-year mortgage this won't work it's too long how can people pay it off but the

thing 50-year mortgage does is this the 30-year mortgage was designed for a time when people

didn't have student debt where the average life expectancy was about 15 years shorter

the average work time was about 15 years shorter like there's a very real thing where people

are buying homes later and later we just cross the average homeowner buying their first one

at 40 because student debt is crushing american debt to income ratios what the 50-year mortgage

allows you to do is to get into the market which is the best market americans have historically

gone to it's the main source of leverage americans get access to without being a big company and

being a fancy person right you get access to that leverage you can do it while paying

down your student debt and once you pay on your student debt there's nothing that says

you can't refi and pay it down faster

but the 50-year does fix what's called a debt to debt to income ratio for folks while

they're getting started and like i think it is incomplete there's another thing that's

important like the people who are against the 50-year mortgage are coming out you don't

no one's forcing you to take a 50-year mortgage you can still take the 30 or the 15.

but what you're saying is i wouldn't need it therefore no one can have it well guess

what buddy not everyone lives in palo alto yeah it's interesting you know the one one

thing that came to mind

for me was you know what you've seen in the automotive industry where typically 60 month

is maybe like the i imagine that's the most popular right uh and then there's 72 month

and if you look on sites like uh dupont registry john you'll appreciate this they have like

a 200 month uh you know uh oh yeah auto loan for supercars and it's interesting that you

know that those have been getting pushed out but the issue with cars is that their assets

that almost always depreciate massively and even on faster and faster time zero yeah and

even if you look at evs now they they depreciate at at you know levels that you haven't seen

with um uh ice you know cars so yeah it's uh i guess i guess that you know i think part

of the part of maybe the frustration and the reaction was you know this is a way to increase

demand but it doesn't fix the supply side and so yeah maybe it's

focused on kind of the wrong we should fix the supply side too look i think we should

take what we should understand what the government's saying and they literally said this they said

this is one of the things we're doing not the last thing we're doing and by the way

in the last four weeks they've also done a bunch of other things they just changed the

requirement on credit ratings to just change the requirement they just announced that they're

going to have a new fico score in there they've look do i think they should do things to make

supply more readily available yes

i think they've talked about making one-time

assumable mortgages more available that will also change the supply obviously i think we

should basically force cities to just stop being so anti-builder like the builders are

desperate to build let them build i think there's a bunch of things we should do like

this is not this is a problem that was created over a decade we're not going to solve it

overnight but one of the things we must do is fix this

we can't just start moving down that road and say hey fix this and just try it again

and fix it again or do it a little further or do it a little more and then we can't do

it anywhere else so i'm not going to do it anymore because most of the time we're just

going to be wasteful we're not going to move forward we're going to keep trying to find

a way to fix it and that's what i think we should do and i also think that's what people

are talking about right we should learn from people who are saying well here's what we

do clear over here do that and then once we're done here we are going to start doing something

we should do something just like that do that i think in a way that's very transformative

homeownership is. What are your thoughts on stock-based comp? Keith Reboy was getting in

the fight with somebody years ago about stock-based comp. It feels like for some of these companies

that are more mature, maybe you don't need to lean on it as much, but also there's certain

accounting rules that make it maybe more advantageous to use it. Obviously, from the

startup world, it makes sense to incentivize your employees with stock-based comp, but how are you

thinking about it? Is there anything that is changing? Look, my salary is a dollar. I get

paid $1. My entire comp is stock-based based on performance measures. We're hitting the size gong

for one of the highest salaries. Infinitely more than $0 salary. That's right. Yeah, so I'm not

I'm not

I'm not

I'm ideological on this issue, which I think for a very long time, corporate executives have

gotten rich driving their companies down in valuation and essentially failing their way

to becoming millionaires. This is a very weird world where we've created where you are incentivized

to suck at your job and do nothing lest you get noticed. If you don't get noticed, you're not

going to get fired.

If you don't get fired, you're IRS user vest and you become rich. This is the story of so many great

companies. This is terrible. This is just terrible for capitalism because as the American people

rightly recognize, this is a scam. A world in which corporate executives get rich, shareholders lose

money. That's terrible. I think corporate executives basically should only get paid in options.

Now, it's actually difficult to only get paid in options. I tried.

Sure, sure.

But there's a way to get paid in options. I tried. There's a way to get paid in options. I tried.

Sure, sure.

But there's a way to get paid in options. I tried.

Sure, sure.

Sure, sure.

Sure, sure.

I mean, we've essentially at Open Door reconstructed options as RSUs. So the PSUs,

if the stock goes below what it was the day I joined, I get paid actually zero.

Wow.

Like actually zero, nothing. And then there's like the cliffs above that.

Do they take away your dollar or you get to keep it with a $1?

Yeah. Well, you know what the funny thing is?

They should be able to claw back the dollar.

They should be able to claw back the dollar.

I have to pay for benefits.

Oh, sure, sure, sure.

I have to pay the company for taxes.

I see your way down, actually.

So I pay Open Door to work at Open Door.

Sure, sure, sure.

Yeah.

Which I think is perfectly fine, by the way.

Wait, so this is sort of like, do you feel like you're in the

in the lineage of Elon Musk's newest pay package, like heavily comp aligned to market cap?

Is that where this is all going?

I mean, I'm missing a couple of zeros.

Okay. Yeah, of course.

But yeah, I can't find a problem with that package.

I love it.

I just think it's so aligned.

I think it's a very real thing.

I think very few traditional executives would take it.

Like very few traditional executives would take it.

But I think what shareholders should want is none of those executives to be in charge of publicly

traded companies.

This is like, this is a very real thing.

I think in the private world, a very good indicator that a startup's going to fail is

if the founder pays himself a very large salary.

Sure.

Sure.

Like, I mean, I do some angel investing that my wife insists we list under charitable giving

on our families.

Yeah.

But in my experience, if the founders pay themselves a very large salary, the company

is going to go to zero relatively quickly.

Yeah.

Somehow corporate executives get paid like in cash, like five, $10 million, and in RSUs,

another five, $10 million.

$10 million.

$10 million.

$10 million.

$10 million.

$10 million.

Basically be as inoffensive as possible and listen to the consultants.

Right?

This is what happens, right?

Like you have some-

Listening to the experts again.

Yeah.

This is like a real man.

Like you pay a comp consultant to come give you advice on compensation.

Then you go to a management consultant to give you advice on management.

Then you go to a financial consultant to give you advice on finances.

Then you go to a PR consultant.

Before you know it, this is what happened.

I came to Opendoor and I went through every...

Every bill the company had paid for the previous six months.

Like actually every bill line by line.

I'm like, what was this for?

What was the outcome?

And the company, I paid them millions of dollars.

Millions.

Like it was actually, I think number three on the expense line item.

Like we paid more for consultants than we paid for a snowflake, which is like-

That's something, yeah.

Wow.

And like to what end?

The company was basically going to zero.

And, but corporate exec, but like fancy types who got MBAs from fancy schools,

do that to avoid being noticed and getting fired, right?

That's the goal.

And I think corporate executives should get paid only when they make shareholders money.

Yep.

I like that a lot.

This was fantastic.

The chat is absolutely loving this.

I wish we could go longer.

We'll have to have you back.

You're welcome anytime there's news or anything.

Jordan, do you have one last question before we-

Man, I have a lot more questions.

I have a lot more questions.

Let's make it a regular thing.

We just have someone in the Restream waiting room.

But thank you so much for taking the time.

I'd love to go deeper.

Also, I mean, I just feel like we can talk about like anything, really.

Like there's so much here.

Yeah.

We barely, when I asked about strategy, we spent five minutes on one particular product

and we could do that probably every single week since you're shipping so quickly.

Yeah, I would say as there's more news on mortgages, both the assumable side, the term,

Yeah.

you should come back on.

We'd love to have you back.

This is fantastic.

I think it's 30 seconds to do something.

I promise it'll be only 30 seconds.

Please, please.

If you are watching this show and you're a founder type, the odds are you're an odd duck.

You're swimming in the wrong sea.

Find me on X.

My DMs are open.

We're hiring in offices.

This is not a remote company.

We're in offices with our colleagues working incredibly hard for a future that matters.

So find me.

Fantastic.

And we'd love to have more.

We'd love to have more folks join the mission.

Yeah, we'd love that.

Everyone's clapping here.

I love your perspective and how you're approaching this.

And I can't wait to see all the progress you and the team make.

Yeah, highly recommend it.

Thanks, guys.

It's a generational opportunity.

Great to see you.

Cheers.

Cheers.

Bye.

Let me tell you about Addio, customer relationship magic.

Addio is the AI native CRM that builds, scales, and grows your company to the next level.

Our next guest is already in the Restream waiting room.

We got Paul Needham from the Infatuation.

Here he is.

Welcome to the show.

Look at that background.

That is very cool.

Look at this setup.

I love it.

Thank you, guys.

What a fun brand exploration.

Very cool.

Great to have you on the show, Paul.

Chris, your co-founder, is a good buddy.

And yeah, it's great to have you here.

Thank you.

Yeah, Chris and Andrew started Infatuation now 16 years ago.

So we just celebrated our sweet 16 at Veselka in New York.

Yeah, exactly.

Longevity is a good thing, and we're really proud to be carrying the tradition on and to

continue to shine a light on all the great restaurants all over the country.

And that's what we're out doing this week is talking about our Best New Restaurants campaign.

Let's talk about it.

Break it down.

All right.

So our team all over the country and in London, we went to over 5,000 restaurants this year.

Spots, bagel places, pizza places all the way, especially out in LA.

You guys have a lot of fine dining.

A lot of omakase, and we checked it all out and we crowned some of our favorites.

So out in LA, places like Baby Bistro, River, Mustard's Bagels, Beethoven Market, and a bunch

more, and then all over the country, looking not just at the best restaurants.

I really liked Jules in San Francisco this year for pizza.

Smithereens is our number one in New York, but also looking at the trends and what are

we seeing out there?

What are the threads?

So obviously, Martini has continued to-

How many people do you need to properly evaluate 5,000 restaurants?

What does a team look like to pull that off?

I'm assuming it's some internal, some external.

Some of it's internal, some of it's freelance.

The fun of it is bringing your friends because you can't go to a restaurant as one person

and try everything.

Yeah.

So we do a...

And a lot of restaurant critics the time.

And other places do it also.

But we bring some folks around.

We dine anonymously.

We book under fake names.

We pay for all the meals ourselves, called as we see it.

And yeah, it's a big effort from a lot of people.

It's also, we go back.

And so we want to give places that chance, especially when we're talking about a best

new restaurant category.

Want to give people the chance to really show their best.

And yeah, we have a team around 50 people who...

Who work on this for us.

And then, yeah, some freelancers and other folks as well.

That makes sense.

What is going on...

Give us an update on the restaurant industry broadly.

That was...

Obviously, restaurants tend to reflect...

End up reflecting the state of the culture and the economy.

And there was some reporting last week that we touched on briefly that McDonald's is seeing

a drop in...

In...

In...

Purchasing from some lower income folks.

That was surprising.

I think people were pretty bearish about that.

Maybe there's a different story there.

But we'll talk about kind of the health of restaurants broadly.

I'm assuming it's like a pretty wide disparity.

Yeah.

And it's a complicated situation because you've obviously got Chipotle and others who have

been out talking recently.

But then, you know, the Wall Street Journal, I thought, had a good piece a week or so ago

about how in New York, the kind of rich are keeping the party going.

I think definitely when you talk to restaurateurs, look, folks in LA have had a tough year, no

question.

I'm sure you guys hear that a lot.

Hopefully starting to come back and...

And is that driven by the...

Is that downstream from like the film industry not doing well?

So just people in the creative world film are just...

Entertainment are just eating out less?

You need expense accounts, you know, especially...

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

If you got a lease in Beverly Hills or you got a lease in West Hollywood, like you need

people to be able to put a corporate card down and spend a little more freely.

But look, I think it's interesting also you look at some of those trends and then you

also look at things like $10 pastries and really elaborate matcha drinks and these small

indulgences that people are definitely still treating themselves to.

I mean, the cinnamon roll situation in New York.

Had an outrageous year.

Wait, is that the name of the restaurant?

No, it's just, you got one...

I thought a restaurant called the cinnamon roll situation.

It's a steakhouse.

It's like we got a situation down here.

It's a situation that we're monitoring, we're monitoring.

But I was on Squawk Box this morning and the Today Show earlier and we brought pastries

to all that.

And it was like one cinnamon roll just got crazier than the next.

And...

That's hilarious.

So definitely, I think the restaurant industry situation is a big complex narrative across

QSR, across fine dining, et cetera.

I think the customer indulging themselves, treating themselves as another situation.

And then look, there's no question that people drinking less is a huge factor for restaurant

tours.

And the folks who we're all friends with in the industry, definitely if you're not selling

wine and you're not selling cocktails.

That's a mighty headwind.

That's your profit margin.

Yeah.

But look, you see the $20 mocktail on a lot of menus now.

And definitely folks are trying to make the non-alc stuff happen and trying to make some

money off non-alc.

But it's definitely a much...

Yeah.

So from what you're hearing or seeing, some people have gone from drinking to no drinking.

And then a lot of other people have gone from heavy drinking to just moderate drinking.

And so they're seeing both types of guests just spending less.

I recently went from no drinking to heavy drinking.

It's been great.

You guys are keeping the industry afloat.

Look, I think there's a lot of people...

Obviously, wellness is a huge factor in so much stuff.

We also see that in the hour people are eating.

So all of a sudden, 5.30 is a really hot time to go to a restaurant where...

Yeah.

A few years ago, you were embarrassed to ask someone to go to dinner at 5.30.

I think there's a lot of people...

I'm so clearly the problem.

I like to go to dinner at 5.30, sometimes 5.

I don't like to be digesting food when I'm going to bed.

Yeah, I like that.

And I have one drink a month.

Our audience is a lot of tech people.

Do you have a recommendation for a restaurant that might be particularly good for planning

a coup?

If you're planning a boardroom coup...

Or maybe celebrating a successful boardroom coup, do you have a recommendation for a restaurant?

And this needs to be in like the South Bay?

I mean, ideally San Francisco, but boardroom coups are happening all over.

Maybe in New York as well.

San Francisco...

Look, a lot of great places.

I mentioned Jules Pizza earlier.

That's where I would plot my coup.

Is it quiet?

Right now.

You're not going to be overheard there?

There's like some corners.

You could tuck into a corner.

We could tuck into a corner.

I like...

The mayor was there recently and was like...

Blowing them up.

Okay, that's good.

And they're where the action is.

Yeah, I feel like the proper environment to plan a coup is sort of like leather booths.

Ideally some mahogany.

Some mahogany.

Something like very...

Where every little booth is like nestled off to the side.

No one can really see each other too much.

You know in New York, a New York little interesting development this year that did not get a lot

of attention, but Fort Charles opened a private dining room.

Mm-hmm.

And so for as hard as it is...

To get a reservation at Fort Charles, the private dining room, if you got like 12 grand

for a table of eight.

Okay.

They will have you any night you want.

There might be tens of billions of dollars at stake.

So what's the point of spending 12K on a steak?

That's no problem.

Yeah, I always like Pacific Dining Car in LA.

That feels like a good place to plan a coup.

I like a mafia movie vibe.

How is Instagram still having the...

So I don't identify as a foodie at all.

I enjoy food.

I don't spend a ton of time seeking it out, but there's been a lot of conversation over

the last probably decade now around how Instagram is just driving every city on earth to look

the same.

So no matter where you go in the world now, you can get a matcha and you can get New York

style pizza from somebody who was maybe living in New York.

Two years ago, whatever.

Is there any parts of the US that are fighting back against that and really trying to create

a more localized food culture?

And is that even possible anymore?

Yeah.

I think definitely everything you're saying, you see the matcha thing get crazier and crazier

month by month.

I saw Lauren Sherman said over the weekend, matcha is like kale.

People are just doing things to matcha that shouldn't be done.

I think you've got pizzas everywhere, no question, and really good pizzas everywhere.

And to your point, Mexico City is everywhere now where every New York big opening this

year is like Mexico City inspired in some way or another.

I would say like Nashville, I'd point to Texas.

There's definitely pockets where you're seeing people really do something that's

very unique.

I think Miami has been an incredible food scene for us in the last few years and definitely

Miami, even if it's not cuisine per se, like the personality of a Miami restaurant.

Sunny's, which is one of our favorite steak houses down there, that restaurant could only

be in Miami and you definitely feel that you're in Miami when you're there.

But look, Beethoven Market, when you're sitting out on that terrace in Mar Vista, there's

stroller parking.

It very much feels like, oh, this is the west side of Los Angeles.

And Wild Cherry, which just opened in the West Village of New York, which is the A24

restaurant, like it very much feels like, oh, we're in a kind of like New York canteen

connected with a small theater.

So there's definitely still places that are kind of creating that sense of unique personality.

This is very cool.

Thank you for coming on and giving us the update.

Yeah, guys.

I've held out, by the way.

I haven't had a matcha.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

They tried it a long time ago, and I haven't I haven't gone back.

It's not for me.

Yeah.

Not for me.

We'll send you there's some good powder ones you can make at home that are really

easy and pretty good for sure.

Fantastic.

Thank you guys.

And congrats.

Thank you.

Everyone's watching, man.

Everyone's watching.

Thank you for coming.

Thanks so much.

Have fun.

Thank you for giving us an update on the state of the market and congrats on the launch.

We'll see you.

Have a good one.

Cheers.

Let me tell you about public.com investing for those.

those that take it seriously they got multi-asset investing industry they're trusted by millions

we are completely switching gears now from food and beverage to jordan nanos at uh semi-analysis

taking us through the latest from cluster max this is cluster max 2.0 correct that's right yeah

what are the biggest findings how do you introduce cluster max uh in the you know 140 characters

version i'd love to just get into the actual findings yeah it's great to be here with two

of my technology brothers thanks there we go i can definitely uh yeah i can definitely take you

through cluster max basically um the way we see it some of the most critical transactions in ai

are happening when people are renting gpus from a provider yeah so this is companies like core

weave navius lambda fluid stack crusoe they've been coming to market and taking share from

you know aws azure yeah gcp oracle and i think a lot of people basically

are

they think that all gpus are deployed the same and that's definitely not the case so we go through

in this article a lot of details about how our hands-on experience and then feedback from

customers kind of makes it clear that um it really depends which provider you go with when you're

making a critical decision like where to buy your gpus yeah how do you uh how do you actually feel

like you're getting accurate data because if you have a semi-analysis email shows up and i'm

running a neocloud i'm like yeah let's put them in the best data center we have i think that's

what i imagine uh so are you it feels like blind taste testing we were just talking to a restaurant

reviewer i feel like you're a data center reviewer there's these segments are actually pretty similar

fake fake companies even get them into yc and just sign up yeah something's going on but yeah uh

talk about the pitfalls of the processor like how you actually tease out what's actually going on

yeah i don't know if we're really doing a secret shopper thing quite the same like we definitely

got cto on the phone in some cases to walk us through the greatest but um in my research i talked

to a lot of different customers of these neoclubs to get their perspective on exactly what their

experience was with reliability and support at scale and i think it was quite revealing because

um like i said yeah sometimes you get a really good experience in one data center that's quite

different from somebody who's running stuff in iceland or something like that so what changed

this uh with this version i know that the actual graphic has exploded there's more there's going to

be more we need more do we need more neoclouds by the way are there enough do you think there's a do we

have enough but yeah what else was what else did you find um hey we need more man we need more of it

all let's hear it for more more yeah thank you for the tireless work indexing the entire market

uh yes but what were the findings yeah look i think um we probably don't need a lot more

silicon valley back to venture startups that are all renting gpus from another provider and

selling them with a bit of software on top of them but um we're seeing a lot of the

like sovereign ai projects just get started and it looks a lot like a telecom build out where

um you know different regions or countries have their own regulations or you know their own

sovereign wealth funds that are funding the build out of a bunch of gpus yeah and i think that's

just getting getting started so you're right the biggest difference is we covered 84 neoclouds this

time as opposed to 26 last time our total market view there's now 213 learned about four of them

since we published last week

they're like hey i mean if you're neocloud and you're not on the list

it's probably fair for the investors to send you that and be like hey

i mean we're doing our best to get coverage but they they pop up all the time with different

people who are in different phases of actually launching yeah but uh yeah what what what are

the biggest movers what were the biggest surprises what were the biggest changes um because it seems

like corey has done well last time this time um but there's probably some other folks who have taken

uh taking your feedback and and actually made changes yeah i think probably the two big ones

are that fluid stack debuted at gold like we did not rate them last time and they're they're kind

of coming out of nowhere with a really interesting offering for taking other let's say bronze or

worst tier gpus and making them usable for frontier labs like they have some really really

big customers um i think google improved a lot if the market had really shifted to

using strictly blackwell gpus and wasn't still stuck on using some of their old hopper gpus with

their older networking um i would see would have seen google you know possibly push to gold i think

they will in the future they've been really improving um we've got a lot more work to do

with aws i think they they're really focused on efa and the rest of the experience is coming along

but their networking is just look it represents like less than one percent of the cluster tco by

the users tell us it's like more than half of their debugging time is trying to figure out

aws's custom networking on some of these clusters so we'll see who takes the feedback and who doesn't

going forward we try to be effective and like include a lot of stuff from those customers in

there as opposed to just you know a micro benchmark that we run on the network ourselves

yeah that's super interesting jordy i wanted to get your read on depreciation schedules i

feel like there's a big debate and something that's going to be critical to the health of a

person as chips get better uh you would hope that that uh the depreciation schedules you know

would expand somewhat but we're seeing it all all over the board in terms of how different companies

from hyperscalers to some of these new entrants are actually planning around depreciation and i

would love to kind of hear how you how you think about it broadly okay um i think broadly speaking

is a financial metric that's hard for us to measure and varies between the different providers

quite substantially where people take different approaches from three to six or longer years

in terms of the lifespan of the actual technology like there's there's two ways to think about this

one is how long does the thing keep running well before it starts to have a lot of wear out

failures like the gpu and the system and then the other one is how long is it useful on a performance

per dollar

basis and i think um that second one really depends on how good future gpus are

so right now we are seeing providers who are limited on power they literally have no more

floor space in their data center rip out perfectly good gpus that are making them plenty of money

to replace them with the latest and greatest because they can make even more money wow and so

if that power constraint goes away or the newest latest and greatest gpus don't give you that mass

of performance increase then i think people will sweat the assets for longer functionally in the

data center but i think a lot of people on the financial side are playing a guessing game or

they're designing it based on how they want to design the financials of their business and not

necessarily taking into account exactly how the gpus perform or what's coming down the pipe

is that is that bad i don't know if it's bad i think it's just pragmatic like if you look at a

at a hyperscaler and you see that they have all of these build outs of new data centers coming

online and they want to um look they want to address the needs of that customer base and

things just aren't coming fast enough ripping out old gpus and putting in new ones seems like it's

a good play it seems like it's good for the people who want the best performance it seems like them

you know they're going to get more revenue per megawatt with the latest and greatest

um i don't think it's necessarily good or bad for anybody what about what about so

satya has talked a lot about wanting a a diverse gpu fleet fungibility of of the fleet not wanting

to just do exactly what like a key customer like open ai wants if open ai says hey build this data

center for this specific training run he's not immediately saying like yeah of course i'll do it

no no questions asked he's sort of like you know being pragmatic about it how much do you worry

with some of these other neo clouds about being like too indexed to a

specifically

specific type of like workload or tech stack uh given how fast the you know space is evolving

and ending up in a situation where they just have a bunch of dead weight yeah that's a really good

question and i think uh you're segwaying into an article that we got coming out later this week and

a fun interview that um that some of the guys did so uh let me try and not talk about that while

still teasing it uh basically yeah i think the

um the the concept of fungibility is really important to the hyperscalers and um it seems

like in some ways they are exploiting the neo clouds for better or worse who have you know

four sites and they're going to take a whole site and have it all one chip and that's going to be a

bet for three to five years and we'll see what happens after that so um in some ways investors

kind of view this as returning the

ai market beta versus getting some alpha on an individual chip or on an individual workload

and uh i think it's look there's a lot of upside in this and to your point that focus on fungibility

or pragmatism may have led to microsoft alert losing like 320 billion dollars of rpo to oracle

announced a couple of months ago yeah at reasonable margins so you know i i think uh

time will tell on that decision at some analysis generally speaking you're going to come to us and

get a pretty bullish take we were way ahead of the market on that oracle print last quarter and let's

give it up for bullish takes yeah yeah that makes sense uh how does uh with with fleet fungibility

when you see you know on cluster max there is azure and then there's also a bunch of neo clouds

that have partnerships with microsoft like nebius um how does that actually work if you're a lab and

you go to azure and you say i want gpus from azure and then satya says oh i have some i guess

yes and then i'm dealing with like you know the intrinsic details of this part of part of me

more close yeah part of me though is like like who do you think is going to be able to make the

better call microsoft and satya or oracle when it comes to capitalizing on all that demand from

open ai right who has more information who has more experience

you know working with open ai who has you know handling these uh you know training runs it's like

i don't want to i don't yeah again time will tell right it could have been like the most brilliant

move ever from oracle but at the same time i have to imagine oracle is like basically we we had a

graph last week on on kind of understanding where the where the ai players sit on this idea of like

uh how much they need like agi

versus don't need agi and how much they believe in agi and how much they don't and we're putting

uh larry like way up in the left corner of like uh needs agi but doesn't necessarily believe in it

hasn't issued public statements at least but uh i just feel like uh very much like a hail mary from

uh hail mary from oracle and if they if if the depreciation schedules are quite a bit different

than what they're planning they will open ai will have gotten the much better end of that deal and

i think satya could end up looking pretty smart for um not going after it but who knows yeah i i

mean i tend to agree i don't think such as look dumb very many times in his career i think he

gives very thoughtful answers when it comes to this stuff um i do think in some respect it's a

matter of timing like

if you look at what microsoft's build out looks like right now they are accelerating and that's

on the back of openai but also some of their sas products that are using this technology

they have access to all of openai's ip through 2032 so they're certainly exposed to

any upside on that side and yeah it's it's a matter of when you want to take your free

cash flow down to zero to do a build out and oracle seems to be the first one to have moved while my

electrician was working at openai we've moved really quickly to the next level in order to

start 2021 and they've been working a lot more aggressively with openai because of that so

unfortunately today does not exist on openai's ip it needs to be done uh and it needs to be done

in order to be able to launch it so yeah it's a matter of you know what i mean i think they wanted

to do i mean it's it's kind of a this is really a start and you know i think they're telling the

world that they're going to come up with something going to be a little different

and that's what they're doing now that they're in the middle of a kind of a you know that's

not what they're doing now they're going to come up with an episode and they're going to have a

we're seeing sovereign AI in other countries. I'm assuming we'll see some version of it here.

But what's your, what do you rate the likelihood that we could see a scenario where the government

would effectively be guaranteeing loans for AI, you know, data center build outs?

Yeah. I don't know how much I have an opinion on that. When I read into it, it seemed like they

weren't actually asking for a backstop or a bailout. Yeah. And I agree. I agree with you

there. Our understanding of it was it wasn't asking for a backstop on open AI or any type

of bailout. It was just like the language implied that they would be open to a world where data

centers would be treated like some other categories around national security, like manufacturing,

where the government would basically want to encourage the development of data centers by

saying like, we're going to guarantee these loans, which would just encourage lenders to

have more confidence to lend against assets that might depreciate faster than people think and

present some risk. Yeah. And I a hundred percent agree in terms of guarantees. We see this elsewhere

in the world quite substantially where there's governments in the Middle East, Norway,

Canada, to a small extent, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, India, they're all like getting in on

building a neocloud and the US government has not gone out and built a neocloud,

but they certainly build supercomputers for defense intelligence research. And they certainly

have a vibrant community of companies. So I think there's more that the government can do to

accelerate the time in which you can build a data center behind the meter, which a lot of places are

trying to do right now without interconnect. Semi-analysis, we've got an energy model coming

soon. That's sort of a companion to our data center model. We've got guys on the team working

on that who were grid operators in their previous job. And they've got a lot to say about the lead

times to get turbines right now, or how much red tape there is to get nuclear wind, solar online,

um, how you need guarantees.

from the utility, even if you're behind the meter, uh, as some sort of, you know, future

interconnect agreement or some sort of stabilizing power load, or, I mean, there's, there's just so

many creative things that could be done with the grid in the US that I think are kind of

fundamental before you can have discussions about financing a lot of stuff, because look, when we

get in conversations with investors, I think there's a whole bunch of capital to be unlocked

in the private equity space.

Yeah.

That is just getting started. And it feels like early innings because VCs are the first ones to

move and they have in the neocloud space, but we haven't seen a lot of like institutional players

decide to make a, make a bet on this the way they have with energy, with housing, with commodities.

And if GPUs are going to be fundamental and they're going to be a commodity and people want

to bring like an H 100 index to the market, you're going to see a lot of like institutional capital,

try and pour its way in here.

Yeah.

And like functionally, how does that work? I think it actually comes in terms of like

accelerating the existing data center projects, as opposed to having the US just start to build

something new. So to that extent, like totally agree with everything. I think the market kind

of shuttered at those comments because it seemed like they were asking, opening eyes, asking US

government to pick a winner when that is clearly not the case. Like there are winners and losers

being shaked and shaken out.

Yeah, I think that's it.

I think that's it.

Yeah.

And I think there's there's a lot of things in here that are kind of, you know,

we've talked about like chat research coding, but we're in the early innings of video and image

generation of material science of drug discovery, of weather prediction, all of these models that

are showing incredible early results from transformer based architectures running on

the same GPUs as the chat models that could be the lion's share of compute in the future, if suddenly everybody wants real time generated video on their feed or we're making small weather predictions for example, if we're all moving to the sea and there might be a lot of here to be made in a really long time.

Yeah, it's not all going to be only one of the challenges and that's it, but it's really important that we have to think about this.

on their feed or we're making small weather predictions for everybody who's getting ready

to go skiing or something like yeah fascinating i would like to see more ai on the slopes on the

slopes i like the sound i like bring it to veil semi-analysis can do a ski trip invite all the

different uh players in uh bringing ai to uh the mountains that's fascinating please invite us

yeah uh very excited for the energy model you can call it powder max uh whoever's working on that

as soon as you launch energy max uh we want to talk to you guys we always enjoy talking to

everyone at semi-analysis uh such thorough research such uh deep insights we really

appreciate that time yes chad's uh great to see you jordan thanks for coming on

you guys too yeah you're welcome to whistler anytime amazing amazing uh let me tell you about

adquick.com

out-of-home advertising made easy and measurable say goodbye to the headaches of out-of-home

advertising only adquick combines technology out-of-home expertise and data to enable

efficient seamless uh ad buying across the globe our next guest is isaiah taylor from

velar atomics congratulations isaiah how are you doing look at this you look suited up

congratulations second time on the show uh give us give us the story what happened today

yeah first of all the eagle screech was fantastic timing there because we have our beautiful

nuclear test site out in the back of the house and we're going to be doing a lot of

stuff except for the soundboard we actually did not already so i'm going to go ahead and

just do the soundboard and get it ready and go into the chair with you guys for a bit

of time okay so i'm pretty excited to be back here in the middle of utah desert fantastic

job producers uh yeah we that was me that was jordy sorry i'm sorry i stole the soundboard

glory no they they they generate the sounds and i time them so i said i figured that so

it's even more impressive because the producers were cooking that up in the five seconds before

when they saw my background yeah then you can hit play we got so many sounds we got here i got i got sounds for days that's exactly what it sounds like it's fun to be in the show though and i

for days that's exactly what it sounds like when one of our nuclear reactors starts up

uh no it's we're having a great day it's it's an amazing day for valor atomics we announced a 130

million dollar uh series a earlier today let's go nice congratulations that is a proper gong that's

your series a it's like you i thought i feel like you had raised a series a before wow a lot no it

was a seed riot i didn't realize that's right we announced a 19 million dollar seed round earlier

this year yeah and and actually we built our reactor on a seed round and we didn't turn it

on so now we have enough capital to go turn it on okay and uh this is something i'm super proud of

the team for by the way because i i think this is like how venture is supposed to work you you

hopefully turn something on in the series in the series a this is like when you find you know

product market fit uh so i'm super proud of the team it's this is our goal go split the atom with

this capital yeah i mean yeah the whole story here makes so much sense because um like you started

with like the really really big vision like uh or a per

you know nuclear power into energy that could be transported actual like you were going to

synthesize hydrocarbons and you laid out this big vision but then that was almost like act

three and then act one was like can we actually build something that doesn't even turn on but

just shows that we can actually build something then let's go turn it on let's start generating

energy then if we have abundance and tons of energy then let's figure out what next to do

and i think people were always like a little bit thrown by how far you were thinking into

future and they were like well let's see what this guy can do in six months and then you delivered on

the six month project and now i think people are waking up to what you're building is that how

you've experienced it i think that's that's an accurate perception and i've certainly learned

a little bit about how to pitch the story we i i talk a little bit more about the short term now

but i think about the long term every single day totally um i mean this i think this is as my life's

work energy is is a very interesting thing where there's obviously an enormous amount of demand

already right there's a lot of demand for energy there's a lot of demand for energy there's a lot of

trillions of dollars worth of energy demand but it's one of those things where if you make a lot

of it and you make it very cheap it creates its own demand sure and i don't think there's really

a limit to that like the more i play this out in my head if you can make energy cheaper you open up

these new apertures of places where you can sell it and things that you can do with it and so that

that really is like the fundamental motivation and the thing that we're trying to do here is that i

think energy should be 10 times cheaper than it is right now and you're right that's like a really

long-term vision uh but you have to be able to be super concrete and build stuff right now

six months 12 months at a time yeah so i mean the original vision still very cool i don't think it

doesn't sound like you're losing sight of it i don't think you should uh but the i mean we were

just talking to semi-analysis about the build out for ai data centers and it feels like energy is

the bottleneck the question of we will probably be able to scale up the gpu production

um but getting enough energy at the right price is probably going to be the next thing that we're

talking about all next year the year after and there's going to be this question of like where's

the energy coming from it's going to be a political issue if it's oil and gas maybe

there should be oil and gas in the short term but in the long term i think most people agree

nuclear and solar and so how are you thinking about the broader story here with america's

re-nuclearization uh there's a bunch of companies that are working on this what are the timelines

the key things that need to happen how's that looking yeah i think ai needs power in the next

couple years that's pretty obvious and you know i was at an event with tyler cowan and sam altman

a couple weeks ago and tyler asks him you know what's the only thing holding you back and he says

electrons yeah and tyler says anything else chips and he's like electrons right so that's pretty

clear then the follow-up question was what's the nearest term way to solve that in in sam's natural

gas and i would generally agree with that and i think that's probably true for the next 18 months

to make power for data centers in 2028 though and the interesting thing about nuclear is that i

believe it scales very differently to natural gas natural gas is very site specific you need to go

find good gas sources you're working on routing there's all these complicated things

nuclear you can kind of do wherever it makes sense and you can put a lot of it in one place

the reason for this is uranium is just easy to move around right kind of a year's worth of it

fits on a truck unlike a natural gas pipeline where you're working on the actual in-ground

logistics of moving gas around so i think once we've gotten that cracked like the first unit

that's making power we could just make more of them and you you end up seeing these big sites

that that people are sort of dreaming about today where you have a one two three gigawatt

you know ai data center this is very easily deliverable with the nuclear reactor that you

just mass produce right because you don't have to worry about these gas logistics yeah but how do

you decide like if we're doing one gigawatt that means we i mean the last thing we talked about was

getting 10 megawatts so you need a hundred of these things like why a hundred ten megawatts

as opposed to a thousand one megawatts or ten one hundred megawatts right like there's some trade-off

how'd you land there yeah so our unit will be a 25 megawatt electric 25 approximately yeah so that's

about 40 reactors per gigawatt and really the reason here is i i just think that in the west

in the western world we're really good at making bus size objects and if you try to make an object

bus you have a hard time yeah uh we used to be good at this right we used to be really good at

like large scale like hoover dam stop construction big nuclear reactors yeah spatial this kind of

stuff but if you notice how elon sort of revolutionized rockets he actually downsized

pretty significantly right the falcon 9 is a smaller rocket than you know any of the heavy

launch vehicles that took us to the moon and then he kind of slowly worked his way back up to starship

and even starship is like taking longer than you would have expected so there's just something about

the way that we do engineering that favors making objects smaller and making lots of them yeah so if

i'm there's a big part of like i just put it on a truck i talked to some early spacex people about

that and they're like you can put the engine on a truck once you go any bigger it's like get out the

crane every single time you want to do anything exactly and so if you can do just little less

crane work it just compounds and compounds and compounds what are what are the what are the

key risks to the business over the next like 24 months that you talk about internally with the

industry that you're trying to prove out i think somebody you know haters could have said you know

a year or so ago you can't build a nuclear reactor uh with 20 million dollars you you you d-rate you'll

need 153. you de-risk you de-risk from a capital from a capital standpoint now you're much less

capital constrained and you certainly doesn't feel like there's a lot of risk on the demand

side which is like if you can make cheap energy will people want this i think uh

we know the answer there uh but what are you what are you kind of like focused on internally

yeah that's exactly right and actually i think people are massively over focusing on every risk

except just the technical execution um you mentioned like there's a lot of demand right

i think you'll see a lot of companies put out mous they'll sign deals right you'll see you know this

company send deal with google this one's going to deal with amazon this sort of thing um one of my

actually biggest twitter haters i'm going to have to shout out unfortunately because he wrote such

i was like i saw this it's like damn it i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to shut that one out

uh my one of my big twitter haters nick turan shout out to you nick said

i'm issuing a universal mou to all nuclear companies me nick i'm saying i will buy 10

billion dollars of energy from any nuclear company that can actually build a nuclear reactor on time

and on budget and at a good price right so i think this is actually totally right like there is so

much demand and the thing that's missing is capability the thing that's missing is actually

the fact that we have to go back through r d and turn it on um and this is i think essentially

what sets valor apart from basically everybody else in nuclear today is that when we started the

company our our core conviction was that nuclear has to go back through r d again we sort of

assumed as an industry that because we've built many nuclear reactors in the past that we still

know how to and i think that's fundamentally wrong and this is sort of our belief from the

beginning that we have to go back through r d r d means starting small

starting low power building it very quickly testing it fast and that will lead us to a

commercial unit uh but there is just real tech risk along the past right you know pumps don't

work like you thought they would seals don't work like you know they don't hold as much pressure as

you thought and you iterate through it is the tech risk i mean it sounds like the test the

tech risk generally is a little bit overrated because this technology fundamentally like it

did work eight years ago it did work you know in the 60s i mean there were some problems in the

circuit yeah but even going to the moon is somewhat of a lost art yeah yeah i get it yeah

i would put this into the book it's not science risk it's it's tech risk right tech is really

about engineering and capital it's about what are your timelines yeah economics engineering capital

what are your timelines how much money do you have in resources to do it in the right timelines

and and that's why our focus has been small steps executed extremely quickly

i started this company about two years ago it's been about two years and two months since we

started the company. We built our first nuclear reactor within 14 months of founding the company,

and we're going to hopefully turn it on before the three-year mark. And if you can move at that

pace, I think you can sort of iterate your way. You get more shots on goal, right? Moving quickly

means you get lots of shots on goal. So if the seal doesn't work right exactly the first time

you do testing, that's fine because you have some time to go and test it and iterate that seal and

that valve. Are you moving the family out to Utah yet? Are we going to see a Valor kind of like

planned development with a bunch of mid-century homes set up? I will say we do have more RVs than

I expected at the site right now and a lot more on order as well. Yeah, the housing out here in

the desert is going to be an interesting challenge to solve. We're not just building the reactor

building here. We also have a Triso fuel plant that's going up as well. So we're actually going

to be making our own Triso fuel. So yeah, we're going to have a really fun operation out here.

And that's only the beginning. Very cool. Very cool. Congratulations on the progress in the

round. Fantastic. I'm super excited for you and the whole team. Yeah. Awesome. Awesome group of

investors too. I have to shout out Doug Philippone who led this round, ran Global Defense Palantir

for I think 17 years, started Snowpoint, ex-Army Ranger, JSOC Commander. Awesome, awesome guy.

Not in this photo, but I actually arrived on our site here for the groundbreaking in a Blackhawk

helicopter. No way.

Doug, which was fantastic. It's a great time. The suit in the Blackhawk goes unbelievably hard.

Goes quite hard. It's fantastic.

Pedram Sharaf and Richard Blankenship as well from Dream absolutely made the magic happen on

this round too. Fantastic guys. Really, really grateful for all our investors.

And Palmer's in. I remember the last time me, you, and Palmer were together, you guys were in a

fierce debate and you clearly got, you wound up seeing eye to eye because now he's in the round,

so congratulations on that.

Yeah, yeah. I think we were debating about how much uranium we have. There's lots of it, guys.

We've got a lot of uranium to use. Yeah. I mean, someday we'll get to fusion, but not before we're

all living in like O'Neill cylinders with more energy than we know what to do with.

Fantastic. Well, I'm very excited for our nuclear future. I'm excited for what you're building. And

I just want to say massive congrats. I remember we filmed a very brief interview in El Segundo,

probably around two years ago. You didn't even have an office yet. And it's been, what a fantastic

run. Congratulations on all the progress. Amazing stuff.

Awesome. Thanks, John and Jordy. Have a great one.

We'll talk to you soon. Cheers, dude.

No, this is Hayden. We got Hayden first.

Oh, fantastic. This was the last minute ad, I guess.

Hayden, welcome to the show. Squeezing in.

Hey, how are you doing?

Super excited to have you on the show here. We have, as you know, a Uniswap alum working on the

team. We're very, very grateful to have him. And it's great to meet you.

Yeah, great to meet you both.

I actually wasn't planning on doing anything today, but now here I am.

There you go.

Yeah, great to be here.

Awesome. For anybody that has been living under a data center, introduce yourself and Uniswap.

Yeah, so I'm Hayden. I'm the founder and CEO at Uniswap Labs.

Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange in the world. So for some context,

if you annualize the past couple of months of volume, it does about $2 trillion a year in trade

setting. When you think about what a decentralized exchange is, you could think of us as a YouTube to

a Coinbase, or Binance as Netflix, so we have the upload function. So people can create their own

markets. We've introduced this whole system called automated market making, which lets people create

liquidity themselves. And so it sort of dramatically lowers the cost to the creation and

access of financial markets. And we're one of the pioneers of what people call decentralized finance.

which is this area of crypto that is focused on building decentralized, transparent financial infrastructure.

And so, you know, Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange in that industry.

Amazing. So we were live when your post hit the timeline.

We have it pulled up now, but it would be awesome for you to kind of run us through kind of the news and break it down for us.

Yeah, and I can try to, you know, set some context here.

So there's kind of a bunch of different things here.

So Uniswap launched about eight years ago or seven years ago, and maybe about five years ago, we launched this thing called the UniToken,

which was a token that was meant to govern the Uniswap ecosystem.

And within that, well, at a high level, what the protocol does is it introduces an economic system for the Uniswap protocol and the UniToken.

And then it also basically refocuses Uniswap Labs on building value and building on top of the Uniswap protocol.

So, you know.

We're kind of in this like moment in time where there's a bunch of different things happening in crypto.

And part of what we're seeing is a lot of people almost like move crypto into traditional financial rails and part of what, you know, they're sort of like almost trying to IPO crypto companies or build these treasury companies.

And what we're focusing on is doubling and tripling down on the technology itself and the, you know, the decentralized protocol that we built.

And so, you know, the proposal first, it turns on protocol fees.

This has been a really big thing in the Uniswap world for a very long time.

People have kind of wondered when this would happen, but here, you know, so the protocol fees will be turned on and these are fees for trading on Uniswap protocol, as well as there's this chain that we built called Unichain, and those fees are also going to this Uniburn system.

There's also a essentially a burn of a large amount of Uni from the Treasury.

And this is basically representing all the fees that could have been.

It's almost like symbolic.

There's been sort of a lot of like, you know, speculation around when this would happen.

And so I think that, you know, this is kind of like a nod to that.

And then beyond that, you know, Uniswap.

So one thing to kind of, like, give context here is that we were in this like crazy regulation by enforcement area for crypto.

Essentially, you know, Gary Gensler and the SEC sort of sued basically everyone in the who lived in the US who was a crypto founder.

And, you know, the kind of incentives that created for the ecosystem, basically, they said, if you do anything that builds value for our

community.

we're going to sue you and then actually and then you know within that context we were extremely

like limited in how we could interact um with with the world and then you know we basically

and then they sued us anyway and then we you know and then it was ultimately ultimately dropped but

i think so what's happening now is that there's sort of like a very different kind of uh thing

here and so you know uniswap labs is really able to kind of lean into the uh the uniswap protocol

and building for it and focusing its full kind of attention to that uh where we spent a lot of the

past few years focused on basically building a business around the products that we build on top

of the protocol um so there's like this decentralized network kind of like bitcoin and then there's uh

these apps and websites uh kind of like you know a bitcoin wallet or an exchange built on top of

bitcoin and so we've built uh these products on top of the uniswap protocol and they have

tens of millions of users and so we've been kind of very focused at uniswap labs on building a

business around that um but you know with this proposal i think what what we're kind of

acknowledging and what we're we're saying is that the the really big opportunity here

much like the you know the biggest opportunity of bitcoin is the bitcoin network not each little

application at the top the big opportunity here is the uniswap protocol and we want you know as

the sort of inventors of of this protocol and and people who've been developing for a long time we

want to make that our core focus so we're like you know leaning into that and kind of uh making that

our full attention moving forward what uh what does this mean for uh equity holders and uniswap

labs the company that that raised venture capital because i think part of what came out of the

uh gary gensler era was you had this kind of like bifurcation of value where there was equity

holders that got access to tokens and so they had upside there and it's all it felt like uh

not not the kind of scenario that we'd see let's say in 15 years from now when tokenization is

is kind of the norm and this is a standard way to build companies and distribute value but

i'm curious what the what the proposal means for uh

that kind of setup yeah and it's a very perverse incentive to say you know if you do anything that

creates value that's the bad thing to do versus um and that's sort of how you end up with this

kind of like thing where the only thing that was popular in crypto for a very long time was meme

coins um and it was because they were you know they were the only thing that you could say well

no one is trying to build any value and so that's what became popular in crypto and that's not really

like what is exciting to me right what's exciting to me is the idea of these like truly decentralized

networks that create value um and i think that for me you know

what i want to align you know my work to doing is what i think creates the most value in the world

and i think for for uniswap labs the way that we think we can create the most value in the world

is to lean into building this protocol um so part of this proposal does include a a kind of a

service provider relationship between us and and the the dow um that sort of aligns our you know

our our kind of uh mutual kind of or like that sort of like aligns our upside and so you know in

this proposal if um if we create a lot of value then then we can kind of um you know realize that

some of that so the goal here is to really like align incentives and do you think do you think

more crypto companies that uh raised from traditional financial institutions will

try to pursue these more aligned models going forward look i i hope so i think that you know

everyone was sort of kind of dealing with what was possible and um and i think that people have

kind of still like evolved and adapted and you know a lot of you know i think that uh but my

hope is that like the the crypto native things are what ultimately win and i think that's kind of

where i put my kind of bets uh to me you know like the point of the technology is is the is

the like the point of the industry is the technology um it's like the decentralization

it's the idea that you can create you know a financial application that uh you trust not

because you trust a company but because the the code is is transparent and public and auditable

and run by multiple independent parties right this idea of like decentralized consensus and networks

it can be really powerful and so i think that the more that uh you know projects lean into that um

the better off we are there's sort of like this interesting uh thing that happens um

like all of the all of the feet for example the fee system that we're sort of proposing as part

of this uh every aspect of it is is transparent and public and auditable and verifiable in real

time and so people don't need you know quarterly reports from a company when you can have you know

real-time access to anyone in the world that's like not just like public and transparent but

also like cryptographically provable and so you know there's sort of like different ways

of accomplishing a lot of the goals that various regulations have when

you sort of um kind of like uh lean into the the unique nature of the technology that makes a lot

of sense how's the reaction been uh we've been we've been streaming here so i haven't been able

to check the timeline but this seems like something that uh both you know uniswap super fans

and and uh you know detractors would uh appreciate yeah so it's only been about an hour and a half

you guys were fast to messaging me um but so far i mean from what i've seen it has been extremely

uh from a from a public reaction uh every everyone on twitter seems very happy um which is where

most of crypto conversation happens i guess it's it's x i i still say twitter it's hard it's hard

not to it's hard still happens to me every now and then uh well congratulations big big milestone

and feels like it's a really positive we have one follow-up industry here uh do you think this is

gonna be a trend for other companies that are in a similar situation yeah i i hope so we're doing it

best in the way you know we think leaning into you know the centralization and the decentralized

protocol is what's best yeah um and so i i hope that you know other people follow this trend as

well um you know i i think that a lot of people have been doing it but they've mostly been doing

it from like outside the us or in all these different ways that um and i think that like

ultimately we really believe that this is like the right thing and that what is sort of best

for users and what's best you know world which is why we're doing it what about on the regulation

side is there anything to touch on there uh yeah i would just be

curious uh with uh are are maybe the the the version of you that's earlier in their in their

career are they deciding to set up in the united states i mean i know you went through absolute

hell for a number of years and and uh being you know uh based in new york was was a big challenge

but are you seeing more younger crypto builders decide hey it's actually makes sense for me to

set up in in you know a place like new york one of the financial capitals of the world

are you still seeing a lot of stuff happening offshore because people don't think it's worth

uh the risk of potentially a new admin taking a different stance on crypto yeah so i think you

know for the past four years it was a lot of people moving outside the us and that was sort

of the predominant advice that people got um and then what we've seen in maybe the past year is

people start to come back to the us and i have various friends who've kind of moved their offices

and uh who run crypto companies who've kind of moved to new york so we're definitely starting

in a crypto hub a forum in new york uh brooklyn brooklyn it's actually it's actually particularly

in soho i'd say um but there are the brooklyn hub but there's kind of a growing uh soho hub

uh to crypto and i personally i love i love it here um you know there's like i could say that

it was because i believed in the technology and that it would sort of you know that being on the

right side of history would ultimately prevail but i will also say that i just love it here as well

and i love living in new york so i definitely hope more people come here um in terms of like

really where like this like market structure bill that's um that's being kind of discussed in um in

congress is kind of pretty important as is um the you know some of the like you know what we expect

would be upcoming regulations out of various regulators and so you know the hope is to have

like additional clarity and uh clarity that makes sense with the technology um that's really

important right um i think that was what was challenging before is sort of regulators taking

stances that just didn't make sense for the technology um yeah uh and and so uh you know

the hope is that the the sort of environment kind of can like and we really you know the hope is that

long term there isn't this sort of like um it's like not a doesn't you know it doesn't kind of

stay a politicized topic long term and the hope is that really it's just like people create you know

there's sensible regulations that come out of uh congress that sort of um and again like recognize

that that you know the the software developers that create decentralized protocols are very

different from you know a centralized financial institution that custodies funds all right those

are just like fundamentally different things and so

uh the hope is to have that kind of really recognized and acknowledged at a at a federal

scale um and once that happens i think it will be like even more um you know of a slam dunk soho

soho crypto renaissance era will really will really begin uh well uh great great to meet you

thanks for coming on and uh congratulations on on all the progress and the proposal and uh we'll

have to have you back on again soon yeah excited to come back on sometime awesome great to hang

cheers uh let me tell you about wander

find your happy place book a wander with inspiring views hotel graded minis dreamy beds top tier

cleaning and i am in a wonder right now vacation home but better it's geordie's so i uh i will share

one fun anecdote they knew i had uh kids i didn't communicate with uh with the the wander team at

all just booked it um and uh and they they knew i had kids because they asked for that info on

the way and they bought a bunch of toys oh no there was toys when i arrived for the kids um

uh and that made bedtime a challenge because it was like it looked like uh christmas morning out

there but without further ado we have the ceo of gamma coming in welcome to the show welcome to the

show sorry so sorry to keep you waiting crazy day guys uh but we're we're pumped to have you on

and uh talk about the news yeah it's so great to be here guys uh excited to share we uh just

closed the series b from andreessen at a 2.1 billion dollar evaluation

there's some other info too you're you're uh you're profitable too right is that right

we we are profitable we've been profitable for two years two years and we uh so we we passed

100 million in ar all with a team of 50. 50 team of 50. that's incredible insane what what makes

gamma why is it working so well yeah because we've seen some every you know this was a category that

i think a lot of people were excited about

A couple of years ago, we saw a ton of investment going into making decks, specifically presentations

with generative AI.

Not everything is panned out, but it seems to be working incredibly well for you guys.

What's the secret sauce?

We attribute a lot of it to actually getting started well before this recent AI wave.

We've been a company for five years now.

The first couple of years, we actually focused a lot on just the underlying editing experience.

Can we create new building blocks that aren't traditional slides, the 16 by 9 format, and

allow the average person, the everyday person that isn't a designer, doesn't have design

skills to create much faster?

Two and a half years ago, we married those building blocks with just re-engineering the

entire workflow within Gamma so that AI can actually really quickly assemble those building

blocks.

Fast, give the end user a really seamless experience.

How can you talk about the shape of the user?

Have you been selling direct to consumers, B2B?

Is there some sort of like Dropbox did the viral web, the consumer software viral loop

where I send it to you, you install, you become a customer, we upsell?

Or is it more SDR-led?

How are you thinking about the actual growth engine for the business?

Yeah, definitely.

Where we started, we actually started much more of a prosumer base of users.

You can imagine anybody that has to do a lot of external-facing communication, whether

a freelancer, a solopreneur, a small business owner, someone that needs to create a lot

of decks, we made it dead simple for them to get started.

For them, the beauty is that they're not locked into the Microsoft suite, the G Suite, so

they have the freedom to choose whatever tool they want.

They have the freedom to choose whatever tool is best for the job.

They're able to pick up our tool, use it.

By nature of our category, we're lucky that if you like using Gamma, you're sharing and

presenting with others.

There's organic virality baked into the use of the product.

As the product has gotten better, more and more people use it, share it, share it in

many different ways, and that allows us to essentially acquire more and more users for

extremely cheap.

How big is the market for decks?

Yeah.

I feel like it's hard for me to get a sense of how big the market is for actual infrastructure

for creating decks, software for creating decks.

Obviously, the market for decks is in the hundreds of billions, I'm sure, if you add

up all the different consulting groups and things like that, but yeah, how do you look

at that market?

You're multi-product now, but yeah, do you expect that decks will be something, one of

the biggest products?

Do you expect to see the product line in five years, 10 years, or do you guys really want

to go wide?

Well, yeah.

Even if we just start with the category presentations, to your point, it's massive, right?

Google Slides, 800 million monthly active users, and then you add PowerPoint.

We're talking well over a billion monthly active users, and that's just in that one

category.

Wait, PowerPoint has a billion monthly actives?

That's insane.

Well, you add Google Slides and PowerPoint together.

We're talking about a category where, today, we're talking about a category where we're

talking about a product that's still pretty manual and tedious to use.

Now imagine Gamma automating a ton.

Our API is going to actually make it so that anybody can actually build on top of our platform

as well.

If you have a business where content creation can be core to your infrastructure, you can

now build on top of Gamma, so no longer even manually creating content.

It's going to be a massive market.

So that API business, is that another SaaS company that wants to make it easy?

Is it going to be easy to generate reports that users can walk people through the organization?

Oh, that's a good one.

Yeah, yeah.

Is that kind of a use case?

It's like, hey, take your data.

We'll turn it into a beautiful presentation automatically that you can run a meeting with?

So there's actually multiple different layers.

Layer one I'll call just an extension of our prosumer business today.

So imagine if you're already using Zapier, you can combine that with your favorite tools.

So Granola for Notes, for instance.

If you're a freelancer, you take all your notes in Granola.

The moment the meeting's over, you can take that meeting transcript, feed it into Gamma,

and create a very personalized deck going back to your client saying, hey, these are

all the things we discussed.

These are deliverables.

These are the action items we agreed on.

You get a beautiful PDF sent directly to them right after.

So that's like a prosumer use case.

Then there's B2B use cases where, in the future, we'll partner with platforms like Glean, where

Glean is sitting on top of company knowledge.

If anybody internally wants to create a QBR.

or strategy deck, they can pull that into Gamma, automate the content creation, create

a beautiful deck so that you can use that for a meeting or discussion.

And then one of the use cases you alluded to is what if other developers can build on

top of Gamma?

So imagine you have like a real estate app.

Your real estate app, you want to empower your users.

Any time they look up a listing or look up a zip code, they want a PDF of all the different

listings in that zip code.

Well, we can power all that content creation, build a beautiful report.

So that app company focuses on the app itself, not on the content infrastructure.

We can essentially operate in the background, send that beautiful PDF with all the listings

for that particular zip code to the end user for that particular app.

Are you going to keep the team lean going forward?

Are you going to develop some hubris and hire like 400 people?

What's the plan?

DocuSign numbers.

Get to the DocuSign numbers.

Yeah.

You know, we've always tried to do things maybe a little bit different.

We raise as little as we can.

Yeah.

We're still a super lean team.

We continue, you know, I think we're going to continue to do that no matter what.

And so lean is obviously, you know, relative to, you know, we have big ambitions.

And so the team is going to get bigger.

We're definitely hiring.

But relative to our traction, I think we're still going to be pretty small.

Did you ever think about raising 67 million?

You know, it's a good question.

We felt like we really needed that extra million just in case.

Missed opportunity for the meme potential.

Yeah.

Somebody else has to do that.

Well, awesome.

Crazy, crazy, crazy progress.

And I love to see, you know, a winner coming out of this category.

You know, everybody has been through the pain of making presentations.

And there were so many, you know, I'm thinking of Tome, I think there was, and there was

Pitch.com, all these companies that tried to crack this problem and just didn't quite

figure it out.

Ed Norton has a company.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Ed, you're competing with Ed Norton too.

We got competition from everywhere, you know?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's something to break into.

Yeah.

Something's working.

Well, great to meet you.

Congratulations.

And I'm sure we'll see you on here for, this was, was this series A or B?

Series B.

Series B. Okay.

We'll see you on here for the C. Looking forward to it.

Sounds great.

Thanks so much, guys.

Great to meet you.

Fantastic.

We'll see you soon.

Let me tell you about Bezel.

Your Bezel concierge is available now.

Source you any watch on the planet.

Seriously.

Any watch.

Buco Capital bloke said, I just don't see a world where corporate budgets for AI will

be smaller in 2026 than they were in 2025.

I think they will be much bigger.

Got room to run, baby.

Somebody commented, then you're out of touch with the world and stuck in a home office.

But you said that.

Buco says, that doesn't even make sense.

That doesn't make sense, of course, because if you're in the home office, you wouldn't

understand.

No.

Yeah.

That's very confusing.

Alex Cohen says, if a startup requires you to be in office 12 hours a day, six days a

week, you should run the F away like your life depends on it.

Apparently this company Giga, which has been going viral, what is, are they actually saying

that you need to be in the office 12 days a week?

Or sorry, 12 hours a day.

Someone said that they got hired in April to lead demand gen for them.

They quit after the first day.

There were red flags.

We hit 10 million ARR.

We're going to spend 100K on blank illegal stuff.

We're doing blank in MRR.

The dashboards in the headquarters showed 6X less.

In office seven days a week, 12 hours a day, PTO policy is subject to change, blah, blah,

blah.

You are expected to always be working.

Gave an offer letter on Wednesday.

So sort of like-

They chopped off a goat's head in India because it brings good luck.

Allegedly.

Sounds aggressive.

I wonder, have they responded?

Has Giga responded to this?

Has Giga responded to this and said like, this is not real?

Because that would be important, I guess, if they have to, because somebody's like making

this claim about them.

It should be sort of like, you know, debated because we don't know when someone, when someone

makes a claim like this, there's a bunch of different motivations that could be behind

it.

I don't know.

Hopefully, I saw Giga did an interview with Harsh Tagar from YC and they seem to be getting

some traction in their market.

It seems to be some good stuff.

I mean, there's nothing wrong, like each one of these needs to be like kind of evaluated

in and of itself.

There's nothing particularly wrong with working very hard if everyone's in on it and everyone's

happy with it.

So we'll see.

We'll stay tuned for the response from the Giga.

Yashan says, my AI investment thesis is that every AI application startup is likely to

be crushed by rapid expansion of the foundational model providers.

He's still bearish on the application layer.

That's interesting.

That was a take from like a year or two ago that had kind of got out of fashion.

What do you think, Tyler?

Well, yeah.

So one thing, so Elon quoted it and says, seems to be accurate.

But one thing that's kind of interesting here, Sam Altman with Tyler Cowen, they were talking

about like an AI native Slack and a lot of people were saying like, request for startup,

like who's building this?

And it's like, you have to assume that Sam is going to, like he runs his business on

Slack.

He cares a lot about, yeah, he cares a lot about enterprise.

He wants ChatGPT to be an agent that's working in your company 24 seven.

You think he's just going to be like, oh yeah, someone else should build that.

I don't care about the enterprise.

Someone else should build the AI native Slack.

Yeah, I don't know.

I would just assume that he's building that.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

We'll see.

What do you think?

Is there still value in the application layer or are you so AGI pilled that it doesn't matter?

Just hoard electrons.

Yeah.

I mean, yeah, this was like the original, like, um, like rapper was like a slur almost.

It's like, oh, you're starting a rapper company.

Like it's like totally fake thing.

Yeah.

Um, but I think that the kind of rapper trade has done very well.

Oh, totally.

It's done super well.

So yeah.

I mean, like look at Giga, they're pro or, uh, not Giga, but Gamma, they're, they're

profitable.

A hundred mil ARR.

Uh, yeah.

I think people massively overestimate how much, like how many different things that,

uh, these foundation model companies can actually do.

Yeah.

Well, you just can't allocate that many engineers, like so many different products.

I disagree.

It's not that it's, it's the capabilities of the fundamental underlying model, because

there is a world where you go to the, the, just the base weights of GPT 10 and you say,

generate me a 10 slide deck that pitches my product to this customer and it just generates

it all.

It just does it all.

And the tokens that it is outputting are essentially PPT and it generates UI on the

fly that allows you to edit the output because even, even the most, even the smartest designers,

best designers I've ever worked with, rarely are they just one shotting a task where I'm

like, no more, you know, you want to get in there and like switch it up yourself.

Right.

Uh, yeah.

But like, so look at cloud code.

Cloud code is just, I mean, it's just a base model with some scaffolding, right.

Yeah.

You can have it as like the actual capabilities of the model aren't incredible, but if you

add, uh, basically, you know, essentially a really nice four loop, it gets way better.

Um, that's just like extra engineers that are just like normal software engineers.

Sure.

Um, you could see that Anthropic do the same thing where they bring, you know, they, they

put a group of 10 engineers and they say, make this better at building PowerPoints.

Yes.

They don't do that.

No, no, no.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No, I, I agree with that.

Like, like, but, uh, there was a scenario where.

Cloud code would be the cloud code for PowerPoint because you can go to cloud code and tell

it, Hey, iterate on the four loop generating PowerPoint.

Yeah.

I think that's still not so crazy.

Like you've talked about this thing where you, you use cloud code to do like a research

and it made a nice HTML file.

That's a PDF.

That's, you know, use that.

You could just PDF it at the end of it.

It's a word doc.

Yeah.

You know, so there is, there is a world where like, yeah, the application layer still, uh,

still, you know, faces significant competition from the foundation model labs.

Let's read Ishan's, uh, uh, he's also the, uh, former CEO of Reddit, correct?

Yes.

I'll be right back.

Uh, so Ishan says my AI investment thesis is that every AI application startup is likely

to be crushed by rapid expansion of the foundational model providers app functionality will be

added to the foundational models offerings, uh, because the big players aren't slow incumbents.

It is wrong to apply the analogy of.

We have fast startup, slow incumbent here.

They are just big for far more, uh, far more so than with any other new, uh, prior new

technology.

There is a massive and fast moving wave that obsoletes every new app is almost, almost

as fast as it can be invented.

There's almost no time to build a company and scale it.

There are two ways AI application startup founders can make money, make a flash in the

pan app that generates a ton of cash and bank the cash.

My estimate is that you have about, uh, 12 to 18 months cashflow generation.

Uh, make a good enough app that you get acquired by one of the big players for sufficient equity.

Uh, the situation is highly unstable.

We don't know if it's going to crash or go to the moon, but both scenarios make it very

unlikely that any AI application startup will independently become a generational super

company.

Baseline odds are low to begin with.

I sort of agree with that.

That makes sense.

Uh, the best odds are finding an application niche in a highly specialized field with extremely

unique and specific data barriers.

Ideally.

I think the best option is to start with a company that is really into real atoms, hardware

or world related, uh, data and not software slash finance.

Interesting.

Yeah.

I mean, I, I think, um, like if you're a normal kind of consumer rapper company, you probably

did not like seeing what open AI was doing the summer where they had, oh, we have a Expedia

plugin and now it's, you can use, you know, Figma, you can use it straight in the, in

the, you know, um, I think there, there are still plenty of startups that like are quietly

just like dying.

Yeah.

From better models or just more like productized, you know, features in the actual chat interface

or whatever.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I do wonder about the shape of that curve because it's like, it's clear that like open

AI used to just be such a monolith in the sense that it was just like train bigger transformer,

train bigger transformer.

That's what open AI is.

At least that was like the, the view from the outside.

And then it became like, okay, uh, chat GPT, the app, but then also like enterprise stuff

and then also API.

Yeah.

Also Sora and also Dolly and, and at one point, do you remember, do you remember the Dolly

UI?

Do you remember there was like, there was a moment where Dolly was turning into like

Photoshop in the browser and you could actually like edit and highlight different regions

and you could do like in painting where you could say, generate an image here and then

generate an image next to it, generate an image, you can kind of block it all together.

And they were like building an application on top of the image model.

And I don't know if that disappeared.

I, maybe we just don't talk about it anymore.

Uh, maybe, maybe they're still working on it, but there were a number of different,

I imagine that they have a vid, uh, like a, a visualization of different SAS categories

that they could potentially go after.

Just like Google did with, you know, on-prem software, like what's not in the cloud.

Well, email's not in the cloud.

Well, PowerPoint's not in the cloud.

Well, Google slides, uh, you know, spreadsheets aren't in the cloud instead of Excel.

Let's go to Google sheets.

And then, and Google just kind of chopped down that.

Yeah.

And so OpenAI could be doing something very similar, uh, looking at like, what's not AI-ified,

what's not AI-native.

Yeah.

I, I think, uh, it's definitely wrong to say that this like question of whether wrappers

are like long-term valuable, I think it's like very much still an OpenAI question.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It'll be interesting to see.

Um, there will definitely be some folks who get out early.

There's be some folks that figure out ways to, to be durable.

It'll probably be a mixed bag.

Uh.

Yeah.

I think Google says the strategy Ponzi scheme is blowing up.

They have $689 million of interest due in 2026 that they don't have.

Saylor is enticing investors by raising yield by a 25 basis points to 10 and a half percent

on preferred shares to raise capital to keep running the Ponzi.

Wow.

Collateral deflates in value.

Uh, so they currently have about 50 million of cash on hand in order to pay that interest,

so it can raise more debt.

more debt at this you know relatively high rate 10 and a half percent they currently have about

eight and a half 8.2 billion of debt the market value of their bitcoin is roughly 65 billion

and the company is sitting at a 68 uh billion dollar market cap is down 40 in the past uh six

months and so we will so wait so it's so strategy is now trading at book value essentially is that

right it's trading at 68 billion but they have 80 bill 8 billion of debt okay okay and so so net of

debt they're still a little bit high a little bit above where asset value is interesting um

apparently so this is in the wall street journal too i guess uh everyone's writing about this right

now but um the stimmy check's coming back yeah

uh the tariff dividend some members of the team are excited about it excited for the stimulus

checks everyone's pumped um yeah i mean the the original microstrategy trade was like it was hard

to buy crypto in on certain platforms it was hard to buy uh it was hard to buy crypto in your ira

and microstrategy gave folks a way to do that um and it still exists there is some sort of arbitrage

still but uh just so you're really getting access to bitcoin is guess what day microstrategy peaked

in uh in the dot-com bubble wait what oh dot-com oh they've been around that long that's yeah so

the criticism of sailor is that like he was like uh he was a it was a a kind of a bub guy sure he's

big into that whole world and the bull case he seems relentless he's still around relentless

uh he the the stock peaked march 10th of 2000. wow

um there you go march 10th 2000. so microstrategy was worth about 128 billion at its peak in july

it is now worth about 70 billion so uh i mean a pretty significant sell-off uh and interestingly

bitcoin has not sold off in the same way it's purely the the market mood changing around

crypto treasury companies apparently very very fascinating um there's yeah there's a lot here um

but we can go into it some other time uh anything else in the timeline geordie that we should be

looking at we are well well over we're in the fourth hour baby we're well we're in the fifth

hour and we're in the fifth hour we're in the let's go for six let's go for six in the fourth

hour i start asking our guests the same questions that jordy asks that just gets so lost it happens

it's like a million text messages uh anyway stimulus checks are back this is true apparently

at least it's like rumored or it's at least it's truth it's on it's not necessarily true yet but

it's on truth social so uh warren buffett will be paying a terrorist tariff dividend of two thousand

a letter that says he's i'm going quiet what warren buffett says he's going quiet he says in

one of uh this is the times today he says in one of the his final missives as a company's leader

mr buffett said he would accelerate his plans to disperse his fortune to his children's foundations

on the path of assimilation and the welfare of their children and also the old age and the

lives of their younger children you know you know it's it's it's a very uh unique thing

uh to see how those kids of olden are now at their prime and respect to experience and wisdom but

have yet to enter old age uh who he's talking about his daughter and two sons who range in age

from 67 to 72 um and uh again another still sitting on a lot of cash he's got a lot of cash the

post from andrew reed says the top real estate agent in hillsborough burlington is this guy

named stanley lowe and on his website he says the diminutive risk taker speaks with competitiveness

cockiness and conviction of a salesman who loves the business and rarely doubts his ability to

succeed against all comers and all odds while some will attempt to impugn the green banker

operation as a high-end real estate machine those who have transacted with the firm see

it for what it is a successful responsive juggernaut that reflects the personal

personality and determ determination and discipline of one man stanley lowe and the

perpetual motion of a real estate operation that never slackens in its quest to stay atop the real

estate pyramid what what a bar what a bar good and look at this guy he's suited up looking like

an absolute g he's actually the top you got to work on getting stanley on this show that's not
