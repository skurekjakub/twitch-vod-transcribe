You're watching TBPN.

Today is Monday, November 10, 2025.

We are live from the TBPN Ultradome.

The temple of technology, the fortress of finance,

the capital is capital.

The capital is capital.

What are you saying?

The capital of capital.

The capital of capital.

The capital is capital.

We have a good show for you today, folks.

The market is up.

The market is up, so I'm in a white suit.

Jordy, why aren't you in a suit?

So I moved into a Wander last night,

moved into a Wander last night, doing some work on the house.

And I botched the packing.

So I am forced into this jacket, despite it being green out

there today.

That happens.

Well, over the weekend, I'm sure everyone

was signing up for ramp.com.

Time is money.

Say both.

Easy to use corporate cards, bill payments,

accounting, and a whole lot more all in one place.

No, everyone was probably glued to their phones over at Pope

Gate.

Pope Gate, the debate over the pope.

We reacted to the pope's post on Friday.

Yeah.

It was a great post.

It was a great post.

And the pope, he's a poster.

I like it.

He posts almost every day, sometimes like up

to five times a day.

And he really takes you, he's not stuck in one lane.

He's got range.

Yeah, he's got range.

He's got range.

That's right.

He'll tell you about, he'll pray for if there's

a natural disaster, he'll pray for that.

He talks about business, talks about AI, talks about media.

He talks about all sorts of stuff.

It's a really great feat.

He had a great post about it.

He had a great post about media.

What did he say about media?

He said, the media cannot and must not separate itself

from the destiny of truth.

That hits.

Does this mean he's a neo-factual media guy?

I think so.

I think he's one of us.

Transparency of sources and ownership,

accountability, quality, clarity, and objectivity

are the keys to truly opening citizens' rights

for all peoples.

Wow.

Makes sense.

I like it a lot.

He also was just talking about business generally.

He said, the world needs honest and courageous entrepreneurs

and communicators who care for the common good.

We sometimes hear the saying, business is business.

In reality, it is not so.

No one is absorbed by an organization

to the point of becoming a mere cog or a simple function,

nor can there be true humanism without a critical sense,

without the courage to ask questions, where are we going?

For whom and for what are we working?

How are we making the world a better place?

This is the type of stuff you'd see on a Pinterest board.

It's pretty generic, but it's hard to disagree with.

It's hard to disagree with.

But it seemed like, I'm not exactly sure what happened,

but it seemed like Marc Andreessen was disagreeing

with one of the pope's takes about AI.

Specifically, in this post, the pope said,

technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine.

The divine act of creation, it carries an ethical and spiritual weight

for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity.

The church therefore calls on all builders of AI

to cultivate moral discernment

as a fundamental part of their work,

to develop systems that reflect justice, solidarity,

and genuine reverence for life.

And when we reacted to this, we thought it was pretty good.

We were joking around, we were having fun.

We were laughing about it

and just kind of playing out, what if the pope was one-shotted by AI?

Or what if he was using too many em dashes?

Was it a real post?

Using AI to write the post.

I mean, you might even assume that he has a team behind this stuff.

I think it is generally healthy that the pope is going to comment

and provide some sort of guidance or his own framework

for how we should think about developing AI.

That seems healthy.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Any налогао

For interviewing Sidney Sweeney.

And people were actually kind of familiar

of confused on what that particular meme means in this context, uh, was correct.

Yeah.

Do you know, uh, so I, I saw, so yeah, that, that was the part, part of what I

think, uh, may have catalyzed this was that new meme template that, uh, sometimes.

Like you have to, with, with a meme template, there's two ways to read into it.

There's like the, the, the actual visual, which is like, what is the

expression of the person's face, right?

You don't have to have watched the big short to understand if I'm somebody's

staring at the screen, just like confused, you're just saying I'm confused by this.

Yeah.

So Michael Burry in the big short, just looking confused at a screen, right.

And, and it, and it has sort of a, uh, obviously more meaning to that.

If you've seen the movie and you understand the full context, but

somebody who doesn't have to know the context now, so this scene out of the GQ

interview, how do you think people pick the frame?

Do you think there's.

People that go frame by frame to find the one that they think is iconic.

So I, you remember that movie mountain gate that was about like the development

of AI and I, I watched that movie within an hour, it was a huge moment for me.

Cause it was the third movie you've ever seen.

Yeah.

You were, I was blown away and you were thrilled.

I watched, you watched the movie, but because it was something that was

notable to me out of that is I was the first person to post a picture of, of, um,

the guy from the office saying.

Like he's a D cell, he's this or that you found that I posted that picture.

And then I watched as that got used thousands of times, even though, even

though, yeah, that specific screenshot, I didn't create the meme.

It would have, it would have been, it would have been like a meme anyways, but.

The specific picture I took was copied over and over and over.

And you took that from the actual movie because, because somebody else could have

done one frame earlier, one frame later, but it happened to be your frame.

The funny thing is I just took a picture of my TV and like cropped it.

Wait, really?

So it wasn't like,

you didn't even screenshot it.

No, that's insane.

I had no idea that you, so I was surprised.

Like that was just, yeah.

Yeah.

No, if you, if you had, if you hadn't watched the movie, if you got busy and

you just went to bed, somebody else would have identified that and been like, oh,

he's a D cell, like I got to put that on X.

Right.

But you're the actual quote was like, he's a D cell with a crazy P dude.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Of course you're going to post that.

That's hilarious.

Wow.

That's fascinating.

Okay.

Anyway.

So what was your interpretation of what, what, what Mark was saying, uh, the way

I, the way I summed it up and let me know if you disagree, but the way I, the

way I summed up was, uh, most of the timeline interpreted Mark's post as the

Pope is scolding AI builders and shouldn't be, is that roughly the way you, you

interpreted it, the Pope, like, like you put the, you put the woman, I wasn't

interpreting.

I wasn't interpreting many of Mark's posts because he just used it like 20

times and so I wasn't reading.

I think he just.

Yeah.

Like the format and got a little carried away.

He did.

He did like the format.

He posted like five times.

Um, it was, it was clearly, it was clearly, uh, a hit.

It's like, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a powerful image.

Ride your winners, baby.

Ride your winners.

When you, when you have a good format, just post it.

Uh, yeah.

But anyway, I, I don't know my, my, I, I think a lot of the timeline

interpreted as like the Pope is, is saying is like scolding AI builders.

And there's been this other, there's, there was another like kind of

low grade rumble on the timeline about, uh, like Brad Gerstner's comments

about like D cells and, and, and just like this, this idea that D cell or

safety is being used as like a cudgel, uh, when people have legitimate questions.

And it's being used to like, to like shut down conversation about serious

things, not necessarily a sci-fi fast takeoff terminator, but serious,

serious questions like, you know.
