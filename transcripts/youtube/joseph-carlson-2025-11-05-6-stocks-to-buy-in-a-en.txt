Welcome back everyone. Today on the
Joseph Carlson show, we know the
market's getting a little bullish. We're
seeing it in all the evidence. We can
see it in the pricing of stocks alone.
The forward price to earnings ratio of
the S&P 500 and the QQQ are near
historic highs. Big commentators like
Tom Lee are on CNBC talking about how
the market's going to go higher every
single day. The bears in this market are
long gone. They've been fired. They've
been let go of their jobs. Their
predictions have been wrong. And
nobody's listening to the bears. Even
Michael Bur, the biggest bear of them
all, is finally back to shorting stocks.
Some of the top stocks in the market,
some of the ones with the most
exuberance, like Palunteer, of which the
CEO of Palunteer, a stock that's worth
100 times price to sales, responded to
Michael Bur saying that it's bat shiz
crazy.
>> Super weird. Like the idea that chips
and what you want to short is bat crazy.
>> And so far, he's been correct. Shorting
anything in this market has been a
mistake because this is a bull market.
But as investors, if we're managing any
amount of our wealth and our savings
that we've worked hard for, we should be
good stewards of it. We should be
careful with the gains that we've made
and the investments that we're making.
We shouldn't follow in to the crowd with
exuberance, beating up stock prices
higher and higher. We should be looking
for the best deals in the market, the
ones that have ample downside
protection, the ones where we're not
going to get burned buying these
companies. But the question is, which
ones do we buy? There are thousands of
companies in the market. So many that
it's difficult to choose from. But in
this episode, I'll be going over six
investment ideas. Six companies that I
believe are still fantastic buys in an
expensive market. Now, of course, like
always, we have a lot of other news
we'll be getting into this episode as
well. We have the Uber CEO going on to
CNBC explaining what happened this week
with their earnings report, and he lays
out an investment thesis for the future
of Uber. We also have news that Amazon
has sued Perplexity to stop them from
using their AI tool to buy stuff.
Perplexity responded by saying that
Amazon is a bully and bullying is not
innovation. Is it true that Amazon is
just a big bad bully pushing around the
smaller company Perplexity where their
only crime is simply trying to innovate?
Well, of course, there's a lot more to
the story we'll be going over. So, we
have all of this to get into, plus much
more. Before we jump in, just a quick
note. If you want to upgrade your
investment analysis and have a better
understanding of companies, Qualramum is
a platform that will turn you into a
super investor. It is the best stock
analysis platform. I know that because
I've built Qualrrim from the ground up.
It is tailor made for value investors
that want to focus on a company's
fundamental developments over the next 5
years. One exciting development that
we've recently done is we made it so you
can sign up directly on qualum.com. You
can choose between a monthly plan with a
7-day free trial and an annual plan at a
heavily discounted rate. Both of these
are dirt cheap at under $10 per month.
We have 11,000 active users on Qualrim,
and they love the platform for a reason.
It's super cheap, easy to use, and it
upgrades you as an investor. You can try
it out now directly at qual.com where
you'll gain access to Qualrim as well as
the Joseph Carlson Show Discord where we
discuss investing amongst thousands of
investors. You can join the conversation
there at no additional charge. Now, we
start things off today by looking at six
of the companies that I believe have the
best stories in the market over the next
5 years. The first one is Meta. Meta
just recently reported earnings along
with a lot of other companies. But
instead of the stock price skyrocketing
up like Google, Meta stock price fell.
Google's stock is up 50% year-to- date
and over 13% in just the past month,
Meta Stock is only up 6% year-to date,
dragging behind both the S&P 500 and the
QQQ. In the past month, it's down 11%.
Now, anytime a high-quality company goes
through a sell-off, it's worth looking
at. And part of the reason why Meta's
underperforming and selling off may be
temporary. Meta's underperformance is
due to a couple different factors, but
it's reminiscent of what happened in
2022 when Mark Zuckerberg was obsessed
with talking about the metaverse. The
problem then, similar to the problem
now, is expected spending on capital
expenditures. Meta is simply spending a
fortune on capex. Zuckerberg said that
Meta would spend as much as $72 billion
this year and quote notably larger in
2026. Then on the earnings call, he
continued to downplay the concerns that
Meta might be overspending on things
like these super intelligence labs,
saying, quote, "It's the right strategy
to aggressively frontload building
capacity." Portfolio managers and
investors are saying, quote, "This feels
like a return to Meta's old days of
overspending on things that are
frivolous or which don't have
appropriate return demand tied to them."
This seems like history's rhyming, if
not repeating. We have a very similar
situation. Meta is selling off big time,
underperforming the market because the
leadership is set on spending a lot of
money on future capex investments that
investors aren't completely sold on.
Well, we can look back in 2022 and see
how that ended up. From 2022, Meta was
below $200 per share. It even got as low
as $100 per share. Now, it's currently
around $550 to $600 per share. It's had
incredible outperformance over this time
period. Now, again, the situation isn't
identical. There were other concerns
with Meta in 2022, and the Ford PE ratio
is much lower during that time period.
But again, even though they're not
identical, there's a lot of
similarities. The metaverse spending
concerns caused the stock to drop more
than Meta has literally ever dropped
before. The biggest drop in a 4-day
period throughout its entire history.
Then we see another massive drop for a
similar reason. And I believe that
there's less reason for investors to be
concerned now than there was in 2022.
For example, the reason that investors
were concerned about spend in 2022 was
because it was for the metaverse, for
the headsets, for these niche products
that billions of people did not use. So,
investors had reason to be concerned.
They thought that the CEO was not really
attaching their future spending to
something that had high return
potential. If we look at the sell-off
today, the reason that the stock is
going down is because of AI spending
concerns. Now Meta is spending a lot
more money, but they're spending on
something that is a lot more relevant of
a product to a lot more people. Spending
in data capacity and AI is something
that has far bigger applications and can
benefit the company in far more diverse
ways than just metaverse spending.
Another thing that I think about with
this selloff and meta is that frankly
Mark Zuckerberg is correct. It is the
right strategy to just aggressively
frontload building capacity. That's been
proven time and time again. If you don't
frontload the building of capacity, then
the demand comes, you cannot fulfill on
it and you don't gain that market share.
With Meta, there's a dual-pronged
approach. First, there's many people on
Wall Street downgrading Meta stock
because they say, quote, "There's
significant investment in super
intelligence despite unknown revenue
opportunity mirroring the 2021 2022
metaverse." Meta hasn't proven a lot
with their super intelligence in the
same way that Google has with Deep Mind
or their cloud hosting. Google has a
very clear path to having high returns.
But the thing that Wall Street is
missing here is even if this is the
case, let's assume that Meta spends a
bunch of money on super intelligence and
it doesn't come to fruition. They don't
get a high return on that super
intelligence spend. Well, there's
different use cases for this server
capacity. There's different things that
Meta can do to utilize this spend. Mark
Zuckerberg notes that if this big bet in
super intelligence spend does not pay
off, they still have other use cases for
all this aggressive capex spend. He
says, quote, "That way, if super
intelligence arrives sooner, we will be
ideally positioned for a generational
paradigm shift in many larger
opportunities. If it takes longer, if
this spend doesn't have a return on
super intelligence, quote, then we'll
use the extra compute to accelerate our
core business, which continues to be
able to profitably use much more compute
than we've been able to throw at it.
Mark Zuckerberg has done the riskreward
calculation for this spend. If he spends
now, he has the opportunity to
potentially get to super intelligence,
which will be a huge paradigm shift. If
that does not happen, then Mark
Zuckerberg can reroute all that spend,
all that capex, all those GPUs on making
their core services more profitable,
more AI ads, more AI generated slop for
the now 3.54 billion daily active people
using one of their apps. They have half
the world using their applications. Mark
Zuckerberg knows this and he knows that
any spend on compute will be used. The
capacity is not going to go to waste.
The stock now trading at a 21 Ford PE
ratio, a 2.7% free cash flow yield with
it having a one-time tax hit dragging
down its profitability in the short
term. Meta now has a good story over the
next 5 years. One of being the framework
for social media throughout the world.
Now, moving on, we get to two companies
that I believe are very similar in their
investment thesis. We have Salesforce
and we have Adobe. Both of these
companies trade at optically low
valuations. Meaning that if we just look
at one of them, let's take Salesforce
and we look at some of the valuation
metrics, they look pretty cheap.
Salesforce trades at a 24p ratio, a 5%
free cash flow yield. Even adjusting out
the healthy level stockbased comp they
have it is a 3.79%
free cash flow yield. That is similar to
highly cyclical, slow growing, heavy
capex businesses, ones like industrials.
But in this case, Salesforce is a
company with growing margins, growing
revenue, and quickly growing earnings
and free cash flow. Adobe looks even
cheaper today. At a 14.5 PE ratio and a
6.9%
free cash flow yield, even adjusting out
the stockbased comp were at 5.5%.
This is incredibly cheap by the numbers.
You would assume companies trading at
these valuation multiples would be
companies that are dying or in decay.
But to the contrary, both of these
companies are growing. Salesforce is
growing between 8 to 10%, this is well
above the rate of inflation. Every
segment of the business is growing. We
have Adobe which is growing a little
faster. Revenue is growing 10 to 12% per
year. You can see the long-term trend is
in line since 2014. These are both
business critical services. Companies
sign long-term agreements with them
beyond one-year contracts. With
Salesforce, their contractual revenue
growth grew by 12%. We look at Adobe and
we see the total performance
obligations, their contractual revenue
growing likewise 12 to 13%
year-over-year. Both of these companies
are incredibly free cash flow positive.
Salesforce now generates 12 to$13
billion in free cash flow. And you may
say, well, Salesforce is a dilutive
company. Look at all the stockbased
comp. That view is a bit outdated. You
could have said that they're a highly
dilutive company back in 2022 when 50%
of their free cash flow was stockbased
comp. But now the stockbased comp has
held steady for 3 years while the free
cash flow has gone up two to three times
as much. Adobe likewise has rapidly
growing free cash flows. It's gone
through some time periods of investment,
but now it's at all-time highs, $9.6
billion in free cash flow, a 12%
increase over the past 2 years, a 14%
keer over the past 5 years. Both
companies are returning more capital
back to the shareholder. Salesforce is
doing it via dividend and through
buyback. Adobee's ramping up their
buybacks even faster. In the past 12
months, they bought back 11 billion
worth of common stock. For Salesforce,
the price to earnings ratio is at a low
over the past 3 years. Both of these
companies have gone down as the rest of
the market has raced up. As investors,
we don't know when the fundamentals will
come into play, when investors will
start to value these stocks once again,
when the winds of sentiment will shift,
but it will eventually happen if these
companies continue to perform. They are
so cheap now. They have such good
economics. If these companies continue
to grow over the next five years at even
a moderate pace, they will have
exceptional returns. Now, some of these
companies I own, some I don't. In the
passive income portfolio, I don't own
Meta. I've chosen to go with Google. I
don't own Adobe, but I've chosen to go
with Salesforce. The next couple of
companies that are undervalued today and
worthy of new buys are in the finance
category. We have Equifax and S&P
Global. You could also include FICO or
Moody's in this group of companies. I
believe this entire category is
undervalued. If we look at the
performance of these stocks, I have many
of them in my portfolio, but all the
ones that are in the green are the ones
that I've owned for well over a year.
For example, S&P Global is up 28,000,
Mastercard 34,000 into it 21,000 and
Moody's 10,000. These are good gains,
but almost all of these gains came
before 2025. In fact, if I filter this
by the year to date, you can see how
these performed. S&P Global's flat.
Mastercard's up 5.7%
underperforming the S&P 500. In its up
5.4%, underperforming the S&P 500.
Moody's is up 3.3% and Equifax is the
worst performer, down 15%. This entire
category has underperformed the S&P 500
in 2025. That's actually not a reason to
be concerned. In some cases, the market
focuses on different trends and momentum
pushing the indicy higher. And in this
case, there's no focus on these
highquality finance companies. The major
focus has been on AI companies. But if
we look at what's going on under the
hood of companies like S&P Global and
Equifax, it paints a much better
picture. S&P Global is a company that's
grown its revenue at moderate rates
above expectations. They grew their net
income above expectations, and they even
raised their guidance above what the
guidance was expected. They grew their
free cash flow above expectations, and
they've raised guidance on their free
cash flow as well. The company is still
a powerhouse diversified wideboat
company with ever growing earnings per
share. Everything seems like business as
usual for S&P Global. If we look at
Equifax, it's a different business but
operating in a similar industry. The
share price of Equifax falling 17%
year-to date may leave you with the
impression that the business is
fumbling. Things are struggling. The
company's having its moat eroded. That
doesn't reflect the situation going on
with this company at all. Equifax isn't
only just performing to expectations,
they're beating expectations. They're
raising their guidance every single
quarter. They continue to say, "Hey,
investors, we're going to earn even more
money than you expected us to earn."
While the market continues to discount
these companies, saying that they're not
great investments today. Investors
shouldn't be focused on them. I believe
there's reasons why investors should be
focused on Equifax, S&P Global, or
Moody's or FICO. You could throw all of
them in the mix. This is a category that
should see massive tailwinds over the
next couple of years. One of them is
interest rates being lowered. These
companies benefit in diverse ways from
interest rates being lowered. There's
higher debt issuance which benefits S&P
Global and Moody's. More people take out
loans which benefits companies like
Equifax. More people take out mortgages
which benefits FICO and again Equifax.
There's also just more economic activity
and more interest in investment, which
benefits S&P Global's data, market, and
indices business. Lower interest rates
benefit these companies immensely, and
interest rates will continue to go
lower. President Trump even said that
the new Fed chair that he's putting in,
the major reason he's kicking out JPAL
and putting in a new one is to lower
interest rates. Another thing that will
benefit these businesses is artificial
intelligence. They'll be able to do more
with fewer employees. As AI picks up
steam and these tools get implemented
across these companies, they will be
able to offer more tools, more products
for their customers at reduced costs. So
you'll see margins and operating
leverage continue to pick up. So even
though the market has ignored companies
like S&P Global, Moody's or Equifax this
year, they've been underperforming so
far. Their fundamentals show no
underperformance. They are growing
faster than expected, raising guidance,
and they have many cattle for the
future. I believe they're all buys
today. Now, finally, in number six, the
last stock that I'll highlight that I
believe is a buy today is in the Story
Fund. In this portfolio, I have a more
concentrated look on a few companies,
and one of them that has been an
incredible winner in this portfolio, of
course, is Netflix. It was as high as
$1,300 per share, and now it's below
$1,100 per share. While some investors
will interpret this as an overpriced
company coming back down to a more
realistic valuation, I see it
differently. I think that this is an
opportunity for investors that have
missed out on Netflix to finally take a
bite. And the reason why is because I
believe that Netflix is not overvalued.
I've studied this company for a long
period of time and I still believe
there's far more to come that's not
being priced in for Netflix. For
example, we have the immediate catalyst.
We have the things that Wall Street
knows about that investors are expecting
like the Stranger Things finale. This is
going to be what people talk about the
end of this year. This is going to be a
massive shared TV experience. across the
entire internet. There's not many things
that unite hundreds of millions of
people across the world under a single
event. The other most recent thing
that's caused hundreds of millions of
people to unite under a single event is
likely the K-pop Demon Hunter movie.
These are all owned by Netflix. The big
shared experiences across the globe are
now being owned by Netflix. But more
importantly than just a few pieces of
content uniting the world, we also have
the sheer financial strengths of this
company. It is a cash flow juggernaut
with ever growing margins and fast
growing revenue with a huge total
addressable market and a long continued
growing runway for growth. If we look at
Netflix, there's just a couple things
that I want to highlight. First of all,
we have the revenue growth of the
company growing at 15%. This is in the
upper higher tier of companies. Uh a lot
of companies again are are struggling to
grow maybe 8 to 12%. Netflix has cracked
the code on pricing, on tears, on
getting a lot of people to sign up for
their company. They have a cheaper
priced ad tier. They have different
premium price to subscription tiers.
They have a plan for basically anyone.
You can even add on Friends for $3 a
month. So, Netflix makes its service
incredibly affordable to the broader
public. And the value proposition that
they offer is immense. With all the
content they offer, all the movies, all
the documentaries, all the live events,
all the sporting events, it's very
difficult to not have a Netflix
subscription. So Netflix is now
transitioning to this company where it
will have sustained revenue growth. The
revenue should continue to grow between
14 to 16% throughout 2026, another
entire year of the same speed of revenue
growth. That is my estimate for this
company. And then after 2026, I could
see it slowing down incrementally from
there. But the deceleration will be
slow. Netflix has a very long runway of
ample revenue growth. One of the
benefits that Netflix has is incredible
levels of operating leverage. Despite
many people's beliefs, and many people
have gotten this wrong over time,
Netflix does not need to raise their
content spend or the amount that they're
spending on producing all of their shows
at the same rate that they raise their
revenue. They do not need to do that.
And you see that in the numbers over the
past 5 years. From 2019 to current day,
Netflix only increased their spend on
content by a marginal amount. Meanwhile,
revenue has over doubled. So this is a
company exercising incredible levels of
operating leverage. And again, many
investors have gotten this wrong. Awatan
was one of the most notable, saying that
Netflix's big spending business model
can't last. He says they're on a mouse
wheel of content spend, and it was not
sustainable. These were the views shared
in 2018, but Netflix showed that that's
not the case. With revenue continuing to
grow at 15% and content spend growing at
only 7%, the operating margins of the
company continue to tick up every single
day. In fact, Netflix's operating
margins are so high now, it's in the
higher premium category of highly
efficient companies. Without the
one-time tax hit from Brazil, the
operating margins were closer to 29%.
above expectations. Once again, they're
guiding for future growth and operating
margins. My estimate is that they will
continue to keep their content spend
tight. It'll come in under analyst
expectations. The operating margins will
continue to tick up above analyst
expectations. In fact, I believe by
2031,
so around 5 years from now, this will be
about double. We'll see operating
margins of around 50%. That seems crazy.
Now, Netflix with 50% operating margins,
but they have a clear path to get there.
They have incredible levels of operating
leverage. Companies that create content
scale incredibly well. If you have a
company that has that level of operating
leverage, you're also going to see
exponential earnings per share growth.
The earnings per share grew by 35%
year-over-year. And that's with this
last quarter having a one-time
substantial tax hit. It'd be even faster
without that. I expect the earnings per
share growth to grow above 25% over the
next 3 years. Netflix will be one of the
fastest EPS growing companies in the
market. Then we get to how all of this
translates to pure free cash flow. The
best estimate of how much money a
company's actually making. Netflix is
one of the least dilutive free cash flow
companies you could buy. With only a
tiny amount, $300 million of stockbased
compared to $9 billion of free cash
flow. And Netflix is growing its free
cash flow at an incredibly fast pace.
26% year-over-year. In 2025, they're
guiding for $9 billion in free cash
flow, a notable step up of 7 billion
just a year ago. But it doesn't end
there. By the end of 2026, I believe
that Netflix will have around $14
billion in free cash flow generated
based on the operating leverage, based
on the growth of this company. So, we're
going to go from 7 to 9 all the way up
to around 14. this company's free cash
flow will continue to spike. And on top
of that, it's not just free cash flow.
It's also free cash flow per share
that's growing even faster. Netflix is
now a company that's in a place to do a
massive amount of share repurchases.
This is an incredible fortunate
situation to be in. Netflix is a stock
that I believe is less obvious than the
others because it's still priced as a
premium company, but I believe it will
have above premium performance. This
company will continue to surprise. It'll
continue to adapt and grow and the
financials should support massive share
price increases over the next 5 years.
For me, it's worth buying. Now, of
course, there's no guarantees that all
these stocks will go up and to the
right. That never is the case with
investing, but I believe investors will
do very well with any of those stocks
over the next 5 years. Now, moving on,
we get into some news of some other
companies that have reported earnings,
Uber being one of them. The stock is
down a little bit, but overall, it's
been a fantastic year for Uber
investors. The stock is up dramatically
on the year-to- date. And here's Darra,
the Uber CEO, sharing his view this
quarter.
>> Well, I think uh what drove it is
strength across all sectors. Our
mobility business accelerated uh versus
last quarter in tops in terms of topline
growth. Our delivery business
accelerated as well. Uh trips 3 and a
half billion trips uh this quarter up
22%. Big acceleration versus the last
quarter. Uh gross bookings now just
south of 50 billion. uh quarter and up
21% and then of course you know
delivering on profitability as well. Uh
our ebida up uh 33% on a year-on-year
basis. So we're seeing a business that
continues to be strong. It's actually
accelerating in terms of momentum and
we're able to scale profits while we do
so. So Andrew, at this point we see blue
skies. Uh obviously we are watching out
in terms of the economies, the global
economies, but at this point uh the
business continues to hit on all
cylinders. He has a great summary and I
agree with everything he said. Looking
at Uber, it had another great quarter
even though the stock is being a little
bit squabbbly today. I love it when the
executive is focused on the big picture
while being realistic.
>> We're very lucky to be operating in uh
you know the transportation services
ecosystem that is over a trillion
dollars. the online food delivery or
food ecosystem that's over $2 trillion.
And now we're extending into grocery and
retail. Uh we were uh at a 12 billion
run rate as it relates to grocery and
retail. And what we're seeing is people
want ondemand uh transportation
regardless of where they want. They want
to push a button and get to a place, but
sometimes when they want to stay home,
they want to be able to push a button
and get their groceries uh and have
someone else maybe do their Thanksgiving
shopping for them. So I do think it's a
combination of both. We are unique and
different from all the other players in
that not only are we global in scope,
but we also operate a mobility uh
marketplace and a delivery marketplace
that talk to each other, we share
customers, we share uh merchants, for
example, on the ad front. Um it's a it's
a platform that no one else can match.
And as a result, while the category is
super healthy, we're also generally
gaining category position and growing
faster than the overall category.
>> Now, he highlights Uber's relative
growth, which is important to note that
they're taking market share and the
category that they're taking market
share in is also a growing category.
This has been the theme of many
successful investments. You don't just
want a company that's winning, but you
want a company that's winning in a
growing area. And what he said about
people just wanting to press a button, I
think is the best explanation of why
companies like Uber or Door Dash or
Amazon or Netflix or Spotify are so
successful. People want things that make
life easier. They want to make life much
easier for them. This is where
technology and scaled technology makes
life easier. It resembles in very
similar fashion how Amazon was so
successful. They took a difficult
complicated process of online shopping
15 to 20 years ago and they simplified
it dramatically. They made products easy
to buy and eventually made it so you
could simply buy a product with a single
click and then in 2 days it would show
up on your doorstep. People love
convenience. They love simplicity and
Uber offers that at scale. It's going to
continue to grow in this category. Now
moving on, we have news that one of my
largest positions which is Amazon. I I
believe Amazon and I I've mentioned it
so many times that I I think it's one of
the best companies in the market to own
today. I I just think it should be in
everyone's portfolio right now. We have
news here. Here's the title of the
article. Amazon sues to stop Perplexity
from using AI tool to buy stuff. Amazon
filed a lawsuit Tuesday demanding
Perplexity stop allowing its AI browser
agent comment to make purchases online
for users. The e-commerce giant is
accusing Perplexity of committing
computer fraud by failing to disclose
when comment is shopping on a real
person's behalf in violation of Amazon's
terms of service. Amazon is introducing
a dispute after sending a cease and
desist letter to the startup Friday,
accusing the smaller company of
degrading the Amazon shopping experience
and introducing privacy vulnerabilities.
So basically what's going on here is
Perplexity, similar to OpenAI, announced
a new browser. OpenAI's browser is
called Atlas. Perplexity is called
Comet. and they're both wouldbe
competitors to Chrome. But with
Perplexity's browser, it has an AI
shopping tool where it will help you
scrape information and buy different
things on Amazon, bypassing Amazon's
user interface and making it all go
through Perplexity's AI agents. Amazon
claims that Perplexity's browser
pretends that it's simply a user through
Chrome accessing the website, when in
reality, it's an AI agent that behaves
and acts in non-human ways. And this is
in direct violation of Amazon's agreed
upon terms of service for each user.
Now, Perplexity responded by trying to
portray and frame Amazon as a bully. A
bully that's against innovation.
Perplexity wrote a blog post saying how
innovation comes when people make new
products and bigger companies always try
to stop innovation by bullying these
smaller corporations. They're framing it
as user choice. That users should be
able to access Amazon in any way that
they want. and that users love the Comet
user experience. They claim that their
AI browser is private, personal, and
powerful, and that they're not going to
be intimidated by the big bad bully,
which is Amazon. Now, Amazon responded
to Perplexity's blog post portraying
them as a bully. Amazon says, quote, "We
think it's fairly straightforward that
third-party applications that offer to
make purchases on behalf of customers
from other businesses should operate
openly and respect service providers
decisions whether or not to participate.
This helps ensure a positive customer
experience and it's how others operate,
including food delivery apps and the
restaurants they take orders from,
delivery service apps and the stores
they shop from, and online travel
agencies in the airlines they book
tickets with and for customers. Agentic
third-party applications such as
Perplexity's Comet have the same
obligations, and we've repeatedly
requested that Perplexity remove Amazon
from the comment experience. So, there's
the breakdown between the two sides. And
this argument has huge implications. It
could determine the future of AI
origentic shopping. For example,
Perplexity is saying that Amazon cannot
control their user experience. We can
control that. We can create applications
that log in on behalf of the user that
completely change the interface to
whatever way we want. that can scan
thousands of listings, do agentic
searches, scrape the website, transform
the data, manipulate the data, and scan
and use your product and service in any
way that we want. Amazon's saying that
although you want to do that, you don't
have the right to do that. A lot of this
lawsuit comes down to things of whether
or not terms of service really matter,
whether they should be respected. A
terms of service is a contract between
the customer and a user of that service.
Now, most people don't really look at
it, but there are some legal protections
that make sense for services. For
example, a a boilerplate terms of
service for most applications and
websites is you can't scrape the
website. You simply can't create a bot
that logs into a service like Bloomberg
and scrape every single article every
day and then export all that data
somewhere else. That's not how it's
intended to be used. That's not how
Bloomberg or the Wall Street Journal
wants you to use their application. They
don't want you to create an application
that scrapes all the data and exports it
somewhere. So, they write that into the
terms of service. Now, from their
perspective, that seems reasonable.
They're not selling a product that you
can come in and copy everything from the
product. That's very similar to saying
that you can't go into a movie theater
with a camera recorder and record the
entire movie. That's not the way that
movie theaters are intending to share
their product. They want you to
experience it in a normal human
behavior, not in these other ways that
violate their intended use. Imagine if
food delivery companies like a Door Dash
and Uber Eats said, "Hey restaurants,
you have to partner with us. You don't
get a choice or how your restaurant
operates or what type of apps you want
to integrate with, which ones you don't
want to integrate with." For now on,
every single restaurant has to use Uber
Eats or Door Dash because that's the way
the customer wants to use it. Many
restaurants don't partner with Door
Dash. They don't partner with Uber
Eatats because they don't want to have
their margins hit. It's not an intended
use of business that they want to
cooperate with and some of them do. That
is the choice of the business owner with
restaurants. And like Amazon points out
here, I believe that's a strikingly
similar example. If we were to say every
company has to use a Gentic technology,
it's very similar to saying every
company has to use food delivery apps.
every travel agency and airlines, they
now have to operate with booking
holdings and with Airbnb. They have no
choice in the matter. They have to
operate with these new technologies. And
while Perplexity likes to act like it's
on the moral high ground, being an
innovative company and a smaller one
that's being bullied by a big bad
company, that couldn't be further from
the truth. Perplexity is simply being
asked to operate like any other business
and respecting the simple and reasonable
terms of service of a company. Now
again, you may not say that terms of
service are meaningful, but even
Perplexity themselves believes that
terms of service are meaningful enough
to highlight them front and center on
their legal hub. And they have extensive
terms of service for the intended use of
their own application. And amongst
perplexities own terms of service, they
say that you may not do any of the
following things in connection of your
use of the services. write on their own
services. They say that you cannot use
automated software, bots, hacks, or
modifications or any other unauthorized
third-party software designed to modify
the services. In Perplexity's own
products, they ban people from using
automated software and bots or otherwise
known as AI agents. You cannot exploit
the service for commercial purposes,
which is exactly what Perplexity is
doing. They want to bypass Amazon's use
case, making it so that Amazon cannot
serve advertising and users pay
perplexity and use their comment
browser, paying a fee every single month
at the detriment of Amazon. This is
precisely what perplexity blocks in
their own terms of service. Perplexity
is very careful to outline the same
thing over and over again that you
cannot use anything like a bot, a
spider, a crawler or a scraper or other
automated devices to process their
software or their queries. If it is true
that scraping websites, changing the
user behavior using bots and AI
automation tools to log in and use your
product however you want. If that's such
a good thing, perplexity, then why are
you banning it through your own terms of
service? Why is your legal team exactly
like Amazon highlighting that that's not
how you want your technology to be used?
Is it because it might break your
business model? It may break your
product. It may not be the way that you
want your services to be used. It's not
the way that you built them and designed
them. Could that be the case?
Perplexity. If Amazon is a bully for
enforcing their terms of service, then
Perplexity is a hypocrite for enforcing
the exact same terms of service upon
their users. That's going to be it for
this episode.
