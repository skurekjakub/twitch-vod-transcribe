Welcome back everyone. Today on the
Joseph Carlson show, I'm buying more of
a specific stock. The stock is Amazon
and we're going to be going over it. So,
I'll be going over why I'm okay that
Amazon's such a large position, why I'm
okay with this one potentially even
passing up Google to be my biggest
position. On the show today, we're also
going to be looking at five other
companies that are potentially great
investments, ones that have sold off.
These are all stocks that have sold off
nearly 50% from their recent highs. The
market has thrown out these companies.
They've left it for dead, but we're
going to take a look and see if there's
opportunity with these five stocks. And
then, as always, we have a lot of news
to get to. Tom Lee is going on the news
today explaining the market selloff. Tom
Lee's not too concerned about the market
selloff over the past couple of days.
I'll be reacting to his thoughts. Dan
Ies believes that we're well into an
innovation renaissance. We'll be hearing
his arguments as well. Netflix is now
expanding into gaming and not just games
that they're licensing, but now ones
that you use your phone as a controller
and play party games on the TV. And then
finally, we have another fail of the
week to get to, which in this case is a
post from Michael Sailor showing him
fleeing a burning ship that is also
sinking. So, we have all of that to
discuss, plus much more. Tons to get
into in this episode. Before we start
off, just a quick mention. We've had an
enormous interest in Qualrram over the
past couple of weeks as now you can

to in this episode and we kick things
off today looking at the new buy. Now, I
have two portfolios. The smaller of the
two is the story fund, but it's growing
quickly because I've decided to continue
investing in this portfolio. At first,
it was only to to demonstrate that you
could outperform the S&P 500 and the
QQQ. Spoiler alert, it outperformed the
S&P 500 and the QQQ by a pretty wide
margin. Every year, it's gone up
substantially for the past three years,
far outperforming the market. It did dip
down a lot in 2022 because all these
companies had a sell-off, but doubling
down on these companies at the lows,
buying more Netflix really bumped up the
performance. The reason that this
portfolio has done so well, I believe,
is because it's a combination of picking
out really good companies and then more
importantly sticking to those companies
during difficult times. It's easy to
pick out good companies, but it's
difficult to invest in them when other
people are telling you they're not good
companies. That was the case with
Netflix. There was a time period where
people didn't believe it was a good
company. That was when Bill Aman sold
the company. He was very uncertain and
unsure about the future. Those decision
points of just being willing to wait a
little bit and hold is very important
because if you get scared out of a
stock, you miss all the outperformance
that comes along with it when it
eventually recovers. And typically good
companies do recover. It's the very same
thing that we saw with Google just 6
months ago. People were extremely unsure
of Google saying that it was literally
being disrupted like the walls were
caving in. The sky was falling. Google
was being disrupted by Chachi PT. Now
the stock is up 80% in 6 months. No
longer is Google being talked about as
being disrupted. Now it's actually being
talked about as potentially being a
better company than Microsoft, a bigger
company than Microsoft. It's growing
into a massive subscription business.
They have YouTube and cloud growing very
quickly. They have all these business
tools as well. The tone can change very
quickly for high-quality companies. The
test for investors is identifying them
and investing in them and then holding
them when people are telling you to
sell. And I always find that third part
to be the most challenging part with
Amazon. This is another company that's
gone through many difficult time
periods. Right now, I wouldn't say is
the most difficult. Amazon stock has
finally gotten a little bit of
recognition because AWS finally sped
back up. It had its first quarter above
20%. And this is where we get into what
I consider the near-term catalyst and
the long-term thesis. When we look at
the basic characteristics of what I look
for in an investment, you can boil it
down to having a dominant lead in their
category. I like companies that are
already winning, not ones that are way
behind that I think can catch up. I want
ones that are already in the lead.
Amazon is the biggest online retailer by
far. They have a dominant market
position. They're number one in the
world. Then you have cloud hosting.
Guess what company's number one in the
world? It's Amazon. AWS is much bigger
than Azure and Google. We read headlines
that Google and Azure is growing faster.
And while that's true, we don't read as
many headlines that really emphasize the
size and scale difference of AWS to
either Azure or Google Cloud. Azure and
Google Cloud have far fewer customers.
It's estimated that Amazon has millions,
multiple millions of customers. Google
is just surpassing 1 million. and Azure,
it's a little bit more difficult to
know. Most of Azure's cloud is from a
few companies that are really large.
Amazon is far more diversified. It's in
the leading position in AWS. Then you
have advertising. You have Google as
number one. Meta is number two. Then you
have Amazon as number three. So they're
number one in online retail. They're
number one in cloud hosting. They're
number three in the world in
advertising. And they have by far the
most intent driven ads in the world.
Meaning that when people go to
amazon.com, their intent is to buy
something. So even though they're in
third place, they're not in a situation
like Meta or Google where you go to
their websites for one reason and they
have to try to convince you to buy
something when that wasn't your intent.
With Amazon, you're going to their place
to buy something. That makes their ads
far more lucrative. But then you add on
top of that Prime Video, which Prime
Video, by the way, is likely number two
in the world in streaming behind
Netflix, which has massive ad reach,
more ad reach than any platform today.
So Amazon's number one in online retail,
number one in cloud hosting, number
three in online ads, and number two in
online video streaming. We have a
company that's dominant and near the top
of the pack in multiple verticals. It's
extraordinary to see what this company
has accomplished and it's still growing.
It's still expanding. What Amazon is
doing is not resting on its laurels.
It's not just trying to go into profit
mode and kick its feet up. Amazon is now
a company that's still aggressively
investing in new endeavors. One of the
biggest things that they've highlighted
as a near-term catalyst is grocery.
Grocery is something that is often
scoffed at by investors. like why would
you want to invest in a company that
that goes into a low margin thing like
grocery? But I don't believe that's the
way that you should look at it. An
example we can look at that's a great
company that's in grocery today is
Costco. Costco is a grocery company.
Now, it's not just grocery. There's a
lot of other reasons to go to Costco,
but part of the reason you go to Costco
is to have lowcost, super cheap
groceries. You get the best value
possible in bigger quantities. If you're
buying a lot of something, you want to
go to Costco. If you want to get high
quality meats and produce, you want to
go to Costco. So, this is part of the
reason people shop there. Costco, a
grocery company, trades at a 46 forward
PE. Well, that's a little bit of a head
scratcher. Shouldn't a low margin,
terrible business like grocery trade at
a super low PE ratio? No, because we
know that what these companies do is
they use something that people need
every single day. They need to eat. They
need groceries every single day. People
need this. It's a part of life. It's one
of the human connections that these
companies are going to have and have
long lifetime value by you constantly
needing groceries. They use that and
they wrap that customer loyalty and
consistency into a bigger business
model, a better one. They attach it to
subscriptions. So what Amazon is doing
is pushing into a low margin bad
business which is grocery and then
they're going to layer that into further
subscriptions which are high margin. The
very same business model that Costco has
accomplished. Costco maintains an
incredibly high PE ratio because it has
high returns on capital employed meaning
it can take a small amount of money
invest it and get super high returns.
It's also a company that has
unquestionable moat. It's a company that
has unyielding customer loyalty. These
type of characteristics come when you
have something as dependable as grocery.
You wrap it into a much better business
model. We can see the growth of Costco
and their card holders look like this.
Consistently growing every single
quarter because everyone in the world
needs grocery. Walmart understands this
as well. Walmart's a company that
actually has the advantage in grocery.
If we look at Walmart, it's another
example of a company that should have a
low PE ratio, right? Because groceries
are low margin. That's the thought. But
that doesn't really represent what goes
on with these companies. Walmart,
similar to Costco, trades at a 35 Ford
PE. Not quite as high because Walmart
isn't quite as membership or
subscription driven, but they have that
model. So investors need to get it out
of their minds that grocery is a bad
business. It's not. Groceries in and of
themselves, of course, they're low
margin, but you can look at them kind of
like a Trojan horse for a subscription
business, which is super high margin.
And that is the exact tactic that, of
course, Amazon will do. Amazon will
implement groceries. They'll push into
this category. They already have the
logistics network. They already have
Whole Foods established all throughout
the nation. They don't have quite the
presence of Walmart, but they can
establish this quickly. Amazon has the
will, the capital, and the knowhow to
execute on grocery. And if they can
create that weekly connection, making it
a part of people's daily lives, then
they can charge more for their
subscriptions. They can include more in
their membership. They can grow that
nice stream of reliable high margin
revenue. And Amazon again knows this.
They are pushing hard into grocery. In
their last earnings report, there's a
whole segment dedicated to retail and
grocery selection expansion by 14%
quarter over quarter with addition of
popular brands. Everyday Essentials
nearly doubling growth rate of the rest
of the business. Significant expansion
and perishable grocery delivery. Now in
1,000 plus cities, targeting 2,300 by
the year end. So by 2025's end, they
want to double the amount of over double
the amount of places they're in grocery.
Another thing that of course is a
near-term catalyst for Amazon is the
continued reaceleration story of AWS. If
we look at the KPI on Qualrum here, we
have the AWS on a quarterly basis and
you can see it grow over time and then
most importantly the most recent
quarter, it reacelerated growth beyond
20%. So the near-term catalyst I see in
Amazon and the reason that I'm buying it
today is they're going to continue
growing AWS and accelerating their
growth. I think that more capacity is
going to come online. I believe that
next quarter it's going to grow above
20%. I think it will continue to
reacelerate. So that's going to be a big
catalyst. Investors will have a hard
time selling the stock off when AWS is
growing at a more accelerated pace. Then
we also have the grocery business, which
I think is a very near-term catalyst for
the company. The grocery business
expanding really puts the end to the
story of Walmart invading Amazon's
territory. Those are both short-term
catalysts, but I also believe Amazon has
a very good long-term thesis. As I've
said before, I think this company is
going to become a company of margin
expansion. So, you're going to have
long-term revenue growth with their
expansion into grocery with their AWS
growth, but you're also going to have
margins expand. Amazon is doing layoffs.
And while that's sad for the employees
being let go, it also means that
Amazon's trying to operate more
efficiently, increasing their margins by
lowering employee expense. For most
companies, they hire 10, 20,000
employees. They can run somewhat
efficiently. Amazon has 1.5 million
employees. They have tens of thousands
in the office which AI will help become
higher margin. And then you also have
more than a million employees in
warehouses and as delivery drivers. We
know that over time those jobs will be
automated to a huge extent. Humans will
be put in roles as supervisors and
organizers of the automation of the
robots and of the AI more than doing all
those tasks themselves. So what I see
longterm with this company over the next
5 to 10 years of this continual story of
automation and margin improvement and I
see very limited downside in the stock
with this many catalysts. Of course
Amazon could sell off if the entire
market does that happens but the
fundamentals are going to continue
upward. Now moving on we get into five
companies that I've outlined as ones
that I believe the market is is just
they're just selling off. Investors
don't want anything to do with these
companies. They almost have like a
bitter taste in investors mouths. They
they just are not stocks that investors
want to talk about, ones that they want
to consider. Those are in many cases the
best stocks to look at, ones that
investors are a little bit disgusted
with, ones that the sentiment so
negative that investors don't even want
to consider it. And at the very top of
the list here, we have Adobe. This is a
stock that investors simply want nothing
to do with. Just look at some of the
numbers of this company, and it shows
how poor the sentiment is. First of all,
Adobe continues to trade down. It's down
25% year-to- date. So, it's it's nearly
at its all-time low this year. But then
we zoom out even further. It's down 34%
in the past uh year. We zoom out over
the past 5 years. Adobe is down 50% from
its high. The multiples this company
trades at are one of a dying company.
One where it's going downhill. Things
look really bad. The returns on this
stock are going to be terrible is what
investors believe. They priced it at a
14-5 Ford PE ratio. They've priced it at
a 7% free cash flow yield. So super high
free cash flow yield, super low PE
ratio. When we look at the fundamentals
of Adobe, does it match the sentiment?
When we look at the revenue that
continues to grow 10 to 11%. And this
company hasn't had any sudden revenue
deceleration. So you can't even say,
well, the reason the stock is down is
because it went from 20% growth to 10.
That never happened. The performance
obligations, which is basically their
backlog of contracts, has grown by 13%.
Signifying that there's future growth.
It's not just looking at trailing
numbers. Now, we're looking at future
obligations, and it's still growing. The
free cash flow grew 47% year-over-year.
There's a bit of bumpiness here. So, on
a 5-year average, it's around 14%. When
we look at the free cash flow per share,
it's actually growing a lot faster
because Adobe makes so much money that
they're buying back a lot of shares.
what investors are pricing into this
stock seems incredibly bearish. In fact,
when we look at the discounted cash flow
calculator, this is on Qualrum and we
can just run some simple scenarios here.
We basically have four inputs here.
Super simple. We have the trailing
earnings per share that's already
entered by Qualrrim. Then we have the
EPS growth rate and this is where we can
get into some basic assumptions. For
example, we can say that we think Adobee
is going to grow at around uh 13%
earnings per share growth. Let's say
that the multiples go up a slightly just
to a 22 and we have almost a 15% return
right there. We get 14.4% returns per
year. If Adobe just continues on doing
what it's doing, buying back shares,
growing its EPS at even a low rate, 10
to 12%, this stock should have positive
returns. Next on the list is another
stock that's been left for dead. It's
one that no one wants to own today,
which is Chipotle. Now, Chipotle's had
its struggles, I'll admit. the portion
size control, the difference between
ordering in person and ordering digital
pickup. In many cases, you feel like you
get jipped when you go to Chipotle. Lots
of people complaining about the making
of their burrito. So, they have issues
with consistency, with quality. They're
trying to address that. So far, it seems
like they've made some progress, but
they haven't fixed that problem. But
Chipotle is down 50% this year. Now, I
used to own Chipotle. I sold the stock
for around $54 per share. I made around
$13,000 in gains on the company. I made
a hefty profit in the company by buying
it and selling it when there's a lot of
enthusiasm in it. And I know as someone
that has invested in restaurants for a
long period of time, I've owned
Starbucks before. I've owned uh Texas
Roadhouse. I've owned a number of them
before and they've been very profitable
investments, but these companies are
more volatile. They're ones where
investors become very bullish and very
bearish very quickly. So, this is a a
category that I think sentiment can have
very dramatic swings. What we're seeing
here is sentiment shifting to the
negative incredibly fast for Chipotle.
Some of it is justified. And that's the
problem with stock prices going down is
there always is some validity to the
stock going down. After all, Chipotle's
revenue has decelerated. So, you can see
that it was going up very quickly.
They're raising prices, opening up new
locations, unit volume was growing.
Things seemed like it was great for
Chipotle, but then we've hit a little
bit of a slow period. Now we have an
issue. Unit volume is going down. Unit
volume is a measurement of every single
Chipotle location and how much it's
selling every single year. It was at its
highest peak 3.21 million. And Chipotle
has goals to get this above like 5
million. You know, they want to get it
up to six or seven million as top tier
restaurants, but it's not there yet. And
in fact, instead of continuing on its
long-term trend of going upwards, now
it's gone down for multiple quarters. We
have three quarters in a row of it being
below where it was previously. Not a
great trend. Don't be mistaken by the
metrics here. Chipotle going down for a
few consecutive quarters is not a death
blow to the company. This doesn't mean
the product's ruined forever. This
doesn't mean they can't fix the value
proposition or the consistency in their
portions. And what's going on right now
is a huge devaluation of the company,
multiple compression. On the one-year,
Chipotle went from a 55 trailing PE
ratio now to a 27. The free cash flow
yield went from a 1.47%
now up to a 3.72%.
I think it's worth consideration. Now, I
don't know if Chipotle is the best buy
in the world, but it's one that I think
investors should have on their watch
list because if we just look at some
simple assumptions of a 12% earnings per
share growth, a 30p ratio, you get a
nice healthy 14% return from this
company. And these are very moderate
assumptions. Chipotle is a company that
could enthuse investors if there's any
good news, any sentiment shift. if they
open up and start offering breakfasts
and that boosts their earnings. If they
find a lot of success in new locations,
that boosts their earnings. Or if
there's a simple economic turnaround and
people just go to restaurants more. So,
this may be one worth considering while
the stock is beaten down. Now, another
stock that's been beaten down this year
is one of my own, which is Dualingo.
This is a stock that seemingly nobody
wants to own. We look at what's gone on
just year to date, and Duelingo is down
42% year-to date. So almost chopped in
half. We look at the past one year, it's
down 38%. In the past five years, it's
well off of its highs. Look at the highs
way up here. It was trading at 1 $530
per share. Dualingo is now at 191. And
there's reason to believe that this
sell-off may be more of a result of
other factors outside of Duelingo's
control. There is right now a continual
sell-off in any company that investors
consider even slightly speculative.
Let's go ahead and just take a look at a
couple examples. For example, we have
SMR. This one's down 56% in the past one
month. We have Oaklo. This is another
one that just went through a recent
sell-off, down 39% in the past one
month. Energy Fuels, another company
investors were super bullish on, but in
the past month, it's down 36%. We get to
the quantum computing category. Remember
that one? Investors were really excited
about it just a bit ago. Look at it over
just the past month, down 53%. We can
look at the AI infrastructure trade.
Companies like Coreweave, ones that
investors were super bullish on just a
month ago. They're now down 43% from
their recent highs. We also have Oracle
that had that massive spike after the
deal with Open AI only to trade down 26%
in the past 1 month. The stock has given
up basically all of the gains it made
from that announcement. And then we get
to companies that are a bit more similar
to Dualingo. These large consumer-led
companies, ones like Hims and Hers. This
is a company that's down 40% in the past
month. Oscar Health is another stock
that's down 31% in just the past month.
What I see here is any company that
doesn't have a wide established mode or
super high profitability is being sold
off. Anything that seems speculative
that traded up with momentum is being
sold off. So, I'm not saying that
Dualingo is like any of those companies.
Of course, there's huge distinctions,
but I do believe that there is some
similarities in the way that the
market's treating these companies. The
market is wanting to derisk. It's
wanting to exit speculative growth
stocks and Duelingo today is treated and
bucketed in the category as a
speculative growth stock. There's lots
of people that believe this stock is no
different than Candy Crush or Clash
Royale. Simple mobile game that's a
little bit addictive and it will go
through its wave of growth and
inevitable failure when the hype wears
off. And then there's the core believers
that believe it's a new category of core
education and digital expansion across
the globe. But right now it is
speculative. the story is not told. The
fundamentals are not established enough.
The moat isn't known enough today. And
so I believe that part of the reason
that Dualingo is selling off with such
aggressiveness is simply because of the
de-risking nature of the overall market.
You can look at many similar companies
that are in that speculative growth
stock bucket and they'll have very
similar stock patterns, very similar
trading patterns over the past year. In
fact, many of them went down almost the
exact same time periods. So even though
there are reasons that you could point
to for Duelingo specifically, I believe
a large part of the sell-off is simple
trading patterns and I believe when
investors have a greater appetite for
risk, we'll see something different with
this company. Duelingo is a company that
I don't need to put in super aggressive
assumptions to make this stock have a
decent return. If I use the free cash
flow for this DCF and I say that it's
going to grow its free cash flow at 20%
per year, you may say that that's a bit
high, but remember Dualingo has grown
its free cash flow at 50% per year. So,
I'm pricing in massive deceleration in
its growth. With that deceleration
priced in and only trading at a 3% free
cash flow yield, the stock gives a
staggering 27% return. Now, next we get
to a stock that has sold off recently.
Although, I will say that this one
hasn't sold off as much as the others.
It's Door Dash. This is another stock
that I've had on my watch list for some
time. Year-to date, it's up 22%, but in
the past month, it's down 25%. Now,
investors already know how good of a
company Uber is, and Uber is very
similar to Door Dash. Both of them
operate and compete in food delivery and
grocery delivery, but Uber also has a
lot of exposure to drives. In fact, just
getting rides and passenger rides is the
biggest part of their business. So, Uber
is like a primarily ride sharing
business with a little side business as
Uber Eats. And Door Dash is simply a
delivery business. All they do is they
deliver food, they deliver groceries,
they even deliver stuff from convenience
stores. If you want something picked up
fast, you don't want to go out and get
it, you can get it on Door Dash. One of
the key distinctions is Door Dash seems
more insulated against autonomous
vehicles than Uber. Uber has to compete
with Whimo in these dynamics of Tesla.
Tesla has shown zero interest in
partnering with Uber. Tesla eventually
figures out how to offer robo taxi
without a driver, that could pose a
problem for Uber. Then you have other
companies, some of which are wanting to
partner with Uber, some aren't. But
that's a highly competitive business.
It's becoming more saturated by the day.
And this creates an interesting dynamic
because although Door Dash seems like
it's less diversified, they're also not
competing as directly with autonomous
vehicles, it is true that AVs will do
food delivery, but there is no quick
second place. Whimo doesn't have some
big food delivery business. In fact,
whenever they want to do that, they have
to partner with Door Dash. So, Door Dash
in some ways may actually be more
insulated from technological advancement
than Uber. When we look at the company,
the fundamentals show a very strong
company. Revenue growing 25%. The orders
on a trailing 12-month basis, growing to
19.5%,
almost 3 billion orders. Their free cash
flow is growing at 20% per year. The
earnings per share have gone from the
red up into the green. The ad segment of
Door Dash has grown to a billion dollar
run rate. So, they have a huge ad
business built into this one. as well.
Restaurants want to advertise and kind
of list sponsored links similar to
Amazon.com and those show up above the
other the other results around you. That
ad space is highly profitable for Door
Dash. And Door Dash is investing
aggressively into autonomous vehicles
and other robotic type of delivery
services. They want to own that
technology, not abandon it. With Door
Dash, we again don't need to make too
aggressive of assumptions. Even with a
15% free cash flow per share growth
rate, which has been much higher
historically, a 3% free cash flow yield,
we get above a 10% return. And that
gives you access to a company that has
much higher potential upside if things
end up going better than expected, which
for these type of companies that are
large platform businesses, they have
ample ways to grow. Now, another company
that's shown up on my radar recently and
one that I believe is worth
consideration is not one that's going
through some dramatic sell-off. So, this
isn't a story of buying this stock that
nobody wants to own, but it's also one
that I believe has potentially a lot
more upside. It's Marcato Libre, ticker
symbol Mi. Now, this is one that's
growing in popularity within my own
community. Lots of members talking and
discussing this company. It's a top 50
stock on Qualrum in terms of people
interacting with it and researching it.
So, a lot of investors are looking into
this stock and I wanted to figure out
why. When I looked at some of the
fundamentals of Marcato Libre, I was
pretty shocked by how good this stock
is. Let's go ahead and take a look at
some of it. It is phenomenal. We look at
the trailing 12 months of revenue. This
looks fake, but these numbers are
correct. They're real. You can double
check them if you'd like. This is the
growth of Marcato Libre. This stock is a
growth behemoth. In fact, I believe
Marcato Libre holds some type of record.
I was told about this. I had to look it
up. by delivering over 30%
year-over-year revenue growth for 27
consecutive quarters as of Q3 of 2025.
This sustained performance is unique. As
its chief financial officer noted, no
other company in the world has delivered
this for such a long period of time.
It's the only company to ever do this
30% year-over-year growth rate for 27
consecutive quarters. So, it's just
phenomenal what this company has
accomplished. and how are they growing
this revenue for so fast for so long.
When I was learning about this company,
they have some unique and really
compelling catalyst to it. First of all,
just the scale of it. Marcato Libre
operates in South America and these are
areas with developing economies. They
don't have giant companies like Amazon
that's already established themselves.
So, there's lots of white space to grow
into. Marcato Libre boasts an extensive
user base with 68 million monthly active
users and rapidly increasing engagement
across both commerce and fintech
services. What I understand is that
Marcato Pago is their fintech portion.
So this is a company that's growing in
retail and they've leveraged that into
fintech. The platform claims to have the
broadest assortment in Brazil. A recent
seller-friendly initiatives such as
lowering take rates and shipping
thresholds have successfully attracted
new merchants and expanded live listings
in low ASP segments. Now that's a line
taken straight from Amazon having the
broadest selection. Amazon always
believes that people want fast shipping,
low prices, and broad selection. That's
exactly the playbook that Marcato Libre
is following. But more importantly, I
believe is their advertising segment.
Similar to Amazon again, they're
building out this fast growing retail
business. huge selection, low prices,
and then putting an advertising business
on top of that. Advertising revenue
surged by 38% year-over-year with
significant momentum in off-platform and
video formats. As long as they can
sustain any level of this growth for the
continued future, I don't see how the
stock can go down. Now, there's a couple
things to note with the fundamentals
because when we look at the valuation,
uh sometimes the valuation is just
straightforward and plain and simple.
Other times there has to be a little bit
of a nuance. For example, on the PE
ratio, Marcato Libre looks like it's a
premium price company, a 37 Ford PE.
That's in the higher end. But then in
the free cash flow, it's at a 7.7%
yield, which makes it seem like it's
super cheap. We can see this distinction
again comparing the free cash flow per
share to the earnings per share. The
free cash flow per share looks like
this. In the trailing 12 months, it was
$187.
The earnings per share in the trailing
12 months was $40. Now, free cash flow
per share and earnings per share are
never the same. Like rarely ever is it
the exact same. Typically, the free cash
flow per share will be a little bit
higher than the earnings per share, but
to a marginal extent, maybe 30, maybe
40% more. It's typically not four or
five times as much. So, why is Marcato
Libre so much higher in their free cash
flow than their earnings per share? That
is because they take on customer
deposits. So, they get that cash in
today, but they don't really own that
money. they're just holding that cash
flow for their customers. So, when you
map out the free cash flow per share and
you adjust it for the amount of money
that they're taking in in deposits, the
free cash flow per share drops
dramatically. It's a lot closer to
around 3.2%.
Now, that's not a bad yield. It's
actually good for a company like Marcato
Libre, but it's not nearly as cheap as a
7.7% yield. In any case, this is a
company that I believe is worth looking
on. It's one that I'm going to be doing
more research on and considering for the
future. Now, moving on, we get to this
market sell-off that's a bit
wishy-washy. We're going from the red to
the green and back and forth, but
overall, investors are starting to
become a little bit more concerned that
this bull market may be coming to an
end. And here we have Tom Lee once again
reaffirming that he does not believe the
bull market is ending so soon. We should
expect from time to time profit taking
because tech has been a leader for the
last decade. Um, and it is overbought.
So I think it you know it is going to be
from time to time going to show extended
weakness but to me the underlying story
driving technology which is the
productivity miracle coming from AI is
still intact. Uh Mary Erdos even talked
about this earlier this week from JP
Morgan that there's been a payoff in
spending and Lisa Sue at AMD as well as
noting that that productivity lift is
the reason AI spending is rising. That's
actually still a tailwind for tech
stocks. Tomley continues on to argue
that actually some of the things going
on today aren't a warning sign. They're
actually healthy. It's a healthy market
signal.
>> Yeah. Well, I I think it is uh helpful
to think about where we are in the in
the cycle. I know the Fed is a little
hesitant. The reason to cut in December,
but the reason they're hesitant to cut
is the economy is actually pretty
healthy and they just don't have a clear
contour of how quickly inflation's
cooling. That's a very good backdrop for
corporate earnings. actually even
corporate earnings to actually start to
spread. So if the Fed uh gives us some
guidance and visibility about you know
path forward, I do think business
confidence picks up that means that ISM
starts to recover and it is a broadening
trade. So, uh, I would agree with the
other speaker that, you know, I I like
tech structurally because of AI
spending, but there's still plenty of
room for the small caps to work, which
have really taken it in the gut as the
Feds sounded hawkish and the banks. And
so, uh, I'd be in sort of favor of a a
broadening trade as well. But I still
like tech and as you know, the AI trade
comes under question every few months.
There's always a big pullback, but but
for the last 5 years, you investors have
had to buy that pullback. I agree with
Tom that it's healthy to have a
broadening. It shouldn't be only a
couple companies that go up in the stock
market, but I also believe that there's
still going to be the emphasis on the AI
trade. Technology companies do create
the most value for society. They are the
ones expanding the fastest, growing the
revenue the fastest, and they're the
place that I'm going to have the most of
my capital. Now, we also have Dan Ies
who goes on to Bloomberg this time, and
he's even a bit more bullish than Tom
Lee. In his case, he thinks the NASDAQ
is going to continue to race higher. T
it's my view we're going to be talking
about NASDAQ like 25,000
>> NASDA like 30,000
>> next two three years. So these are it's
my view like as we continues to play out
streets underestimating numbers by 20 to
30% next few years that's why these are
opportunities to own the AI on these
pullbacks. I
>> actually believe this could be the case.
I do think that in many cases Wall
Street is underestimating the AI trade.
Many of the companies that Dan Ies
highlights, I don't agree specifically
with those companies, but across the
board, there's so many companies that
will benefit from artificial
intelligence, especially with margin
expansion and efficiency, that is not
fully priced into the stock. Investors
are so focused on capex spend that
sometimes are missing the broader
picture. Right now, I don't see any
reason for the stock market to fall
dramatically. It is true that valuations
are a bit higher. So we could see some
multiple compression but there's so many
big catalysts going on between AI
robotics between lowering of interest
rates. There's a lot of things that will
benefit stocks in the future. Now moving
on we get to news. This time it's with
Netflix. Netflix is again one of my top
positions in my portfolio. I've owned it
for a long time period. So it's a stock
that I like to keep watch of what
they're doing. In this case they've
announced games. And Netflix has been in
the video game industry doing this for
some time. They actually just announced
recently that they're licensing Red Dead
Redemption 2 for mobile. So that's going
to be part of a Netflix membership. But
now they've also announced Party Games.
And this is something new to Netflix.
>> Netflix is the home for all your
favorite movies and TV shows. And now
games.
>> Who is this?
>> Well, that's Ken Jung. Barbie and K-pop
Demon Hunters.
>> Oh, right.
>> Let's play.
>> What? Who put this trap down? Eric, I
will destroy you. If you have a phone,
you have a controller. And when game
night is this fun, you never know who's
going to crash the party.
This is different than what Netflix has
been doing with games before. Before it
was like you just kind of you sign up
for Netflix and they'll show you the
games and you might have some mobile
games. Now they're introducing it as
social games, ones that you play on the
couch with friends in front of the TV.
and the remote that you use is your
phone. So now they're not requiring you
to have any additional software, any
additional hardware. You simply have
your phone. It's an interesting concept.
I've seen this type of party game
before. I think it's another thing that
in the very least all these type of
additions to Netflix, all they serve to
do is just lower the churn, raise the
retention slightly more. Now, finally,
it's Friday and we get to another fail
of the week. This one comes in the form
of an expost from none other than
Michael Sailor, the Bitcoin the Bitcoin
leader. Michael Sailor is considered the
most highly influential emblematic
leader of Bitcoin today. He is the one
leading the pack. He's the one trying to
get every single institutional investor.
He's the one trying to get wider
adoption of Bitcoin. He's the one that
focuses specifically on Bitcoin. He's
the one that told everybody to sell your
home, sell your possessions, take out as
many loans as you can, buy as much
Bitcoin as you can, leverage everything
to buy Bitcoin. And he practices what he
preaches with Micro Strategy. He brings
on a lot of leverage to buy Bitcoin. So,
he is the leader of Bitcoin. He is the
one leading his people into battle. He
is the one that posts all of this crazy
content showing how he believes Bitcoin
is the future of finance. Now we look at
this post again and I just want to
highlight a couple things. Uh he posted
this picture recently with the title
hodal so it has hodl above it but this
is the the picture that he posted and
this isn't me changing anything. This is
his post live on X. He hasn't taken it
down to his credit. It shows the
Titanic. I believe that's the Titanic.
maybe a very similar looking ship, but
it looks a lot like the Titanic sinking
in the Atlantic while on fire. So, it's
not bad enough that that the Titanic
just sinks or this ship is just sinking.
It's also engulfed in flames. Doesn't
look good. Then you have Michael Sailor.
You have him out front looking very
chiseled. Look at that jawline. Right.
Everybody in these AI photos, that's
just a a side a side note, everybody
likes to make the AI photos, make them
look like the best self ever. Like this
would be like the best picture you'd
ever take of yourself because AI can
make you look amazing if you want it to.
So you have Michael Sailor there looking
chiseled and strong and courageous. but
he's on a life raft by himself
unbothered while a ship presumably full
of people is sinking to the bottom of
the ocean while being engulfed in
flames. Now again, Michael Sailor is
considered the leader literally the
emblematic leader of crypto of
specifically Bitcoin and he is fleeing
the ship as the captain. He's on his own
life raft and he's not even turning his
back to look at what happened. That's a
bit odd if you ask me. Shouldn't the
captain go down with the ship? Shouldn't
he be the one holding? How is that
holding? How is it holding on to crypto
to watch everybody else sink to the
bottom in the ocean engulfed in flames
while you're fleeing on a little life
raft? Uh it looks a bit like like you
got out unscathed. You're making a lot
of money and you're leading a lot of
other people to their destruction. So, I
don't know if this is the picture that
uh Michael Sailor wanted to paint, but
of course, this is going viral on social
media. That is going to be the fail of
the week. That's all for now. Hope you
enjoyed.
