And today is Wednesday, November 12th, 2025.

We are live from the TBPN Ultradome, the Temple of Technology, the Fortress of Finance, the Capital of Capital.

What's going on over there, Shorty?

You got caught lacking?

I was publishing an essay.

You were publishing an essay.

It's live on X now.

You can go listen to it.

You can also subscribe at tbpn.com.

Our sub stack will email you every morning with the TBPN newsletter and, you know, 500 words from me or Geordie.

It's a lot of fun.

Go check it out.

Also, check out ramp.com.

Time is money.

Save both.

Easily use corporate cards, bill payment, accounting, and a whole lot more all in one place.

The thing that got Geordie to learn to type was this video, this launch video.

You were like, I got to write an essay.

I got to lock in.

I got to learn how to write because this is.

This is, this is, it's, it's enraged me.

Were you enraged?

I wasn't enraged.

I try not to let the internet make me mad.

Okay, but they were trying to enrage you and the fact that they tried made you angry.

Yeah.

You got angry.

You weren't enraged.

You were below enragement, but you were above angry.

And so you had to put them in the truth zone.

You had to write a long post, an essay about it.

We'll go through it, but I'd love to watch the Chad IDE brain rot code editor.

I'm going to watch the video first.

I want to see, I want to see the video for myself.

Let's play it.

Okay.

So he's got some Newport cigarettes.

He's packing, pulls out a cigarette with the Stanford lights it up.

He's got the cutoff Stanford cutoffs.

What is this music that's playing?

He's got the, the guitar in the background and what is he playing?

Some sort of plank.

This is steak.

Oh, this is steak.

This is gambling.

So he's gambling.

And he's gambling in the ID.

Okay.

So I assume, I assume that means he's won something or other.

I actually don't know what the steak UI looks like.

Okay.

So he's done winning.

He has won the, the gambling session with steak and now he's back in his ID and he writes

a prompt and he says, test the code and it pulls up some sort of mobile game that it's

playing.

Do you, do you know?

This is clash Royale.

This is clash Royale.

Okay.

Have you played?

I have played.

Uh, in middle school.

Hmm.

Interesting.

I, I, I never played, uh, I never really got into any mobile games.

I did play, um, Paula Topia.

I like Paula Topia.

That's a good game.

It's a mobile game.

It's like age of empires, but on your phone, Elon is a big fan of it.

And with Paula Topia, actually the entire Elon universe is sort of into Paula Topia.

It's like, it's like how you gain status at some of these companies.

It's like waiting in Paula Topia.

So I'll start by saying, I think the video is funny and I'm sure the founders are smart.

Okay.

Um, and I think they, they, uh, for, for a low budget launch video, I think they did

well.

They broke through.

That is a very low budget launch video.

Yeah.

That, that literally costs nothing.

Yeah.

Okay.

So I think that's great.

Uh, and I'm not, and I, and I want to be clear that I'm not bearish on the founders.

Yeah.

At all.

Uh, but this made me think of something and I'll, I'll read through my post.

So, uh, the title of the essay that I just put out, uh, rage baiting is for losers.

Uh, this is in itself.

Rage bait.

Rage bait.

If you have been rage baiting.

There's levels.

There's sort of levels.

Um, but I said yesterday YC announced Chad IDE, AKA the brain rot code editor.

Chad is an AI code editor that allows you to gamble, watch TikTok and use dating apps

while you work on coding tests.

Yes.

Their launch rightfully got a lot of attention.

On one hand, it's funny.

On the other hand, what are we doing here and why does this belong in the official YC

account?

To understand Chad IDE, Clue.ly, Icon, Friend, and the new class of Gen Z startups, you have

to understand the online environment that these founders grew up in.

If you grew up on the internet and you studied how and why certain people would regularly

go viral, you know that making people mad has and always will be an effective way to

get attention.

The feedback loop is simple.

You make something that makes people angry and people comment, share, and dunk, and because

feeds are optimized to show posts with high engagement the most, you get a lot of reach.

Uh, rage baiting for commercial purposes, uh, in my view was pioneered by course bros,

people like Tai Lopez, realized that making the masses mad was an effective way to drive

course sales.

You could flaunt Lamborghinis, make a bunch of people angry.

And as long as a handful of people found their way into their course, it was a viable repeatable

strategy.

Historically on X rage baiting was a marketing strategy, not a product strategy.

Accounts like sweaty startup, AKA Nick Huber frequently post things to get an angry reaction

and the subsequent reach.

But behind the scenes, Nick has always been running a pretty normal commercial real estate

fund.

In 2025.

Yeah.

Rage baiting has become a product strategy, clearly started as an app for cheating on

coding interviews.

Uh, Chad IDEs only known differentiation from the other a hundred AI native IDEs is that

you can gamble and swipe on dating apps in it.

The rage bait is sitting at the product level.

Now it's becoming clear that while rage bait might occasionally work as a marketing strategy,

it really should not be employed as a product strategy.

Running a successful VC backed company requires you to build a coalition of people that want

to see you win.

Getting media investors, talent, and customers on your side is not an easy task.

Rage baiting, whether at the marketing level or product level is the most effective way

to get people who could be potential investors, customers, or team members to actively prey

on your downfall.

Uh, YC has long provided some of the most durable, high quality, generalizable advice

for startups.

And I believe that it has had a tremendously positive impact on the companies that go through

YC.

And even those that don't launch now, make something people want, do things that don't

scale, ignore your competitors are just some, some of those.

So as someone who believes that YC is one of the most effective ways to get people to

invest in your business.

One of the most important and influential institutions in tech, I believe it might be

time to include this in their list of essential startup advice.

Rage baiting is for losers.

So again, I think, uh, you know, I'm sure that, uh, I'm sure that there's like more

to Chad IDE than, than we've seen so far, but I do think it's notable that rage bait

has moved from kind of a fringe marketing strategy to a marketing strategy within tech

to now.

Living.

To a product level.

And I just don't think that's going to create a lot of enduring value for the companies

that pursue that strategy.

Yes.

So the, the, uh, the reaction to this was very negative and I think there's a few, it

really has to be.

And it also relapse.

Layer of the stack.

It ends up, it ends up, it ends up impacting the brands of the firms that fund these ideas.

Of course.

Of course.

Uh, there's a post, I'll try to pull it up here.

Let's see here.

Um, the, the most important different.

different like the most important thing in your piece that I liked was this idea

that there is rage bait marketing doing a stunt doing something a little bit

crazy but then delivering a quality product is separate from making the

product itself rage baity and so I think a lot of people yeah they saw that video

they wanted they were wondering what does the product actually do because all

you've told me is that you created an April Fool's joke and Google's been

doing April Fool's jokes for years some of these April Fool's jokes I was

looking at were insane they in 2000 just a couple years after they launched they

created a fake mind reading search engine then they did pigeon rank an

explanation that Google's algorithm relied on trained pigeons they launched

a free home broadband service so internet delivered through your toilet

they they

they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they

announced Google Translate for animals you could talk to your dog and it would

try and translate these were all jokes they were never real products it was

just the Google team having some fun on on April Fool's Day they would get a

bunch of attention and then they would route you to the safest fastest most

secure email system possible right like a real product and but they would have a

lot of fun and sometimes they would even build a little like web experience

around it but at the end of the day it was like yeah but also we're ready to

sell you servers with Google Cloud Platform we're ready to sell you like

you know

add units on Google like it was like we have a serious business and so the the

question for me and the question I had for Tyler was what's actually under the

hood at Chad IDE the company is not called Chad IDE it's called clad labs

the steel man here is that hey IDEs are boring you got to do something funny

film a funny video create a fake product but then have something under the hood

that is actually real that does actually advance the conversation and is maybe a

something that a real product would try to sign up that might need a code yeah

what will you so what happened we asked you to sign up and one thing I would say

before we go further I think this would have been a brilliant kind of like stunt

yeah if they did it as a stunt and it wasn't core to the brand that they're

building it wasn't core to the product if they did it yes if they released a

product and then later said hey we're adding this brain rot function totally

totally like that would have been that would have been like I think a good reaction if it was April

Truel at cursor or Scott Wu with windsurf we're like we're doing Brett we're doing a brain rod

version of the IDE everyone would be like that's hilarious okay now back to using word windsurfing

cursor right like that's just what yeah and I don't think it it certainly probably is not a

fit for cursors brand no not at all creating something to try to compete in that space it

would have been a good strategy but I I even but again I would actually fight you on that I I think

that cursor has this very Michael Truel has only done like a few podcasts he's he did that podcast

uh Collison he's he's this very like thoughtful software engineer Scott Wu is this IMO gold

medalist like there's something that actually would be very funny and might actually break

through if they did some silly brain Roddy stunt because it because it would be like well obviously

they're not actually doing that obviously that what they're focused on is just improving developer

productivity and instead uh this it just it hasn't answered a lot of the question of like what's

behind the curtain what's behind the marketing because if it's if it's brain

thought stuff if it's if it's jokes all the way down like what are we really doing here yeah but

Tyler what was your experience actually trying to use this product uh yeah so so I I go to the

website um you can't download yet because it's still in beta you need you need a code I DM the

founders but they didn't get back to me um but like I mean the company is not Chad labs it's

clad labs just like it's the chat ID but like this is obviously a marketing stunt I I kind of

disagree yeah but can you get a product from cloud labs like Google would come out with a joke you

know pigeon based algorithm or something like that that would be out or like Google translate for

animals would be at like animals.googletranslate.com that day but Google translate would still work so

like walk me through the clad labs product like what is their core product outside of the stunt

yeah so I I mean obviously I haven't tried it so I'm kind of giving them the benefit of the

doubt here but like when you go to the download page there's options like which brain rot do you

want yes and it's like uh you know steak or like Minecraft parkour or whatever and then there's an

option that says I don't want

brain rot okay so there is obviously a product here that is like not just it's not just the

brain right that's not the entire company yes like when you go to the pricing page it says that it

says like there's you know the free Pro uh super whatever tears it's not listing like oh this one

has the Minecraft one it says like oh it has unlimited you know agent tool use okay like

there's obviously a product here this is a marketing stunt I like believe that okay I I like

I I kind of disagree that I just say I just think it's I just think it's a poorly executed stunt and

because you have not told me what the differentiator is like how is this better than windsurf how is

this better than cursor like what is their value prop other than just like oh cool it's a newer

it's a newer cursor with less funding and the team's less serious but they're good at making

viral videos like what does that part of the reaction here that I think is you know there's

an account uh developing Valhalla is quoted the the post from YC said this is what we're promoting

instead of instead of telling young 20 year old founders to take us to the moon to create

other societies to improve the material conditions of our fellow man YC uh is funding garbage that is

only making our society worse you don't hate VCs enough so I think there's just naturally like I

just look at YC uh as as an institution that has consistently provided just very sort of like like

the best quality advice that's generalizable right for for just any any person that wants to get into

stream one live stream 30 plus destinations multi-stream reach your audience wherever they

are uh there is there's this post by shilmo not here he says met a very successful founder who

said I chose fund blank because they gave me credibility when I needed it now the fun backs

everything including the dumbest ideas I've ever seen I don't think the next wave of founders will

pick them the credibility they had is gone and I was thinking about how aum weighted brain rot or

aum weighted slop is not an excuse for

your slop and and controversial investments like if you if you put if you put one percent of your

fund into something that is just going to go all over the internet and be like we're the most

degenerate we're the craziest we're the most insane we're the most fraudulent like in your

face uh company even if it's only one percent of your fund you're not going to be able to say like

no no no 99 of my investments are just like you know trying to cure cancer genuinely or like

actually

trying to cure cancer genuinely or like actually trying to cure cancer genuinely or like actually

trying to improve developer productivity or like 99 of my investments are just reasonable down the

fairway like good businesses but one percent of them I took a flyer one percent is a little bit

crazy well if that one percent gets a thousand times more views than your Enterprise SAS portfolio

like you're going to be known as the slop fund so like you need to be careful about that yeah

because because the nature of the internet is that is that a a viral rage baby video can get

a thousand times more views than your latest

bet on AI legal services that might actually be helping improve lawyers efficiency or something

like that you know yeah um so like in terms of branding part of it it's real it's a real I see

has always had you know one of YC's challenges as an institution is that they can only accept

something like I think it's like less than one isn't it less than one percent oh yeah so super

small you know very very low acceptance rate yeah and so if you're a founder that applied with an

idea that you think is you know you're going to be able to get a lot of money out of it you know

world positive and then you see them announcing this kind of stuff they're going to be super you

know that those founders are going to be even more frustrating right I want Tyler's reaction

but first I want to tell you about privy wallet infrastructure for every bank privy makes it easy

to build on crypto rails securely spin up white label wallets sign transactions integrate on-chain

infrastructure all through one simple API Tyler what do you think okay so like as a steel man

like say that I um have some new way to do you know agents in my editor yeah and it's like it's

actually works way better than cursor it's way better than windsurf it's better than everything

I applied to YC with this thing okay there's like probably what like 10 other YC companies

that are like little YC companies in the same batch doing similar you know coding editor stuff

how do I differentiate myself I feel like this is like fairly reasonable like to get more views like

imagine I think from their opinion the idea is like okay we get some users that are think it's

like funny to gamble in their ID and then they realize like oh this is actually a pretty useful

feature and this is all assuming that they actually have good tech underneath

but like what it's like Jordy if you were in YC and you had a coding editor company like how would

you launch it yeah how do you like recommend like instead of doing stuff like this how do you how do

they differentiate themselves if cloud Labs had launched something and they were just like hey

like we're you know we're building a better ide here's how we use our model oh cursor they're

currently in a fight with Anthropic the rates are through the roof ours is cheaper for this

one reason and we have this better UI and better functionality and we also have this engineer who's a

guy who figured out this little this little solution and we work on mobile and they don't or

we work on iPads and they don't or we work for Fortran and they don't they only do python you

know there's a million ways to like articulate your differentiation they certainly it doesn't

seem like they even tried to do that it doesn't seem like they even try sure but I I think there

you could probably find companies in this YC batch doing exactly that yes you don't know their name

yes yeah yeah that is true that is true like I just go back and go back to what I said which

was which was separate out the rage from the core product and

that be like a marketing stunt I still think you could have gotten the same amount of attention but

then people would go in and they'd be like wait there's actually a really cool but I I don't think

we know for sure that they're not doing that this seems to like when I read this I see it as a

marketing but it's like like so so I I would I would agree with you if I could go to cladlabs.com

and like see the actual product but it's like cladlabs.com is not even purchased like they like

there's literally no information

okay cloud lab but I but when you go to the site it it is just like the brain rot exactly like like

where is the real product like like there is no real product here and that's the and that's what

Jordy's risk is is that is that they they they're in they haven't built anything behind the scenes

it's all marketing it's all stunt and it's like yeah doing a stunt is maybe fine even if it's

designed to enrage people it's like I I I don't know maybe you shouldn't do that maybe people are

against even doing the stunt marketing

I think it's actually okay I I think we went through this clearly like there was there was

a moment where like it was it was clearly was doing rage bait marketing and there were people

that were upset about that but there were other people that were upset about this idea of like

the product you're making is to help people cheat and cheating is bad it's like the product you're

making is to help people gamble and gambling is bad and so if you're anti-gambling you are

anti this product that they built and they and they now they have the opportunity to say

no no no like the here's the real thing and they haven't done that yet and there's no like oh click

seven layers deep in the menu and you can see that it's like oh this was a stunt for this other thing

like they haven't actually put out any breadcrumbs of like what they're actually building um and so I

I think that's why it leaves such a bad I'm going to feel like they spent all YC just working on a

stunt and I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that I I'm sure they're I'm sure

they're smart and I'm sure they have a have a have a deeper broader vision and I think

it's all you know the the reality is is like having these moments between prompts like is a

sort of is a sort of an unsolved problem 100 100 and so um yeah they it feels like it feels like

they they risk sort of going the clueless route which is over optimizing for rage bait product

development even and and then they have to like figure

out what the final product is where it's like okay I think it's okay to spend to spend you know a day

in YC thinking about like what's our marketing strategy that that video did not look expensive

to film yeah what feels what feels expensive is like it seems like they actually built the

full product like it feels like they built the full brain rot product yeah and it's like you

didn't need to do that you could have just gone viral for the video and then followed up and been

like it would have been so easy if at that end of that video been like be like

like that's what people feel like Gen Z entrepreneurs built yeah but we didn't want to do

that so we actually built this video but I'm not gonna I I want to try the I don't want to gamble

but I want to see it actually like in ID that's like funny but if they at the end they say oh it's

all a joke it's like okay it's another ID I don't need another one but I want to what do you I want

to try it you can just do window management like what are we actually talking about here just put

those two windows open right now this is a Mac native okay well let's pull up this video from

shirov Aurora who's going viral this uh yesterday okay he said tips to apply at YC batch winner 2026

and I think I think shirov isn't isn't this literal is a literal child uh it seems to be under uh uh

under I don't know under 10 years old something like that he looks very young yes he's very young

and the reason the reason that I think why I tell you about cognition

of Devon the AI software engineer crush your backlog with your personal AI engineering team

uh you want to play this video uh would you have first you should have some clear goals

I can barely hear this but okay we can pause it but the reason the reason I included this is

because I think there's a lot of people like shirov and tons of young people that look to YC

as like like whatever YC is promoting yes they

prove yes yes they give they give a lot of advice yes yes if if they're sharing something on their

social account it means it has weight it means it's a valid strategy and so I just I want to

avoid a scenario where the shirovs of the world think that they need to rate put rage bait in

order to like break out in this industry right because it's just that's not it's not the reality

you can just build a great product uh you can get let that speak for itself you can find ways

to market it along the way um yeah I mean I feel like I feel like that's part of the reason why

Gary Tan was tapped as the as the president like he he I don't know all the complex behind the

scenes stuff but he was putting out content on his YouTube channel and certainly carrying the torch of

YC forward where he was definitely speaking to the next generation of entrepreneurs in an extremely

positive way uh telling all these fascinating stories about his entrepreneurial career his

values uh I mean he hosts meetups at churches and and has really

focused on building a extremely positive Community and there is a question about the YC X account is

it a is it a portfolio list is it every company that launches or is it or is it a a library that

they're building for startup advice and they stand by everything that happens there there's there's

two different things that you can use the account for right now it feels like it's a little bit of

like hey like you know if it gets views we're going to put it up there if it's fun if somebody's

having fun but you don't always have the same you don't have the same uh like like the context

really matters like I think that video goes more viral because it's on the YC brand account as

opposed to oh some people got into YC they pivoted they came up with this funny video

like they're just having fun like they're kind of like after YC there's a whole there's a whole

era where you go through YC you hit demo day and then and then uh a few months later like there's

still a little bit of cash but they're not really building the same thing in there and it's not like

it I would not hold the YC found the YC Partners responsible for what YC companies do post pivot

post demo day where yeah the company is still a YC company uh you know you do have uh uh there

is sort of a code of conduct in YC and they can kind of kick you out a little bit uh but legally

like there is a contract where once they invest you can't just take the money back because they

think you're doing something immoral yeah unless it's like fraud uh if it's legal

like they can't just ask for the money back so uh Teddy Blank says uh sharing a video of Albie

uh who is a 14 year old applying for YC went extremely viral earlier this week got 3.6

million views wow 14 year old founder yeah let's play it I'm Albie I'm 14 and I'm based in Sydney

Australia I've been building things ever since I was six or seven don't get the joke really good

I've been building things ever since I was nine first writing code at code camps then building

Roblox games and even launching a soccer gear brand when I was 12. now we gotta hire this guy

where teens learn the real world skills that school forgot coding AI content creation Etc instead of

boring textbooks you level up earn XP and unlock challenges as you go all while learning from top

founders creators innovators and other young people doing amazing things I started Finkel because school

this is awesome how to actually build create Teddy says my default reply to high schoolers hitting me

up for VC funding is put me on the phone with your parents this is awesome I love this I hope he gets

in uh I I should recommend this guy uh this seems if he doesn't get into YC Albie will hire you yeah

head over to Los Angeles head over to Hollywood um yeah I don't this is it's interesting because

it's sort of a uh

sort of a like you're not really supposed to do this when you apply to YC like the application

video is not like they definitely don't want a game of uh like a Red Queens race where it's

about the video production yeah but at the same time like you gotta play the game on the field

like you're supposed to just turn on the webcam and basically just talk for one minute that's how

you apply to YC one shot it yeah you're supposed to just one shot at no editing because they don't

want it to turn into oh to apply to YC you spend two weeks doing an edited video they're like no

work on your product and then the marketing is like the last little cherry on top like that's

always been the YC mantra and that's a little bit of like this cloud Labs thing although the weird

thing is like the video I love the video it's funny and it's cheap and it's clearly just like

a bit and they did it and it was two seconds but then it feels like like they did products they

didn't they didn't give me the payoff of like oh okay you guys are funny and you're working on

something cool and interesting and hard and different um and so I I just feel like I didn't

I didn't get the payoff of the joke uh like the beauty of the

show's Google April Fool's Day was that that was the era when they were on such a tear you would go

and you would go to a Google April Fool's joke and then you would land on their product blog

and you would be like oh wow like they did some crazy update to Google Maps and now you can see

your house from the street because they just invented Street View like this is incredible

they were delivering on so many different levels that they earned the right to make the every the

April Fool's joke they earned the right to joke around because they also had a massive Monopoly

yeah in uh in search engines and and so they were they were printing money so no one was like oh

this is so unreasonable that they took a couple hours out of their developers time to go build

some funny gag anyway bigma.com think bigger build faster bigma helps design and development

teams build great products together get started for free um she'll says met a very successful

founder who said oh I read Joe's fund credibility we covered this what I read this one we we covered

this sorry oh sorry yeah

um yeah this was my point about about uh if you if you even if you put 99 of your AUM into boring

B2B sass or even curing cancer if you do one deal that's going to get a little crazy and go viral

like that's going to have a big impact on the fund overall should we go to more drama in the adventure

world ever Randall who's coming on the show on Friday went on uh Harry Stebbing's show 20 VC uh

and uh and is is

put is put in

over uh some comments about other funds uh I'd love to play this uh this clip from the actual

uh interview it's in a minute I don't think Ravi amant or even Ben and Mark at this point I don't

think that they can go to LPs one of those legs of the Stuhl and say hey this this basket of funds

that we're making you invest party Pes blueberries we're going to get you 5x net on that I don't

think they can say that or they at least can't say that with a straight face and if you look at the

So I think they'll be able to make an immense amount of money on an absolute basis.

But I think a lot of these LPs are in the business to make or in venture to make high

money on money returns.

Like they had PE for the low return stuff and they probably get better liquidity from

PE.

They're here for the high money on money returns.

And this is one of the reasons why I'm extremely excited about benchmark competitive position

in today's market, because we can go to LPs.

We can say, hey, we're shooting for higher than 5x net.

We have the historical track record to back it up and we have the fund sizes to back it

up as well.

And we've had miles from Carnegie Mellon come on here and do the awesome math and the very

clear math of, hey, do you know how hard it is to return 4x net on $8 billion, $10 billion?

It is immensely hard and it defies the laws of physics.

So I think there's a difference between, are they going to make a ton of money and are

they going to produce the returns that LPs really want this asset class to produce?

Two very, very different things.

But for now, the rubber won't meet the road because as you mentioned, there's just so

much global demand from LPs for exposure to private technology.

And they are happy to take lower returns.

And so I don't think there's any end in sight.

But I think on a relative basis between all of these different constituents and all these

different GPs, there's a huge, huge delta and a huge differentiation between who can

actually produce venture-like returns.

Jim O' Boo, he's not AGI-pilled.

Boo.

10x.

You're going to 10x the fund.

Just 10x it again.

Just 10x it again.

10x the fund.

Raise a $100 billion fund and 10x it.

Just 10x it and we're going to 10x it again.

No, obviously-

Jim O' Ev was on a little bit of a tangent there.

Jim O' Yeah.

He was on a little bit of a tangent there.

He was on a little bit of damage control this morning.

Jim O' He was on damage control.

Wait, wait.

So I want to hear, what exactly did he say the first line?

He says, they cannot go to LPs and say with a straight face that they can do 5x net.

Can we play the actual clip?

Because I feel like that's not quite right.

What do you say?

I don't think Ravi or Hemant or even Ben and Mark at this point, I don't think that

they can go to LPs, one of those legs of the stool, and say, hey, this basket of funds

that we're making you invest pari passu across, we're going to get you 5x net on that.

We're going to get you 5x net.

Jim O' I don't think they can say that.

Because maybe they can go with a straight face and say, we're going to get you 6x net.

Boom.

We're going to get you 10x net.

Maybe they can say that with a straight face.

Taylor knows.

Nancy Pelosi is not afraid to say, I'm going to 10x it.

I'm going to 10x it again.

I'll 10x it every day.

Then I'm going to 10x it again.

Jim O' Yes.

Ev is fighting for his life a little bit, tagging big shots, quick edits, clickbait

callouts, giving me pick me vibes.

People are not happy about this clip hitting the timeline.

People are taking shots back and forth.

What actually happened here with Ev?

Part of the reality is I don't think no fund manager can really go to LPs.

And you can share that you believe there's a chance we'll get a 5x net.

But isn't it like 99% of funds just don't come anywhere close to that?

Jim O' Yeah.

That's for sure true.

Also, I think the broader point that he's making is something along the lines of like, I saw some other posts about like,

there will be fortunes made just by getting retail investors and the broader capital that's out there in the world

into the private mag seven.

So the open AIs, the anthropics, the SpaceXs, the annuals.

There's a whole host of companies.

That was also an Ev Randall tweet.

Jim O' Oh, that was him?

Was that him recently?

Yeah.

That was, I think, yesterday.

Jim O' Okay.

Yeah.

So there is a world where you set up a fund.

That hasn't happened yet.

That has lower return expectations, but also lower risk.

And it's a great deal.

And LPs love it.

And so I don't know that it's that hot of a take.

But it certainly put the timeline in turmoil.

Christian Garrett here is sharing the gif of digging himself deeper into the hole, I imagine.

So what do you have to actually say?

Jim O' Well, so part of it is that Benchmark's feeling pretty good right now.

If you look at their 2020 fund, they have Merck.

Oh, yeah.

Jim O' They have Merck 4.

They have Fireworks.

What's the other one?

They have a number that they have a bunch of multi-10 baggers at this point in that

fund.

So they're feeling pretty good about going to LPs and saying, look, we still got it.

Still cooking.

Yeah.

And yeah, I mean, ever in Benchmark, newly at Benchmark, Benchmark has not become the

platform fund, mega-scale fund, has not 10x the LPs.

I mean, it's not the LP base, certainly.

Ev says, to be clear, I slash we love working with our friends at all of these funds.

And this part was not meant as a slight slash commentary on their quality as investors,

just POV on fund strategies and the unique value prop of Benchmark.

I think it's a fair tweet.

But it's amazing because everyone is coming out and just trashed Spencer Peterson in the comments.

They're like, I took that personally.

I run a big fund.

I'm at Co2.

We got $60 billion.

What are you saying about me, buddy?

You don't think I can put up a 5x?

Watch me.

Watch me.

I take that personally.

I'm going to put up a 5x.

I'll call you when I have $500 billion under management.

I think part of what made it feel super personal is that Harry tagged Ravi and Ben.

Yeah.

We actively try to avoid tagging people if someone is talking trash about Benchmark.

We don't really try and handhold into drama.

But it is an art and it is delicate.

Sometimes it's like, oh, wow, they're really talking trash about that person.

Sometimes it's fun.

Sometimes we've done this with Ev.

We've had Deleon on the show.

He's called out Ev and we've tagged Ev in a clip.

But it's all been fun.

We've all been chatting about it behind the scenes and then obviously had them all on the show to duke it out and stuff.

And that was a lot of fun.

This felt personal.

I don't know.

It doesn't feel that big of a deal.

But let's go to Scott Kapoor obviously speaking for his former colleagues at Andreessen Horowitz.

Now he is the director of the Office of Personnel Management.

Scott Kapoor says, since my former colleagues at A16Z are RIAs and thus cannot legally comment on what they can slash cannot say with a straight face to LPs,

this sounds a lot like what crappy board members say.

They think they understand your business in depth and make inane comments about what you should slash should not do when as an outside observer,

they have zero clue what actually happens day to day in the business.

Buyer beware.

What?

What?

I'm so confused by this.

Okay.

So he's saying that Ev thinks he understands Andreessen's business, but in fact he does not understand Andreessen's business.

But I want to know, like, what is the misunderstanding?

Because the steel man, the bull case on the Andreessen strategy is that Ev is making the claim that they will make more money, dollars, total dollars,

because they're investing out of a bigger fund size.

They don't need to go and say we're going to 5X it.

So it's a different pool of LPs.

Also part of, like, the major appeal of investing in A16Z is that you pretty much know

that you're going to get in every important company through just one, a single check.

Oh, okay.

So, yeah, maybe that's something that Ev didn't articulate fully.

I don't know.

I don't know.

That's my point of view.

I'm not an LP, but I happily would be.

And it's because you know you're going to get some exposure to pretty much every important company,

not necessarily always super early, but at some point in the company's life cycle,

it's very likely that they will take a meaningful turn.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I wonder how the RIA dynamic is playing out at Benchmark.

It seems like such an advantage in the Vibe Wars to be able to speak freely.

If Andreessen can't defend themselves because of RIA rules and Ev can just go on podcasts

and talk trash, like, you kind of win by default.

Like, you got to get out there, guys.

You got to convert.

You got to deconvert from the RIA.

I don't know.

You got to get on the timeline.

Fight it out.

What does Ev say?

He says, I think smaller constrained funds can produce higher returns in venture.

Quote, this must be a shitty board member.

Don't work with him.

Incredible non sequitur.

Thanks, Scott.

Chad Byers says, well, I actually agree with Scott in general.

My lived experience is most board members are useless.

I've been on a board with Ev, and he was consistently the most prepared, slash, useless.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

Reid, in general, my lived experience is most board members are useless.

I've been on a board with Ev and he was consistently the most prepared, slash, founder,

raved about his contributions.

And Alex Klein is saying, love you both, because they're biffin.

Interesting.

Yeah.

Smaller constraints, constrained funds can produce higher returns in venture.

That seems to be like a reasonable take, but I don't know what they're actually saying

to LPs.

Where is, wasn't Emile Michael going, chiming in as well?

What did Emile have to say?

I tried to pull that up, but the underlying post got deleted.

Oh, it got deleted?

Okay.

Well, we'll move on from it.

We'll tell you about Vanta.

Automate compliance, manage risk, improve trust with Vanta.

Vanta helps get you compliant fast.

And we don't stop there.

AI automation powers everything.

Meanwhile, over on X, people are saying, calling me unk.

They're saying I'm a boomer.

Oh, yeah?

For my post, which I think is fair.

But again, there's more nuance.

I don't know.

I like, there's a lot of it that I think is cool.

Should we have the founder on the show?

The founder, open invite to the founder.

Okay, open invite to the founder of the brain, IDE, Clad Labs.

I am actually very interested to hear what the actual product is.

I feel like the narrative,

the narrative around these rage-baity stunts is always like,

oh, don't play into it.

Don't play into it.

I'm happy to play into it.

We played into it with Clue.

We had Roy Lee on the show three times.

And what I said the first time was what I continue to say,

which is that, hey, you're going to have to build a real product.

Part of my thesis is that Roy effectively ran this strategy

as aggressively as you could.

There was a picture of him with a stripper,

Yeah, that was very rage-baity.

And that was like the peak.

And then I think he's walked it back and he's adapted his strategy.

And now he's.

And so our take was like, he's going to have to build some good software

at a certain point, a good product.

And we tried the product and Tyler churned and it just wasn't adding a ton of value.

It wasn't moving.

But now they're iterating on the product.

And now they're iterating on the product.

And so now I would imagine during the Clue Lee heyday,

I would imagine that 80% of the team's hours were spent on marketing

and 20% were spent on product, maybe.

Now I think it's flipped and I think that's very bullish.

I think that's good.

But Tyler, you had a rebuttal?

Yeah.

I mean, I would just say like, this seems very different from like,

you see the gambling on your credit card statements or whatever,

like from other accelerators, like this feels very different.

Like this is like the marketing.

Like I think people kind of tend to group all of this stuff together,

where it's like what Grant Daniel was talking about yesterday,

where it's like some of these are like immoral companies that you could say.

Sure.

I think.

I think this feels different than that.

It feels much, at least to me, it feels much more of a marketing stunt than like,

okay, this is the product we want people to be gambling while writing code.

Yes.

But, but, but what if, what if the whole, if the whole product is, and this is all,

we've, this is all we've seen is a, you know, a, a, a, a VS code fork with minimal auto-complete it.

They're always, you know, a year or two or five behind cursor and windsurf.

And yes, it has the ability to add Tinder and stake and sports betting in it.

And like that, the product that they are telling us they're building is what they're building and they stay with it for five years.

Like, what do you say then?

Yeah, then that's not good.

So, so basically you're, you're, you're just saying you're open to a pivot.

It's, it's not even a pivot.

I like, it seems to me like the company is everything, at least in my opinion, points to this being a marketing stunt.

The company is named clad labs.

It's a sad lab.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

It feels like a marketing thing.

Yes.

And the marketing stunts, it tells me that there actually is something different underneath than just adding.

Yeah, no, no, I, I, I am super optimistic about it.

I would love to see, like, I don't know, by the end of the month, we know what is actually going on here.

Uh, certainly by demo day, when's demo day?

Uh, December 3rd, I believe December 3rd, we should, we should, we should know what's actually going on, uh, with the company.

What's the real product.

So they did their stunt.

They got a bunch of people, hopefully to sign up, check out the website.

Uh, you got your early user base.

Typically in YC, you just ask your other, your other, uh, YC batch mates to try it.

Maybe you need to go broad, go viral.

Uh, you did that now build the red, draw the rest of the owl basically is the, is the prompt, uh, well, or at least, or at least, or at least say what you're planning to do, say what you're planning to do.

Uh, let's move on to, uh, or cash door cash.

Uh, uh, I haven't watched the full thing.

But, uh, massive, uh, interview has hit the timeline.

Uh, Dwarkash Patel, Dylan Patel sat down with Satya Nadella and they got an exclusive tour of fair water to the most, but the most powerful AI data center in the world.

I feel like everyone's been saying they have the most powerful AI data center.

Uh, it appears that, uh, open, uh, that Microsoft has leapfrogged, uh, Colossus two.

Uh, well, I think, uh, maybe this is wrong, but I think Colossus two will be bigger.

It's just currently it's not big.

Like.

This is the current, current biggest, it's the current biggest.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Great.

So, so you had a, you had a chance to actually sit down and watch this whole interview, uh, before we started the show.

Uh, can you give me some takeaways?

Where should people, are there any timestamps that we should pull up?

Are there any takeaways that people should know before they go and watch it?

Yeah.

Uh, I wrote a bunch of notes.

Um, so maybe some of these aren't, it's interesting, but before you take us through those notes, let me tell you about graphite.dev code review for the age of AI graphite helps teams on GitHub ship, higher quality software, faster GitHub, of course, is a Microsoft product.

So, um, so I think, um, broadly I would say it was pretty enlightening.

Um, I, I usually think of Satya as being very, uh, non-AGI pilled, and I think this was a bit of an update.

So, um, there's, there's a bunch of reasons for this, I think.

So, so early on he, like in the very, I think it was one of the first questions he's like, what is AI?

AI is basically two things, uh, this Satya is saying this there's, um, cognitive like enhancement.

So this is like your like tools, or this is your auto-complete.

This is your co-pilot, uh, yeah.

Co-pilot stuff.

Like this, and then there's like the guardian angel.

And this is like the, the very AGI pilled where, I mean, it's like kind of lording over everything.

And, and so he, he actually does like say these two things are like very possible.

Um, so, and then we kind of move on.

He says, um,

Co-pilot and actual pilot.

Yeah, basically.

Um, okay.

So, so the next thing he's talking about, um, kind of how he thinks about pricing structures of AI broadly.

Um, so there's this, this kind of conflict between, um, subscription models and, uh, usage.

Uh, model of, of pricing, um, and he says, um, I think he's broadly more, uh, kind of focused on, at least in the, in the short term on this subscription kind of thing.

Right.

Um, which like it's, he, he makes a big emphasis on this, right.

Because you need to be very specific on how you price these things because, um, doing actual like serving of the models is so expensive.

Um, okay.

So then, um, throughout the interview, he, he, he keeps emphasizing the point that like Microsoft is a hybrid scaler.

And so that means like a bunch of things.

That means that they're going to keep supporting multiple models.

Um, it means that they are going to like, they want to prioritize, prioritize the kind of long tail of like high margin users.

So you can like, you can kind of, um, compare that to Oracle who you can think of Oracle as basically.

Prioritizing one potentially low margin.

Yeah, exactly.

Power user, which is open AI.

You're, you're giving bare metal essentially to one customer, open AI.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You're betting the whole company.

And he says like, if you're going to do that, you should just vertically integrate that company.

Like you're part of that company.

That's what Satya says, like in response to like, why is Oracle basically eating your entire business?

Like you pass like five years, Microsoft was super ramping up their, their CapEx, their build.

And then they just basically stopped and let Google, uh, Oracle, Amazon basically build that up.

Um, so that's kind of the main reason.

Um, uh, there's a bunch of other stuff he's talking about.

Um, they asked him about, uh, chips.

So, uh, all the.

Big hyperscalers have their own chip play, right?

There's training, there's TPUs, um, open AI is doing their own chip.

Uh, and Microsoft does have their own chip.

Um, but it just kind of, it's like the actual production is like way behind everyone else.

It's like, okay, why is this chip so bad?

Or, or why are there, why are there so few of them?

Um, and then Satya basically brings up that like Microsoft has IP to everything open AI has, except for consumer hardware.

So chips are not consumer hardware, they're enterprise hardware.

So he's like, well.

Okay.

How do we get the best chips that the best, like, you know, model specific chips, we'll just take open AI and we'll just like build on top of that.

I wonder how much that actually transfers though, because where does the chip development live?

Where does the IP live?

Like if, if open AI.

I mean, it's designed and they can get line time at TSMC, then they can just produce it and sell it to any customer they want.

Yes.

But what if they do it within, within NVIDIA or something?

Like what if they go to NVIDIA and they're like, Hey, for the next run of NVIDIA chips, we'd like you to consider.

This architecture, why would they need to do that?

Because they want their models to be more performant on the chips.

And so they go to Jensen and say, Hey, we're, we're the biggest, we're the one of the biggest buyers.

So make the next version extremely performant for our chips.

And I think they're already doing this.

They're co-developing, uh, chips with NVIDIA.

They're co-developing chips with other companies.

And if they co-develop with Broadcom or they co-develop with, uh, AMD or maybe even Intel in the future.

And, but that IP lives with Intel, then no.

Microsoft doesn't just get it, right?

Uh, yeah.

So there, so it's like only in the event that, I mean, both of these are going to happen.

Like there's going to be internal efforts and there's going to be external efforts.

But, uh, it is, it is a funny reminder that the internal, that the internal, uh, efforts, uh, get, get copy pasted over to Microsoft.

One other, one other note, uh, Satya signaled that he's open to buying, uh, capacity from Neo Clouds, like Oracle, Nebius, Lambda, Iron, Nscale.

Isn't he already doing that?

To Fiat?

To fill the, yeah, he is.

But, but, uh, he, he, uh, Semi Analysis has a concept called like the pause, which is like, um, basically a gap of like this, like insane period of demand.

Oh, right now.

That you're trying to meet that demand.

Yeah, yeah.

Um, and Satya actually says specifically, you're right, you're rightfully calling out the pause in the interview.

Interesting.

Right.

Yeah.

And, um, I think continuing on like why he basically stopped building out.

Yeah.

Um, the, the like chip question is also like very important.

Because, um, you can think of it like if you build a bunch of data centers right now, um, they need, they have very specific like power requirements that are directly based on the chip.

Like if you're building based off the H100 chip, that's different than if you're building a data center based off GB200s and it's like there, you can't really, it's not like fungible.

Like you can't just trade one out for another.

So that, that's another one of the reasons why you don't want to basically have insane build out right now, because you think, well, you don't think, you know, that chips are going to get much better.

Sure.

Especially with like ASICs, right?

Yeah, exactly.

Exactly.

NVIDIA is like constantly, they're saying we got this next chip coming out.

Yep, yep, yep.

You want to build up your data center with those chips because otherwise they're going to depreciate and you're going to have these basically data centers in like five years that like are using, you know, the old gen chips or, or two generations back.

Yeah.

Hmm.

Anything on depreciation?

Um, yeah, I mean, so, uh, yeah, basically, um, he gives like two reasons how you can justify data centers.

Right.

Because you can have data center basically depreciating in like five years or the chips, which is a big part of the, the cost.

Um, and so there's basically two ways to like justify the actual build out.

Um, one of them is basically you can think of like research as just being like R and D spend.

So you basically just have to like, you got to do the research, like you need to do the spend basically.

Yeah.

And the other is just like, he keeps bringing this up is everything has to be like super demand driven.

So that's also why he's not, um, it's like, again, in comparison to Oracle, Oracle is basically.

You, maybe you could say that they're kind of skating to where the puck is going or trying to figure that out and then doing a bunch of debt, et cetera.

And then Microsoft Satya is saying, no, where is demand right now?

How do we fulfill that demand?

Yeah, basically.

Exactly.

If we're not fully built up, then we can, you know, lease from the, uh, you know, neoclads.

Yeah, makes sense.

Uh, I'm, I'm super excited to listen to this full episode.

Uh, the Wall Street Journal also had an article about, uh, the, the news as well.

It seems like this is all, uh, in.

In line with, uh, Microsoft's, uh, just announcement that they have a super factory.

I like it.

We went from AI factories to AI super factories.

We went from regular artificial intelligence to super intelligence.

We're ramping up, but we're still like seven levels away from the final, the final boss.

Cause after super intelligence, of course you have giga intelligence, then ultra intelligence, then super duper intelligence and, and mega factories.

Exa factory.

There's all these different terms.

Okay.

So I will say one last thing.

I thought it was funny.

Extraterrestrial intelligence factories.

Yeah.

Very sure.

Uh, okay.

One last thing.

Um, Dorkash asks, uh, Satya, like, does he buy basically the revenue growth of like when open AI or entropic says they're going to be like 70, a hundred billion in like three years.

He's like, well, you know, they have to justify their fundraise somehow.

And then he basically doesn't say much else besides that.

Wow.

Satya.

Absolutely.

Dog.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

I love it.

Uh, chat was asking about, uh, hair routines.

I think we have to comment and unfortunately disappoint because I think we both ride the

to apply the same approach, which is sleep diet exercise, baby.

Well, and no, no hair product.

No hair products.

No hair products, water and water, some sauna, some workout, some just to keep the rest

of your body healthy.

And I think that's what I'm going to do.

the hair will be healthy as well.

I actually think that's how it works, right?

No?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's just funny.

We're never gonna have a shampoo or a hair product sponsor

because we don't really use either of them.

No.

But I like creatine.

And people say that that's bad for your hair,

but it's fine.

Creatine the hair loss medication?

The hair loss medication.

People think you'd lose your hair if you're on creatine,

but I certainly haven't experienced that.

I have experienced that Julius helps

with maintaining good hair

because it's the AI data analyst

that works for you.

Connect your data, ask questions in plain,

yeah, plain English.

Get insights in seconds, no coding required.

Yeah, stop pulling your hair out and get on, Julius.

What are the other factors in here?

Microsoft spent more than $34 billion on CapEx

during its first fiscal quarter

and said it would increase its total infrastructure

investments over the next fiscal year.

It is among several tech companies

pouring a combined $400 billion into AI efforts this year

with demand.

For AI computing and companies saying

they need ever more capacity.

Very fun.

Okay, one last thing.

Another thing that I was surprised to hear

is that Satya, he made a big point of saying

that like there is a super intelligence lab

within Microsoft.

They're gonna be training their own models.

Yeah, is that Mustafa Suleiman?

Yeah. He's running it?

Yeah, and so he says maybe they'll be completely

trained by Microsoft, maybe they'll just do

like fine tuning mid training on like GPUs, and so on.

like gpt open ai models yep um but like they are gonna like actually have they're gonna be training

their own models they're doing kind of the full stack yeah when we were when we were about to go

on stage with sacha i was uh texting with doug o'laughlin from semi-analysis and uh and he was

like ask about msl or not msl uh mai mai ask about mai like what's the strategy for mai uh and we and

we asked a couple people and we got a little bit uh it was it was sort of hard to like uh really

pin down a clear strategy i don't think they were ready to really uh divulge exactly the full

strategy uh it'll be interesting to see what models they train like do they just go bigger

they have the biggest factory could they just take this uh this fair water facility and say hey let's

go let's go train something that's 10 times bigger than gpt 4.5 do they believe that pre-training

scaling laws hold or not that's what i'm curious about or are they going to do something that's

more precise like will they do a

train for excel will they do a pre-train for word or something like that is there some other

tactic that they're going to employ there's a bunch of interesting things they clearly very

gpu rich tons of sharp engineers uh tons of interesting product surface area where will

they actually go interesting times yeah i mean he talks a lot about um like application layer

stuff he actually says um like the rapper model rapper companies are basically debunked by models

getting better so i think he thinks that microsoft will basically take over a lot of that like

application layer stuff right he's he talked about excel agent a lot yeah uh there's like the the

powerpoint stuff i i so that's why i've always felt like the dynamic between open ai and microsoft is

so interesting because open ai just has massive ambitions in the enterprise they want to create

sam you know alluded to a ai native slack recently microsoft has teams imagine that it's going to be

ai native you can imagine uh open ai having like word processing excel like product you know you

theée and clouds it's all

seems like a lot for things like open ai they launched your Atlas like they could have launched like edge Atlas Microsoft could have launched like edge Atlas like the

next day and that would have been like whoa what are we doing here like that's the shot uh they could have launched like edge Atlas like the next day and that would have been like whoa what

are we doing here like that's the shot uh they could have launched like Edge Atlas褔ıridez, Microsoft likes to launch Edge Atlas the next day, and like that would have been like whoa what are we during the and that would have been like, wait, are we doing here like that's the shot.

uh they could have launched sora 2. they could put sora 2 in excel how about that

on excel excel you know they could have done that uh they didn't and so there's clearly like even

though they have access to all the ip they still have they still have a different differentiated

view on like how the products get built they're not just saying uh yo yes one copy of atlas

please one copy of sora 2 please we'll just launch our own competitor app uh they could have put in

linkedin like they could have they could have there is a way to integrate that microsoft's

clearly like not moving so fast on that front they're they're being a little bit more methodical

yeah i think this is why i'm i'm very excited to see what what comes out of mai yes it seems like

they have a lot of good people yeah um like they've been doing a bunch of like talent acquisition

stuff yes uh so i'm i'm curious if they're gonna start like like right now it just seems microsoft

is still very slow they're kind of reactive and they're like okay we should add you know another

ai

helper to excel or something but it's not like really kind of built in like low level yet yeah

i'd like to have mustafa on i'd like to talk to him about where their training models whether or

not that seems like an interesting conversation i'd like to ask him some hard questions there's

been a debate on the timeline john questions edge has every single feature that atlas has

co-pilot mode it's better than atlas or comet okay interesting maybe they don't need a copy then

they're good uh but there has been a debate over over how hard of questions we ask is it hard is it

hard to ask mustafa at uh at uh mai you know what type of model he's training or should we ask

some sort of other hard question uh i wanted to practice some hard questions i think we should

start asking harder questions i have some hard questions here for you and i think if we practice

we'll we'll become better interviews are you guys ready for these so should we just start hitting

guests with like insane i i i wouldn't call them insane i i do have one here for uh for tyler uh is

Is every even number greater than two the sum of two primes?

Answer the question.

He's looking around for Clue.

It's a simple yes or no question.

Every even number.

Is every even number greater than two the sum of two primes?

Answer the question.

Stop dodging the question.

Just answer the question.

It's a yes or no question.

Is every even number greater than two the sum of two primes?

It's an unanswerable question, of course.

It is the Goldbach equation or the Goldbach conjecture.

there's also can there exist an algorithm that decides whether any

computer program will halt or run forever it's the halting problem it's

yeah that's what about what will open AI's valuation be in 2035 hundred

trillion hundred trillion he answered that quickly we'll come back to that in

10 years see if that was a hard question what's the nicest thing ever done by

Adolf Hitler answer the question stop dodging the question carp was carp was

on a roll yesterday those clips were here's a question we should ask a lot of

founders that come on here does your dad know you're bankrupt I think if we hit

them with that that he will be like that's a hard question that's a hard

question here's one for for Tyler prove God exists there was the the go to

little

uh what what is truth that's a hard question uh have you ever done illegal

drugs Tyler answer the question no answer the question good answer who's

your favorite host me or Jordy answer the question answer the question I'm my

favorite host oh we're taking shots what is time I like these hard questions

okay uh Jordan Jordan at uh at semi-analysis is down to hop on uh and

correct if you

uh a few things we said on the article so I'm gonna drop him the he was

listening he was listening said uh Al Al in the chat where where is he uh I'm I'm

working on getting him the okay fantastic uh in the meantime let me tell

you about fall the generative media platform for developers the world's best

generative image video and audio models all in one place develop and fine-tune

models of serverless gpus and on-demand clusters you can get started um let's see

what else um Henry Kravis gave a talk the founder of KKR um the post appears to have

been deleted but I won't say who it's from but I will read it to you anyway uh the world needs

another fund like it needs enough like a hole in the head I think it was supposed to be off

the record and I think uh one of our friends was maybe live tweeting it against their uh request

or maybe uh he just corrected it and realized that he didn't want to post that but uh there are a lot

of things I suppose I I was doing a little deep dive on Blue Owl I I want to get to know Blue Owl

more it's a fascinating company uh merger there's a SPAC involved they have two co-CEOs and three

co-presidents the the the top ranks at Blue Owl are absolutely stacked from what I read uh they

are of course powering the AI build out with uh debt private credit they are a private credit

fund up there with Aries uh they've done very well they actually have three different businesses only

one of them is doing uh AI data center build out

and uh and even within the AI data center build out fund they they they fund other stuff so

um it's interesting to see um how how much risk they're taking how much their business is really

dependent on the AI build out it's also uh there was a uh they got a little they got a little battle

with uh with Jamie Diamond because Jamie Diamond was saying that uh some of these bank failures are

the fault of private credit when you see one cockroach there's usually more he's kind of

saying like hey like you know we see these defaults

we see these we see these uh these uh large companies defaulting maybe this is the start

of something bad maybe there's a lot of other bad companies out there yeah there was something with

uh Blackrock had lent I think 100 million dollars to a business recently as of like two weeks ago

they had it they had it marked as you know fully sound yeah and then the company almost immediately

went bankrupt um so concerning we have uh anyway Jordan from semi welcome to the show how are you

doing hey Jordan good to see you

again welcome back all right what did we what did we get wrong what's going on

um this is all of course uh Tyler's fault he was uh break it down give us some notes

yeah no I don't think you guys got anything wrong but um I think uh just wanted to promote that we

we put out a companion article that comes out with the interview obviously fantastic was in there he

was um he's been called out by some other people on Twitter for hunting around in the background

while they're interviewing

the Azure teams wait you're Dylan Patel you mean yeah oh we I we got to go through frame by frame

and find him like oh he's gonna go look because he's wait if we actually break down what what

does a Dylan Patel scoop look like when you're on site and security turns their back is he like

looking for like oh they're instead of this Nvidia switch they're using AMD's I've seen

him call stuff out where it's like wait a minute this company is using a different company's

technology is that what he's looking for yeah I mean I don't know if he was looking for the credo

or anything okay so those are obvious with the purple housing but if you look at his last tweet

he just said to be clear while Scott was explaining the data center uh he was super intently focused

on figuring out the fiber patch panel config we know about something we know about some providers

that have gone out and bought cables like 20 000 40 000 cables and then they they mess up the config

of the patch panel and they end up finding it too short and they just have to end them back and get

a new one oh not a negligible amount of money these these cables are uh like at least a thousand

bucks a piece yeah they're really heavy we've been talking about internally how many cables can you

bench okay there we go there we go yeah uh Dylan Patel seems like a bit of the fox who in Microsoft

is the hen house and they really shouldn't have let uh Dylan Patel into the into the new data

center because you know he's gonna find some stuff there's gonna be some scoops that like I'm sure

points like we're gonna keep him here he's not gonna look behind this curtain

like there's a bodybuilding over there like don't go don't go in that closet

and and Dylan's I'm sure on the case probably they may be you know quickly

becoming the greatest investigative journalist of our of our generation what

what like the big give us some insight on the depreciation comments yeah

definitely so there's a section of the article that kind of goes through this I

think you guys asked me this on Monday I didn't have a properly prepared answer

because I actually didn't know what Michael Burry had been tweeting about and

kind of talking about with this so maybe for background Burry is claiming that

the hyperscalers like including meta but also as your yeah on Oracle of Google or

artificially boosting their earnings by extending the useful life of the IT

assets you can see from 2020 when they would report their numbers

you can see from 2020 when they would report their numbers

these IT assets like servers switches storage would be three to five years yeah

on a lifecycle and they've now extended that to five five and a half or six all

the way across the board in some ways I think this is a bit of a you know game

of catch-up if one provider does that everybody else has to follow suit sure

but we go into detail in the article about like what this actually means and

you know Burry's argument that this is understating the amount of

of or it's boosting their earnings it's understating the amount of of

depreciation that's going on on these uh these GPUs is really predicated on

Nvidia's comments that the product cycle is now two to three years long right sure

and I think that is is like but that's on that's on the development of a new

chip like from my perspective depreciation although there is the

economic question about how much how much value can you get out of the tokens

that you sell generated by an a105 years that's a good question but that's not how we think about

that depreciation like if you buy a mechanical arm to put a glass windshield on a car at a

automotive factory you're just wondering how long until that mechanical arm breaks and and I'm sure

there's been immense pressure on Nvidia to let the chips not burn out in two years like you know

they probably have done a lot of work it's a very expensive chip it's a very expensive rack like is

it that crazy to assume that that the 50th percentile might be five years now no and

there's basically no precedent to say that a chip would fail or wear out as you're describing it in

two to three years like there's the hardware OEMs they have contracts that are standard for three to

five years and they offer extended warranties for six and seven years the big super computers in the

world that run as a total system or even individual servers kind of get life cycled they run for five

six seven some of them up to 10 years in production right not to say the years that it takes to

actually turn this thing on and and these are the

environments that use liquid cooling and some of the latest and greatest chips that are actually

you know similar in comparison to the GB 300 and then even if you go to the providers directly and

you try to rent a v100 today which was launched in 2017 right seven eight years ago I can still

rent v100s in data centers from providers like Amazon I mean there's plenty of a100s for sale

right now so there's there's nothing to me you know the the

um the proof of this argument would be predicated on Nvidia releasing chips that so drastically

outperform the current generation in two to three years that all hyperscalers everywhere are so

incentivized to go through another capex cycle they got to buy all new chips and rip out all

the existing ones and we're still so power constrained that they have to do all that and

that seems like a much farther leap than saying uh we might be able to run these chips for five

or six years in the data centers themselves

um I I wonder do you have a reaction so uh Ben Thompson's been writing about the AI build out

and the bubble potentially the benefits of a bubble and one of his like bull cases for a

bubble was basically that uh in previous bubbles you get a glut of uh IT infrastructure or or even

just you know steam engines or railroads uh but his example was dark fiber and the idea was if

you over build well then you get a bunch of extra infrastructure that you can use

and it's cheap and his his like counter to the AI build out was that uh depreciated

H100s just aren't as valuable as depreciate fully depreciated uh you know fiber lines but I just

don't know if that's true I feel like if there's a ton of depreciated H100s out there in 10 years

from now I think there's still something useful that you can do with that in the same way that

you can push bits across fiber lines it just it won't be super intelligence

there will be a base load of you know generic knowledge retrieval or just hey people just want

to chat and the fact that it's so cheap now because the assets are fully depreciated means

that you can just have a chat bot in interface every single conversation in every app and it'll

just be so much it's sort of like a Jevons Paradox thing I'm not saying that the economics will stay

the same the margins will go way down but there will be a benefit it's not like these things just

disappear after five years they don't just break yeah no they

they they don't just break I think um there are some new your comparison makes sense but there

are some nuances compared to the fiber lines just to say that um if new GPUs come along from other

providers that are so much more performant than the current ones then at some level it doesn't

make sense to keep the power turned on for the old one it's just the operating expense is too

much like we estimate this at 30 cents per kilowatt so if the bottom of the H100 price

gets below 30 cents

or somewhere close to it you're probably better ripping them out and replacing them with something

new even if you know for the car analogy this is still a beater that somebody else could drive for

the price of gas and insurance right yep yeah um yeah I was talking to Jordi about it I was saying

like there is a world where to just put in really concrete terms that most business people might

understand just uh you know if your job is you know you're you have a Diet Coke business you

deliver Diet Cokes you have a you have a you have a gas car

that delivers the Coca-Cola uh and you have the opportunity to switch to an electric vehicle uh

you you might do that because the low bringing down your total cost of ownership your annual

OpEx would be great but sometimes companies just don't want to spend the capex to actually do that

and so I'm wondering if there's a world where the GPUs get traded down to a point where people are

like yeah the OpEx is higher but I still I'm still running it for this niche use case like

there are still mainframes that are running there are still on-premise

cloud there's companies that haven't fully moved to the cloud and I'm just wondering how long uh some

of these like GPU racks might just be sitting around where someone gets it cheap and they're

just like yeah like that's the thing that filters every invoice that we get and it just runs and it

runs like it runs grok 2 on it or whatever and it's fine it's good enough yeah well I mean look

I put in the article link to Azure's announcement from September kind of pleading with their users

to move workloads off of v100 GPUs that are eight years old so please please don't get upset at us

when we turn off this instance and you you know I I don't think they're doing payroll on these things

but like things gonna shut off so interesting I I mean I totally take your point working in

IT for years there's there's so many people that come along and when there's like some sort of last

year parts for these old GPUs and they want to keep these systems running they they suddenly show

up and want to order a bunch of them yeah and it could be for all sorts of reasons but usually it's

just inertia of not wanting to move the old workloads onto the new stuff we're also completely

discounting the nostalgia Market I mean people like air-cooled Porsches I imagine that that

Dylan and you guys are going to be like yeah I need a v100 just you know sitting in the office

like I don't like this new technology this new GB you want to talk nostalgia we got to go back

to Kepler Pascal you know guys I don't know yeah yeah yeah uh what about on the what about on the

chip side uh what was most notable about uh such as comments there yeah I mean I find it fascinating

that such a clarified they have access to all IP including chips and including systems so yeah this

is on the models that everybody jumps to I think open AI has a ton of IP that's going into their

chip program that Azure could have actively take and sell as part of the cloud

cloud services if they want to partner up with Broadcom and just produce a bunch of chips that

are you know more similar to a TPU than they are to a GPU in the future yeah um they've got that

optionality I wonder if there's a way to puzzle around that though like when I was debating with

Jordi I was saying like well you know obviously open AI has a team that works with Nvidia and

with Broadcom and with you know maybe Intel in the future AMD now uh is there a world where the

IP lives with the other companies

in the next five years or something uh it seems like maybe tricky but I'm just wondering like how

much of the IP actually lives within within open AI versus the their partners well I I think it's

um so such I made the point in the podcast that in some cases Microsoft seeded parts of the open

AI chip program with IP from their Maya program oh sure so I think it's this whole mosaic of where

the actual IP sits okay but at the end of the day there's going to be something that comes with open

AI that they learn

and you can even go beyond the chips to the systems that the chips go into to the network

that connects the chips or to the software like the runtime and the like inference stack which

is to say how they run inference efficiently on these chips um there's a whole stack that

gets built from the actual hardware through to the API that produces tokens to the user in the

chatbot and uh they have access to all of that that opening I would consider proprietary

so I maybe to the point you guys were making earlier comparing to Excel or to Microsoft's

other strategies it it seems like um this is a case of open AI going really fast and executing

really quickly and their moat being speed and you compare that to Microsoft who has an existing mode

of distribution so they've got 400 data centers in Azure 70 regions free cash flow free cash flow is

a moat too yeah definitely um they've got all the makings for like you know who do you who do you

think wins the race to turning on public instances of an open AI chip that anybody can rent right

open AI or Microsoft Azure with a bit of a head start like I think they have some good optionality

there with with open AI's program with the relationship with Nvidia with Maya but the

point is that right now they are

in the race on chips to Nvidia the CPU from Google maybe AMD they use some AMD GPUs right now

so they've got to go and execute right um whether or not do you think Satya expects

Azure to compete with an open AI cloud in the next few years I think if open AI really develops

a cloud absolutely because because such a says in that article that they um well in in the interview

that

um they don't want to be beholden to one customer right I think he says like we have five big deals

with five customers and that's like the bulk of Azure's compute right now and and I would say it's

really one deal with one customer that is the bulk of the incremental revenue in Azure right now so

like I'm I mean I go hands-on testing this stuff and I've talked to 140 different companies about

actually using Azure and they were a distant third compared to just

AWS and Google from a hyperscaler perspective.

And I talked to Clem from Hugging Face this morning

and he shared some data with us that backs this up.

Like if you look at the downloads from Hugging Face

of open source models,

the downloads that originate from an Azure IP,

there's more than five times less when compared to AWS.

Wow. Right?

OpenAI can use it all with their private repos and stuff.

But if you look at the long tail of the market

where the long tail represents everybody,

but OpenAI basically,

they're getting five times less of that business right now

because they're so focused on OpenAI.

So I think Satya wants to do more than just OpenAI.

It's just a matter of actually going and doing it.

Yeah. Do we have more of a clear narrative now

on what motivated the pause?

Like you can see it so clearly

in this data center pre-leased capacity

in the semi-analysis article.

It's so obvious what's happening

from 2023, you see the blue bars just increasing,

increasing, and then just complete flat lining.

Everyone else is growing.

It seems like this piece,

this video with Dworkesh and Dylan

feels a little bit like him maybe teasing,

like, hey, I'm getting back in the race.

Like the headline with the Wall Street Journal

is like, I got the biggest data center.

That feels like I'm unpausing.

But you're not like, oh, I'm happy to be a leaser.

And oh, by the way, I have the biggest thing.

Actually, I own the biggest thing.

Like that's kind of an odd dichotomy there.

And I'm wondering if there's a clear narrative.

Was it specifically like the nature

of the OpenAI relationship that led to the pause?

Or was it just concern about the overall market

or the viability of the technology?

Or was he like plateau pilled

and had seen that GPT 4.5 wasn't getting adoption

too expensive to serve?

Like, do we have a narrative for like, what?

motivated the pause yet um i don't know if it's clear i think we have different pieces that we

can piece together um the the things that such as says in the interview point towards fungibility

diversification outside of open ai yeah uh a lack of foresight in two years ago to what the actual

demand would be they like fishtail where they went too far on building demand and then they wanted to

come back and now they didn't have enough and so now they're renting from neoclouds like um

nabious like lambda iren oracle directly they've got n scale deals i mean they're clearly using

neoclouds to take on that extra bit of risk and going forward i mean we are i think the result

is that it's incredibly bullish for microsoft actually serving this demand when they have the

first right of refusal and open ai's um growth continues to go crazy and they they are

kind of back on track to leading the way with coding models in a way that they were you know

maybe forecasted not to with anthropic coming and taking a bunch of share there they are like all in

on taking down anthropic as a direct competitor with their codex models now so i think they just

kind of microsoft just flinched a bit yeah and they're they're back on track and we're pretty

i mean we're pretty bullish on them growing in the future but it's notable that such a talks

about things like diversification around open ai and open ai and open ai and open ai and open ai and

around globally like the idea to me that there's a there's a geopolitical conclusion that you can

draw from his response on the question about the pause where he says what if i want to build in

india what do i want to build in europe what if i want to build you know elsewhere and therefore

we pause north carolina that seems to say that governments around the world can attract investment

in data centers if they implement a bunch of harsh regulations on data privacy and more and more

to train models based on personally identifiable information or other types of data that's

regulated and needs to stay in those countries and therefore you need gpus around the world

you know that could be something that they just kind of learned and therefore

pause north carolina spin up something else yeah i haven't seen that exactly play out on the global

deployments but it could be coming how real is this fungibility of the fleet thing because uh

the the narrative

around google is that they have the tpu they're so vertically integrated the deep mind and the

it just feels like when you go to gemini you get something that's like down to the metal

and then at microsoft's like pick your model and then also they're the subleasing from all

these other clouds but as as i see from cluster max like there is a wide variety of performance

metrics and results and qualitative like even like the feel of these different neo clouds and so is

there is there some sort of risk to you go to azure and they put you on the the lowest ranked

cluster max uh neo cloud and it's like i would rather be up here on the the top tier lease i

want to be i want to be sub i want to be subcontracted down to the platinum tier

not the d tier uh is there any risk to that or or or is am is microsoft actually able to

take a neo cloud that is in the d tier and and give you the azure level of service yeah i think it

depends on what level you're assessing the fungibility so i think in some ways the tokens

or the tokens produced by the model endpoints are almost completely fungible okay you know

you can find in the models on private scenarios but generally speaking like tokens from one

provider versus tokens from another provider are effectively the exact same as long as you're you

know hitting the like quality metric you need from that model deployment on that gpu yeah yeah

but if you look at the underlying architecture like when azure claims to add a hundred thousand

gp300s coming online this quarter i mean that is not fungible to every single user on a cloud

service like gp300s are rented 72 gpus at a time and 135 kilowatt rack your workload needs to be

ported to arm because it's a grace cpu um you need to have the performance per dollar benefits of the

blackwell gpu to justify it over the previous generation hopper it needs to use a gpu in the

first place such i spent a bunch of time in the article talking about the importance of

um you know in the in the interview talking about the importance of uh databases of like

you know non-gpu related services that actually run the web app that actually store the data

right turbo puffer lots of capacity beyond gpus coming online too right yeah you know i call them

cpu data centers now and they consume a little bit less uh yeah wanted your take on a couple

other things one the new anthropic news 50 billion dollar investment

uh any any any reactions to that yeah i think notable that they called out fluidstack by name

and they're not calling out the underlying providers as you said like um you know if

somebody like fluidstack can help them deliver on a a bunch of what we think is tpus deployed

directly first party um you know then there's

i mean there's all sorts of stuff that they can do because under the hood it's pretty clear that

fluidstack is deploying these tpus in terror wolf data centers in buffalo

at their lake mariner facility and uh and elsewhere in texas and then

that's cypher mining in texas if you look at some of the you know you've got to pair two new

press releases together the one from the underlying provider

and and fluidstack and then the one from anthropic with fluidstack um but the point is that

anthropic is is definitely ramping up just at the same level as open ai maybe not quite at the same

They both seem to be clearly believing that statement from Greg Brockman.

Like, if we had 10x more compute right now, we'd have 10x more revenue.

And so, therefore, their constraint is compute.

Bring it online and just keep growing.

That was certainly the case with the early iPhone launch.

Like, the iPhone, like, Apple's earnings were extremely predictable every quarter because they were like, as many as we make, we will sell.

And so, they were completely supply constrained.

But it does feel like on the question of backlogs, Anthropic has just been much less aggressive.

Like, they have been somewhat saying the biggest number every once in a while, but they haven't gotten into the trillions of backlog.

And it feels like OpenAI, Sam's almost like, oh, yeah, sure.

Like, give me all the weight of Stargate, even though that's sort of a separate entity.

And he could have easily fended that off and been like, well, that's Stargate.

That's sort of a separate thing.

That's not all on OpenAI.

Like, we need to do this.

We need to clarify, like, how this all fits together.

But Anthropic's been a little bit quieter on the, like, okay, we have this crazy RPO that's going on all over the tech industry.

What was your reaction to CoreWeave's quarter?

Jim Cramer was going pretty hard.

What did Cramer say?

He was just like, it was just a funny interview.

He was like, what's going on?

What's going on?

Because they doubled revenue, but they sold off.

Yeah, well, I mean, they sold off a ton.

Right.

Last month.

Yeah.

I think like 20, about a, yeah, 26%, something like that.

But Cramer was saying, like, why are you relying on a Bitcoin miner to, like, help fill your capacity?

Are you sure they can deliver?

And he was talking about Core Scientific, which CoreWeave attempted to acquire.

It got rejected.

But I know it was yesterday.

Platinum on ClusterMax.

That's all I need to know.

Buy and hold.

Get lost, Cramer.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And the CEO was saying, like, yeah.

And, like, he didn't name SemiAnalysis because I think the CNBC audience is maybe not familiar yet.

But he was saying, like, we're platinum rated.

We're platinum rated.

Oh, he said platinum rated?

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, that's amazing.

He was like, I love it.

Yeah.

I mean, it's in the earnings call.

SemiAnalysis mentioned, I think, three times.

There you go.

But definitely, yeah, we went into this.

We're very excited for this.

This is big.

Yeah, I think we, like, we went into this.

Jeremy and the data center guys, Rake, Dan, they put out a note earlier in the day to the core research subscribers that the core is at risk of short-term delays in their CapEx, but not to their revenue, which is driven by the data center partner, Core Scientific.

So, yeah, when you're relying on somebody to add 250 megawatts and, you know, they're only going to get you 150 by the end of the year, that changes your guidance on CapEx.

Sure.

I think the, you know, this is like.

Yeah, look, this is the reality of the industry right now, which is that when projects are so big, measured in the hundreds of megawatts, small delays or small changes in a plan can really impact, like, short-term financial guidance that people have in place.

I don't, like, personally, I don't think this changes any of the fundamentals of, like, CoreWeaves engineering or a lot of the, like, experience and what customers they have signed.

But we saw the same.

Yeah.

Like, a very similar reaction when the information put in an article about Oracle having delays, right?

Yeah.

And, you know, I think people are, people who don't know about the data center industry or things like this, they see things like, oh, yeah, these GPUs take a month to come online after they get installed and they're starting to depreciate the asset, but they're not generating revenue yet.

Like, what's going on?

It's like, yeah, that's typical.

I mean, you.

Yeah, that's completely standard.

That's business.

Yeah.

Stuff takes, I mean, you know, maybe U.S. federal government is different, but in my previous job, we tried to hand over these supercomputers to the U.S. federal government.

It'd take, like, a year and a half to pass acceptance.

But at the same time, if investors aren't aware of that and then they learn that for the first time, they could be surprised.

And so that could be something of what we're seeing in the gyrations of the public markets, I suppose.

It makes sense.

And there was a, I think there was a broad recognition that the Bitcoin miners have an uphill battle to figure out how to run these facilities.

When compared to established players like an Equinix or a digital realty or, you know, switch or something, somebody that's like has been running tier three data centers for a long time.

Yeah.

Um, it's just different.

Give us an update on the energy model that's coming.

What can you tell us?

Is it this year?

Next year?

Is it my Christmas present?

How does this work?

There's some previews.

I think you should, uh, you should have a J on the, on the program next time or bring Jeremy back.

Yeah.

We'd love to have it.

We'll talk about it.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, I, I, I'm specifically, I'm very, very interested in, uh, you know, the just American energy forecast for the next couple of years, um, because it feels like the entire industry is sort of hinging on like the trend changing, in my opinion, it feels like we're, we need to bring up the level of energy production for everything else to happen and, uh, whether we hit some sort of regulatory block or some massive scale block or a capital block or a glut of some sort.

There's some gyration correction.

There's so many things that could go wrong, but, uh, I'd love to know what the forecast actually is from the folks who have gone so much deeper.

I'll give you the quick, the quick hit.

So, um, everybody's trying to do turbines behind the meter right now, not gas.

Right.

And you've got a number of different players, but if you look at Schneider, Vertiv, Bloom, one of them, Bloom is ramping up there.

First of all, they're all sold out.

So the model will cover like how sold out and exactly, you know, exactly how it sold out.

But, um, yeah, you, you want to look at Bloom ramping up production and you want to get Schneider and Vertiv on here and try and figure out exactly why they're not.

Let's, uh, let's see, you know, what does it take to get those guys to recognize what everybody else in the industry is recognizing right now?

And then, uh, and then let's dig into solar, wind, nuclear, hydro, all these alternatives that, you know, you'd like to, you'd like to have in there, right?

Why, why is Elon putting power plants on the other side of the border and then piping?

The electricity back to his, uh, data center in Memphis because of, you know, short-term regulatory approvals.

Like there's all of that political stuff that goes on to influence this market.

I'm, I'm so excited for it.

Uh, well, uh, thank you for coming on again twice in a week.

We'll see what happens.

We really appreciate you taking the time for a three-peat if you're, if you're not already subscribed, what are you doing?

Head over to semi analysis.com by the most expensive subscription you can find, especially if you're a venture capitalist.

You can't call yourself a VC in the age of AI.

If you're not paying semi analysis, the big bucks, at least a couple hundred thousand dollars per month per month.

I demand it.

Anyway, it's great.

Nice to see you, Jordan.

Thanks for coming on.

We'll see you soon.

You mentioned turbo puffer.

I'll tell you about turbo puffer search.

Everybody serverless vector in full-text search built from first principles and objects, storage facts, 10 X cheaper and extremely scalable.

The soundboard, someone leaked their revenue recently.

And I was quite shocked.

Shocking.

Well, we have a shocking guest, Brian Halligan from HubSpot joining us.

He's the co-founder of HubSpot.

Welcome to the stream, Brian.

How are you doing to keep you waiting?

Welcome to the show.

Never better.

How are you guys doing?

We're doing fantastic.

Uh, what is the, what is the latest in your world?

Have you been captured by the AI build out?

Is this something that's keeping you up at night or are you watching it more as an observer or are you checked out entirely?

Where are you on the, the, how much does it get your pulse up?

Cause me and Geordie, it's every day for us over here.

We're in the trenches.

I'm very checked in.

Okay.

Uh, I come at it from another angle.

Um, what I've been doing for the last year is I'm like the, um, I run an in-house CEO practice at Sequoia and I do three things.

I coach CEOs, most of which are building companies on top of, uh, the AI wave, all of which, uh, I create communities of CEOs so they can collaborate together.

I have a kid's table of CEOs.

Those are kind of small company and an adult's table of CEOs and large companies.

And then I'm creating content.

So I've got a podcast launches tomorrow.

Oh, yes.

About, you know, how to be a CEO, how do you go from startup to scale up, tune in tomorrow.

Fantastic.

Uh, what, what's, what's the format?

What's the format?

Is it, is it guest driven?

Is it, uh, is it turning kind of the lessons that you talk about at the kids table and at the big kids table?

It's a six hour daily live stream.

Actually, it starts, it starts at 9 00 AM and ends at 3 00 PM makes us look lazy.

The basic thesis is like the playbook I grew up running HubSpot from 2006 to 2021.

Like a lot of those plays don't seem to work as well.

Sure.

And the rulebook, like the rulebook we thought, like, for example, I think what's how do I, Justin Wong runs this company is super interesting with 60 direct reports and no one, no one.

Some of them have very different opinions on what the game is and their opinions and kind of public criticism.

The way Eilon runs this company is empire is really interesting.

Uh, the way Brian Chesky does it is quite interesting.

And I noticed all these CEOs have kind of new place and they've got a new perspective on things.

And so I'm inviting them on kind of one by one to chat about how did you become a CEO?

How do you like your job?

What are the best practices?

What is all wrong about CEO-ing these days?

And I think it's my first guest is Parker from Rippling tomorrow?

it's a good one because parker gives all the tea on getting fired by david sachs from benefits all

the tea on the drama with deal on spy gate and then in between all that he is a very very thoughtful

ceo he's not a big fan of conventional wisdom as people know but he he's doing some really

cool stuff so that's kind of episode number one tomorrow yeah i like that framing as like focusing

on the actual job of the ceo because there's there's there's other shows that could do like

okay let's do the product review let's let's do the product announcement uh but having one feed

where you can go and actually uh understand the philosophy of a whole host of ceos that's

fascinating uh what i think i think it's kind of interesting because i was the ceo for so long so

it's like i'm really a journalist it's like a conversation about what the hell's really going

on here yeah yeah how did your approach evolve over the 15 or so years that you were seeing

ceo of hubspot i don't think it evolved that much is the interesting part you just one-shotted

you just i was basically the same guy from 2006 to uh 2021 but and i followed like ye old playbook

of the way people run companies like the bill campbell style playbook and that's what i think's

interesting it's kind of changing and that's what i'm trying to dig into and kind of go deep on

it's like stanley tucci you know stanley tucci show when he goes to italy and he's

trying to find his roots yeah i'm searching i'm going to search what are your thoughts

you want to know some surprises yeah please yeah okay a couple things

there's a there's a breed of ceo that i see a lot of these days that i call a five tool ceo

now i'm the big baseball guy and there's such a thing in baseball as a five tool player somebody

who can hit somebody can get hit for power somebody can catch somebody can throw and somebody can run

at an elite level very very rare in baseball here's who's an example here's an example of

a of a modern five tool player i mean a six tool player is shohei ohtani okay uh but he can do it

he can actually run he can hit he can hit for power he can throw he can catch yeah he's very

talented very unusual cat um alex pegman's one of those on the red some red sucks but there's a

bunch of these folks who kind of remind me of that in in theЗür места but there's a bunch of these folks who kind of remind me of that in in the зür места but there's a bunch of these folks who kind of remind me of that in in the

software industry where they've got vision, they can code, they can design, they can recruit,

and they can sell their product. And that's, I think, what's pretty rare in software. They're

all over the place now. And they're getting funded. And I work with a bunch of them.

Just a few examples, like Parker's one, for sure. Brett Taylor, for sure, from Sierra's one.

Gabe Stengel from Rogo, kind of a new company's ripping, is one. Mati from Eleven Labs. I have

no idea how to say his last name. Kareem from Clay. Dara from Delphi. Like, on and on and on.

I'm super impressed with the new breed that's coming out and how talented they are.

Who do you think the Barry Bonds of business is? Or the Mark McGuire of business? Fantastic

performance as a CEO, clearly using performance-enhancing drugs.

If somebody

If someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, you know, I don't know if you've heard this,

but Elon's actually an alien. Oh, yeah.

That puts, you know, would you guys be surprised if someone said,

it turns out he was an alien? Would you guys be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's crazy.

You'd be like, yeah, maybe.

It is funny, the performance-enhancing drugs thing, because me and Jordy have joked about how

it's not illegal to be on a stimulant. I obviously partake in caffeine, the legal stimulants, but

some folks.

It's not illegal to be on a stimulant.

Go a little bit further. But the reason that it was so controversial and so

illegal in baseball is because isn't baseball a sanctioned monopoly by the government? I believe

that's I believe that's why. And so that's why during the whole baseball scandal, the steroid

scandal, they came in and they had to do like a hearing in on Capitol Hill. It was a crazy,

crazy moment. I don't know if you track that.

I think the real reason is because they've been around for 150 years, people who broke records in

in the 1920s, like Babe Ruth broke important records

in the 1920s, that you can have like a ranking

of who's actually done the most home runs,

best batting ever.

You can't do that in basketball

because they changed the rules so much.

You can't do that in football

because they changed the rules so much.

So that's why they were so resistant

to change the rules in baseball.

And that's why they were so up in arms

about the steroid thing.

But I do think founders do the equivalent.

Like when I was growing up, I'm a beer drinker, you know?

When I was on the team, definitely had Ron.

You go to a Sequoia founder dinner,

first of all, it's at 5.30, you know, like early.

And everyone has a salad and it has water

and there's back in the room coding by 7.30.

That's definitely not how I grew up.

Do you think beer gave you an edge back in the day?

I don't think beer gives anybody an edge.

I think it helped me connect with some employees

along the way for sure, particularly salespeople.

What do you think about co-CEOs?

Yay or nay?

Okay, I think Sandhill Road is very negative on this.

Vlad Tenev-

Except on stewards.

We have co-stewardship.

Yes, we can talk about that too.

But I talked about this on one of the pod episodes

with Vlad Tenev.

He was a co-CEO for like the first seven or eight years

of the company.

And I was very surprised to hear that.

And he was very positive on it.

I think you can do it.

I think it's a little dangerous.

You better know the person very well

and be able to finish your sentences.

Like my co-founder Dharmesh and I, we weren't co-CEOs,

but we ran it like a partnership

and we thought of it like a partnership.

And the employees thought of it like a partnership.

If we called ourselves co-CEOs,

that would have actually worked quite fine.

That makes sense.

Yeah.

Want some other things that surprised me?

Yeah.

Here's the weird thing.

Two of our most successful entrepreneurs of our generation

are Jensen Huang and Elon Musk.

And they've obviously got really unique playbooks.

Like Jensen's got his 60 direct reports.

And the no one owns all the stuff we just talked about.

Elon has his algorithm and like credits the algorithm

and a lot of his success.

I ask all of the CEOs on the pod,

like who's on your Mount Rushmore?

Who do you follow?

Like, who's your inspiration?

For me, it was Steve Jobs.

Like my generation is Steve Jobs.

None of them really say Elon Musk or Jensen.

Like no one's copying their playbook.

No one, none of these CEOs have 60 direct reports

and not a single person

has mentioned the algorithm.

I think that's quite odd.

Do you?

Yeah, we actually polled YC founders

in the last demo day.

We asked probably 20 or so,

who was their favorite entrepreneur?

Like who'd they look up to?

And I was expecting like half to say Elon

and maybe a third to say Jensen, something like that.

Just like vanilla market cap.

It's a question, we didn't prep them.

We didn't tell them we were gonna ask them this.

This is off the top of their head.

And there were maybe like, two, three, four, five, six,

two or three Elons, but it was all over the place.

And it was way down the stack.

I mean, there were some people who were like,

the founder that I look up to most is like a founder

who started their company five years ago

and is a unicorn now,

but like certainly not like one of the greats.

Like obviously doing fantastically,

but like, you know, this is like a series B

or series C level founder.

And they're like, that's who I actually look up to the most.

I was shocked.

I don't even think a single person said Jeff Bezos.

I don't think anyone said Bezos.

A guy with 120 billion of 2024 EBITDA.

Free cash flow EBITDA.

Yeah, yeah.

It was crazy.

It was much less concentrated in the mag seven

than I thought it would be.

And I don't know if that's a shift

in how younger entrepreneurs or newer entrepreneurs

are thinking about what success looks like.

Like maybe the downstream critique

of like the teal monopoly thesis is that like,

it's actually really hard to go start a business

that is in the social networking category

or in the online commerce category.

It's just harder to do that.

And so maybe people, some people read zero to one

and they said, hey, I got to start a company.

But then other people read zero to one and said like,

hey, I better not, I better not set my sights too high

because realistically, how am I going to compete in,

you know, some of these monopolistic categories

that have been truly dominated by the hyperscalers.

It's going to be hard for me to go zero to one.

Zero to one in those categories.

And so I need to maybe find a smaller market.

I don't know.

Maybe it's a trend.

One of the things that surprised me about them

is they don't really have anyone

that they're really following or looking up to.

They're very much their own people.

And they're kind of making it up as they go

and they're writing the rules kind of based

on what they think makes sense.

They don't have, like when I grew up, I had two people,

I have two CEOs, Steve Jobs, Jerry Garza.

So yeah, those were my two heroes

that I tried to base my behavior around.

And they were my core systems.

These guys don't have core systems.

The other thing that's interesting about all of them

is like, be yourself, everyone else is taken.

They're all very, very, very different homo sapiens.

Like Vlad Tenev is very, very, very different

from Parker at Ripley.

Anton from Lovable is very different

than Mati from 11 Labs.

They are all quite unique.

Which I like to see that.

And they're their own people.

They have a lot of agency.

I've been-

Are you interviewing anybody

that runs their company remotely?

Nobody's doing remote.

Everybody is in the office.

Remote is dead.

Remote is dead.

And everybody talks about 996.

I think there's a lot more talk about 996

than walk on 996.

I don't think very many people are actually doing it.

The CEOs are though, every CEO I talked to

is under, like I say, what's your stress level?

One to 10.

Almost all of them say 10.

Yeah, what do you think about this idea

that a lot of companies are 996-ing in a hybrid sense?

That because the tools have gotten so good,

I mean, a software engineer can fire off a prompt at home

on their phone that will go and start doing work

that gets reviewed in the morning.

I'm firing off a DJ.

I'm firing off a deep research prompt

for something that we are gonna talk about on the show.

Yes, tomorrow.

And so there's this like ambient level

of remote work that's happening

on top of the in-person work that's happening.

And so I might, if I were to push back,

it might be that remote is not dead.

We said, yes and.

We said, let's go back to the workplace.

Let's work in the office.

And then let's also work remotely at home on Saturdays,

on the nights and weekends,

because that's what it takes to win.

And so the 996 thing has happened.

It's happening, but across two spaces.

I'm a little, I totally buy that so much work

is asynchronous now.

I just think like we went remote at HubSpot pre-COVID

and like the culture is great.

It's still great, but you lose something.

You lose, you definitely lose something.

So I'm very supportive of the enough thing.

Like if I were starting a company today,

I wouldn't do remote.

You know, your headquarters is San Francisco.

San Francisco is a bear of a place to scale a company.

Salespeople are hard to find and really expensive

and not loyal.

Developers are even harder.

And so I do a big hub in San Francisco

and then another big hub, let's say in Toronto,

where there's a lot of salespeople, a lot of developers

and be like, we're in office and at least four days a week.

I think that's a good call.

Ironically, the people who I think,

the CEOs who I think are the hardest core

are the two European founders I interviewed,

Anton from Loveable and Mati from Eleven Labs.

Like they are seven days a week.

They expect everybody in the office for seven days a week.

Those two are the hardest core,

even more so than our American brethren.

Well, the pressure on them is immense

because people have such,

so low of expectations for Europe.

So, you know, they have to deliver for their country.

It's really, it's really high stakes for them.

And they seem kind of patriotic, for sure.

Yeah, of course, of course.

Of course, they need to lead the thing.

Talk about the stewards, I want to know.

One second, I was curious,

you said the CEOs you interviewed,

all of them are the CEOs you talked to,

all of them say their stress level is 10 out of 10,

for the most part they do.

15 years running HubSpot, when was your,

like, does that resonate?

Was it kind of steady state, 10 out of 10 the whole time?

Or did you at some point figure out a motion

that allowed you to maybe hover it, you know, a seven,

which is maybe like a healthy amount of stress?

It was pretty close to 10 the whole time.

Just white knuckling it?

It was pretty stressful.

Like the whole thing was stressful.

And like the thing with HubSpot and most companies,

like it looks pretty smooth from the outside,

but it was like two steps forward,

and like one frigging giant step back,

and two steps forward, giant step back.

You're stepping in it.

And in HubSpot, like we were kind of a wartime company.

Like I like Ben Horowitz's book,

and he's got a whole chapter on wartime

versus peacetime CEOs.

All of these CEOs are wartime, all of the time.

And if they don't have a war going on,

they kind of create a war.

I thought that was kind of interesting.

It's a wartime era.

The only CEO I interviewed that is not, like, you know,

the only CEO I interviewed that is not, like,

the only CEO I interviewed that is not, like,

10 out of 10 stressed is Nikesh

from Palo Alto Networks.

He's a cool cumber.

Yeah, I wonder why, I mean.

Yeah, he's a cool cumber.

That company is, like, so secure.

He doesn't work, a lot of these guys are on.

I mean, yeah, like this has to correlate

with strength of market position, right?

Like if you are running a company

where Sam Altman's out there being like,

I would love to eat off of your plate,

I would love to launch a competitor,

and then, like, Satya Nadella is, like,

Oh, yeah, we're going to do that, too.

Like, you better be operating at a 10 out of 10.

Yeah, Sam, you're going to get cooked.

Sam competing, you know, effectively competing

with Microsoft while Microsoft has all his IP,

and he has to give him 20% of his revenue,

and he's got to pay him a quarter of a trillion

over the next few years.

He might come for your nice little startup.

Virtually every company, just looking down my list

of kids stable, adults stable,

virtually all of them are extremely nervous

about what OpenAI is going to do.

Yeah, of course.

It's a long conversation at every board meeting.

Of course, of course.

The steward thing, I'm so interested.

Like, why doesn't Sequoia just have one CEO?

Why don't they have, you know, like a super GP,

like a head partner, a named partner?

You could just rename the fund.

Kleiner was doing that for a while with Caulfield Buyers.

There's so many different ways to approach it.

They have two co-CEOs, and I think they have

three co-presidents.

You know, these names kind of mean nothing,

but they also have extreme weight.

So what is a steward in the Sequoia Capital context?

Why not CEO?

Why not president?

Why steward?

And then what does it mean to have two now?

Okay, I actually like the word steward

because, you know, Don Valentine started,

Michael Moritz, and Jim Goetz, and Doug Leone.

Like, it's been a long line of really strong leaders,

and Rulof.

They've handed it down to.

And the thing that's interesting about Sequoia,

so I've been in there for a little over a year,

is they are not at all, like, even remotely resting

on their laurels.

They are paranoid.

They are aggressive.

They don't want to blow it.

And so steward is actually a decent word.

In this particular case, I think Rulof was ready to move on.

He wanted to move on on top.

And there were just two really obvious cases.

And I think Sequoia is going to be a good candidate.

It's Alfred Lin.

He's got an incredible track record.

He runs the early team.

He's a good leader.

Pat Grady's got an amazing track record, runs a growth team.

Like, picking one of those would have been tough.

They work well together.

It's like, let's give it to them both.

And I think Sequoia has done that kind of thing in the past,

so it's not unprecedented.

And I think it's going to work well.

And they don't call themselves, they call themselves stewards.

But internally, they're like, just call us partners,

and they've made a big deal out of that.

I imagine that they go around the office saying, you have to call me,

steward Grady now, and also don't make eye contact with me.

And I will wear long, flowing robes.

No, yeah, it's just interesting, the actual aesthetics of it.

I mean, we don't need to get into the actual dynamics of the changeover

from Roloff to the co-stewards.

It's just I wonder if a co-CEO,

dynamic is sustainable, or if it is an audition process

for the final boss, the final CEO.

I mean, it hasn't worked a lot.

I mean, Netflix is doing it, Spotify is doing it,

but you can't think of a lot of examples.

And it looks like it kind of works with Netflix.

Like, that's been going on for a while, and it's doing pretty well.

I mean, Spotify is really, there's just not a lot of precedent for it.

So I don't know.

It wouldn't be my first choice.

To be a co-CEO or to fund a co-CEO.

But in some cases, it can work.

I think it's a little unorthodox.

There is an interesting dynamic where...

They call it a partnership for a reason.

You know, it's not a corporation.

It's a partnership.

And so that vibe has stretched over five decades for these folks.

Yeah.

I wonder the benefits of having two people in the same, in the role.

Like, it becomes less.

It becomes less pressure for one person,

but then you also don't have necessarily, like,

the buck stops with one person.

There's all these, like, odd dynamics.

Like, there's benefits and costs to having the...

That's right.

I think they can get a lot done,

and they can divide it up and get a lot more done.

That was the case with my co-founder and I.

Like, we divided a lot of stuff up,

and we got a lot of shit done together in our respective parts.

And I deferred to him a lot.

He deferred to me a lot.

What do they call it?

They call it monarchy, where there's two kings.

Monarchy is one key.

Duarchy is two kings.

Very rare.

How have you been processing this new wave of AI agent startups

that are, in my view,

oftentimes competing with traditional SaaS companies

that may have only been started a few years ago?

How have you been processing it?

Well, I'm involved with a lot of them.

I mean, they have escaped the gravitational pull

of the Earth's revenue.

Like, holy crap, are they going fast.

And HubSpot grew fast in its day.

And it's like, wouldn't even get a second look from a VC now.

And it's remarkable what's going on.

And I tweeted a week or two ago that, like, it's a bubble.

If you get an offer to sell your company,

you should do it.

You should take money off the table.

And on one shoulder, I'm like, it's definitely a bubble.

The valuation is crazy, 100x and whatnot.

On the other side of my shoulder, like,

I just have never seen in the history of mankind growth like this.

So maybe it's not.

I don't know.

Where do you guys come out on that?

Are we in the middle of a bubble?

Or is it just match the growth?

I think we've had a, you know, we talk with a lot of investors.

And sometimes we get a little concerned when people come on

and say they don't care at all about margins.

We worry a little bit about those clips ending up in documentaries

about, you know, whatever this moment in time ends up being.

You're either in a bubble or you're in a crash.

And we're definitely not in a crash, right?

Right now.

Yeah.

I get, I get, I get, I would say I get, like,

my concern comes from companies that spring up and are raising

because they're positioning their product as this, like, AI agent

when in reality it's hard to tell why it's going to be a better solution

oftentimes than something that looks like a normal SaaS product.

And so I just get, I get concerned because I know that the SaaS companies

in their category are, have access to all the same tools

and they have distribution and they can potentially use the advantage

they have of having this big product surface area

and a bunch of core existing product and then just compete

on all these new product lines.

And I just wonder if some of these, like, AI agent,

these more native AI companies will struggle to actually compete with.

And you've seen this.

Like, it's not like, you know,

companies like Notion, for example, didn't sit around and say, like,

no, we're not going to integrate LLMs into our product.

Like, that seems cool, but we're just a, we're, we're, you know,

a notes product and we're going to stick to handwritten text.

Like, they were incredibly quick to integrate all the best models

into their product.

And so I just don't, I don't see, like, the most recent generation

of teams, like, asleep at the wheel at all.

Yeah.

And I'm old enough to remember the last platform shift

from client server to SaaS.

And the client server companies were very much in denial

of SaaS for a long time.

I remember Oracle just being very vocal that SaaS is,

it's a bunch of BS.

And obviously, SaaS did very well.

Some of those folks did well and they, and they came across.

SAP did pretty well.

Oracle did pretty well.

Oracle did fantastic, actually.

The thing that's different this time around is all the SaaS players,

including HubSpot, were very early on it and are investing heavily in it

and are building cool stuff.

And they have a little bit of an advantage.

They have a lot of data and a lot of context,

which is really useful if you're building agents.

So I wouldn't, I don't, I think SaaS is alive and well.

And I think a lot of these SaaS companies, HubSpot, ServiceNow, Notion,

so many of them are building cool stuff.

Like inside of HubSpot, I think of it as like a platform

with applications and agents.

You can build agents on it.

You can use our agents.

And then it's got a co-pilot that you can refer to.

It's all starting to work.

People are using it.

The thing that's interesting about some of these agent companies

is they're working in areas where there weren't SaaS companies.

Like Harvey is doing incredibly well.

It wasn't really a, you know,

it wasn't an area with a lot of big SaaS companies in there.

Or Rogo selling to investment bankers.

Like a lot of the early huge wins on the agents are in funny areas.

There's a company called JuiceBox, absolutely ripping, is in recruiting.

Oh, yeah.

They're working like a big incumbent.

Like they're filling in the air.

And some of them are co-piloty, sort of be working alongside of it.

And some are auto-piloty.

And the auto-pilot ones I think will be the ones to really watch.

Yeah, it feels really hairy for Microsoft to go after legal AI

just because that's not really, they sell mostly general purpose tools.

And so if you're building an Excel plug-in where you bring an AI to Excel,

I'm worried a little bit about where that goes.

But if you're building something that, yes, ostensibly is a Word document,

but your entire business is off in this industry that's heavily regulated

and Microsoft has only penetrated with the broad tools

and has never really built a vertical solution in that category,

I feel much less worried about you being attacked from the labs.

But thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us.

This was super fun.

I'm excited for your new show.

Excited to check out the first episode.

Our next guest is Dr. Fei-Fei Li from World Labs.

She is a world-renowned computer scientist.

Thank you so much.

Welcome to the show.

For taking the time to talk to us today.

And congratulations on the launch.

Massive.

Hi, guys.

How are you?

We're doing fantastically.

I have so many questions about what you're building.

I'd like to start with why you're building it.

Specifically, what was the moment where you decided to go and start the company?

Because the big institutions haven't exactly given you the cold shoulder.

You've been associated with Stanford and Google.

And on the board of Twitter at various times.

You could be doing work inside of a hyperscaler, I'm sure.

Why did you want to build a company outside of the big labs?

Well, because we had a vision.

We had a vision we really believe in.

We believe that AI as a civilizational technology will help humans and superpower humans

in many aspects of the intelligence industry.

And one of them is spatial intelligence.

And that is something that is, in my opinion, still in the budding stage.

And our vision was ahead of most people.

And this is something that my co-founders and I really feel passionate about.

Because without this, AI or AGI would not be complete.

We want to pursue that vision and that mission.

Talk about how you think about spatial intelligence.

There's so many data primitives from GIS data, GPS data.

There's dot clouds and all sorts of different ways, even just video footage,

like what we're generating right now.

We're generating spatial data to some degree.

Where did you think the initial data came from?

Where did you think the initial data sources were lacking?

And then how did you think about building up the stack to kind of advance this

and move it a step forward?

Yeah, you're totally right.

Spatial intelligence is actually as huge or horizontal as, say, linguistic intelligence

or language intelligence.

So there is many aspects of it.

But fundamentally, I think it's deeply perceptive.

It involves seeing and understanding.

It involves reasoning.

It involves the ability to create in the mind's eye what worlds look like.

And also the fundamental ability to be able to interact with the worlds,

whether it's physical or virtual, in a very profound way.

And if you put all these together, we haven't had technology that can really do all of the above.

And we're still on the journey.

We're still trying to unlock that.

But one of the things we just have done is really putting out the world's first 3D world generation model

that is available to everybody.

And not only is it generative, it allows users to interact and create and edit.

And your question about data is actually an important one because it's hard.

Unlike language, unlike videos, unlike images,

you don't have too much 3D data out there on the Internet.

They're much more specialized.

So as a group of technologists, we actually have to just work harder.

And frankly, we use a hybrid approach in data.

Some are large-scale from the Internet.

Some are large-scale from simulation.

Some are real-world captures.

And a lot of data also comes from algorithmically processed data.

That's really important because it's just a much richer problem.

3D is a much richer problem.

So the product that we just saw, it looks a little bit like a video game.

I can imagine a bunch of different ways that this gets built into something that feels like a video game.

Or maybe there's this new trend of folks who are using AI tools,

almost as like these, they just enjoy generating songs on Suno.

Or they enjoy just creating for the sake of creating.

It's like you sell a guitar and then someone plays the guitar.

And they never commercialize their music.

They just enjoy playing the guitar.

And so I'm wondering if you have a view on is it too early to tell what your customer base

or what the user base will look like?

Are you just hoping to get this out and then see who shows up?

Maybe there's a robotics company that needs a robot.

They need a bunch of data.

And so they use your model to generate synthetic data.

Or there's people that just have fun with it.

And they wind up paying because they enjoy the service.

Yeah, I wonder if people underrate world models because they look and feel today often like video games.

And so they don't understand kind of the significance.

And so, yeah, I would love to understand.

You're so right.

Yeah.

You're so right.

I think people underrate world models because we haven't had world models.

It's not people's problem.

It's that the technology is really hard.

It's the next frontier of AI.

And like I said, this is the first time a generative 3D world model is available to everybody.

And humanity has only known one world, that which is the 3D physical world.

But now suddenly we are in a multi-universe, multiverse situation because of this technology.

So who will use it?

I agree with you, actually.

You know, just the sheer joy of the immersive experience.

For the sake of enjoyment itself is really fun.

I was just talking to a user earlier today about the VR button.

You know, we on our product click on the VR button.

It takes you to if you have a headset, you can just purely enjoy the immersive experiences.

And of course, add some favorite music of yours.

That will be even better.

But dialing all the way to professional use.

There is a lot of professional use cases.

If you go on our website, we have a page called Marble Labs.

Where we show creators from VFX, from game developer, developing world, from design world, architecture, from robotic simulation.

Even clinical research, which I personally never thought about.

Are already finding use cases.

So it's very horizontal.

But I think creativity and simulation are going to be two very large areas that people will find this really useful and super powering.

Help me understand tool use in the world model context.

So there was a moment where the large language models, the transformer based GPT-3, GPT-4.

Those models were getting really good at math.

And they were basically just memorizing math.

And you could just ask them, what's 100 plus 50?

And it would just tell you 150.

And it was sort of learning math.

And then at a certain point it broke down and it couldn't do really complex math just in the actual weights.

And so the solution was to teach it to write Python.

And give it a Python REPL and let it write some code.

And then you get the perfectly accurate math when you need that from the, not just the LLM weights, but the actual model, the experience.

And so what I'm interested in is that I've seen evidence from Genie and your model and world models generally.

There's this idea of persistence and the base model getting good enough that if I go up and I paint the wall and I come back later, the paint's there.

The model remembers this.

Maybe gravity.

There's all these things that are simulated.

But at a certain level, it feels like if I need an inventory in my game, maybe we should just use a database.

And so I'm wondering where you see tool use coming in.

To layer on top versus where you think you're on like a scaling law where if you just keep working on the base underlying model, you will get all of that functionality for free.

Yeah, great question.

So I want to answer your question in two different ways.

Because you ask a very important question technically, which is the scaling law of these models.

But then you also ask the really important question of the tool use.

On the scaling law side, the 3D generative world or just world model in general is actually an earlier technology than language models.

So we're seeing budding signs of scaling law.

But this is an interplay between model architecture as well as data.

So what I can say right now is we're absolutely seeing budding signs of it.

But the curve hasn't gotten to the point where we see LLS.

You know, yet.

So which makes the technology really, really exciting.

And being at the forefront of it, we really do have the best 3D generative world model is exciting.

On the tool use side, this is where I find it fascinating.

I think when it comes to the usage or the use cases of world model, there is a lot of professional use cases.

Whether we're talking about VFX.

You know, for movie industry or game developers.

And when it comes to professional use cases, I personally really believe that super powering creators and developers is very important.

That means it needs to give them the sense of control and agency.

You know, if you try our model and product.

There is an option.

It's prompting a result out.

And sometimes it's a slot machine.

But it's getting to be a pretty good slot machine.

I love a slot machine.

Yeah.

And that's great, right?

It's amazing.

But as a creator, in your mind's eye, there is actually so much nuance.

There is so much story in your mind.

So much you want to express.

Whether it's for a game or for a movie.

For a story.

For even like trying to get a story.

Yeah.

To get the robot to train the robot.

So we actually put a lot of thought in using native AI capabilities to allow the users or the customers to engage in the editing and controllable creative loop.

So if you're prompting something and you don't like the wall color here.

Yeah.

It will actually allow you to say, well, change the wall color from green to purple.

Or say, add this object.

Yeah.

Or say, I want to expand here.

Or allow you to stitch together the worlds that you see.

Or allow you to actually give a 3D layout.

Yeah.

So that you can put the couch where it is.

So this is very important.

And this is the tooling side of it, right?

Yeah.

It gives the controllability and agency to the human collaborator.

Yeah.

You can go.

By the way.

Yeah.

My team told me I have to put this on there.

There we go.

Wow.

Yeah.

Thank you.

You're the sweetest girl.

Love it.

You look fantastic in that.

Love it.

Thank you.

What kind of progress can we expect from World Labs on the next two, three years?

Like what are your kind of ambitions in terms of just general progress?

Oh, my God.

Two, three years.

I think.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Yeah.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years.

Two, three years is a long time.

I think they're moving so fast.

Spatial intelligence is so horizontal and it's a platform.

I do envision that Marbleware product is a platform that can empower creativity simulation.

And I think we're going to see a sea change in multiple use cases on the gaming side.

side, on the VFX side, on the Metaverse side, on the robotic simulation side, on design

side, all these are really, I wouldn't say, it's almost ripe for changes.

And we're seeing that level of excitement from many, many users now.

What game developers or platforms do you think will be most quick to adopt world models?

Because it feels like Roblox, I'm sure you've chatted with them, like Roblox should be jumping

on this because it could be something that any of their users could get a lot of value

from immediately, speed up that creative process.

But I can think of any, and some of the visuals we've shown on the screen, I'm just like,

I wish that I had world labs when I was playing.

I wish I had world labs when I was playing first-person shooter games as a kid because

you could just generate infinite maps for the games that you were playing.

You're watching this and you're like, yeah, the environments look beautiful.

I just wish I had an assault rifle in this game.

And they were bad guys.

Yes.

And if you look at our page on Marble Labs, there are shooting examples already.

So I don't know.

I think the sky is the limit, literally.

Of course.

I think what's exciting in this Gen AI era is that a lot of just creators and technologists,

many of them are individual developers or indie studios and teams, small teams, are

really jumping in really fast.

And Gen AI models like ours really lowers the bar of entry for many of these use cases.

So we're also, to be honest, we're also talking to bigger teams.

I'm actually very pleasantly surprised by the level of enthusiasm from bigger teams as well.

The team's going crazy.

Having a lot of fun.

They're actually playing with your website live.

Is it possible that we're in a world labs model simulation at this very moment?

Simulation?

Sure.

Yeah.

I'm glad the three of us are here.

After this, it's time travel.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

There is a level-

It's generated this way.

Getting back to some kind of real-

The model's getting really good.

Yeah.

I would love to know your thoughts on market structure and how things might play out because

I've been completely convinced of your vision for where we are on this technology, how early

we are and what's going to happen over the next few years is like, just the, I don't

want to call it easy wins.

Yeah.

play out the scale and you get somewhere really exciting but I'm interested in

the market dynamic so in in chat in LLM we saw sort of a somewhat of a monopoly

you know emerge a clear winner in consumer chat knowledge retrieval with

open a eyes chat GPT of course now other firms are obviously working on that and

competing then in the enterprise you have more of an oligopoly maybe emerging

between entropic gemini and and open a eyes API there's obviously a long tail

of other providers then you have the wrappers and I'm wondering if there's

going to be something similar that happens in world models is is it worth

thinking very hard about being the winner in consumer specifically and

being the winner in consumer specifically and being the winner in a

not partnering with Roblox, but being the next Roblox,

being the platform that wins consumer,

even if it means pulling back from an API business

in the short term, or is it just too soon to tell?

And it might be kind of totally different.

I'm just wondering how you're thinking

about the long-term market structure

for what feels like a distinct technology from LLMs.

That's a great question, actually.

By and large, I think it's a little bit early to tell.

So right now, like I said, we just rolled out

the first generally available, publicly available model,

and we're going to focus on being a model company

for a while, because science is still early.

We want to move fast, and there is a lot to be unlocked.

I also think that, I don't think we're a model

in the way that we are defining it,

especially in the deep space,

in the artificial intelligence way,

is as consumer, as a chat bot,

because I think, you know, like 3D is a representation,

it's a medium that has its own characteristics.

So I think that we're gonna see products

that are going to build around these models,

and I think that's going to be a big challenge

for the future of the AI,

because there's a lot of different models in different ways.

Some are for creators, some are APIs,

some are for possibly even different use cases.

And I'm not saying there's no consumer.

I actually think the market might surprise us,

especially on the metaverse side.

I think it's gonna surprise you.

I think it's gonna be a huge consumer category.

Yeah. There's a lot of work that needs to be done,

hours and hours and hours,

but I do think it's gonna happen.

And I think that it's a bit of a race,

but it is extremely exciting to even just be

on the, at the model layer,

and then, you know, experiment at the application layer,

because just today-

We've seen a lot of companies

get into the application layer.

Yes, yes, exactly.

Of course, of course, right?

Of course, of course.

Yeah, no, we're absolutely,

I mean, Marble itself is an application today.

Of course, of course.

After the SaaS app.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But we are gonna focus on model.

This is, WorldApps is a deep tech company,

and I think focusing on model

is the right thing to do right now.

Yeah.

How are you thinking about fungibility between formats?

It feels like there's maybe a uniquely,

unique value in having a world model

that can export Gaussian splat,

but then also export geometry,

also export just an MP4,

for different stages of like a VFX pipeline, for example,

something that Hollywood might wanna do.

Do you think that you need to have like translational models

or is there like one model that becomes like multimodal

that can handle all the different formats,

whether I want an OBJ file and I want a 3D, you know,

point cloud or an Alembic,

I can just get whatever I want from the same model,

or do I need specific models to translate between them?

I don't know if you have played Marble yet.

We are actually multimodal.

Yes.

We are right now exporting, you know,

Gaussian splats, mesh, mesh colliders,

MP4s and images and panels.

But is that all from one model that's trained

or is there like a translation layer between the outputs?

Is there like one foundational truth and then,

like, it's like ChatGPT is not specifically trained on,

there's not a Spanish version and an English version

and a French version.

It just learned every language when they did it.

The big pre-train.

Is it the same thing or is there actual like,

or is there like a translation layer that you need to do

in a series of different models?

What I can say now is we are a foundation model.

Marble is a foundation model.

Okay, got it.

Cool.

More broadly, where do you think AI is under-hyped

and where do you think it's over-hyped?

Oh, that's a spicy question.

The whole model is under-hyped.

There we go.

Let's go.

Talk your buck.

Just talk your buck.

I love it.

I agree, though.

I completely agree.

I think this is a deeply under-hyped category.

So, to be honest, one thing, I consider myself a scientist in my heart and I actually really

don't like hyping.

I think that's just, you probably have seen me not on the hype train in most of these

discourse, right?

Yeah.

But as a scientist, I think world model is under-appreciated because it's so new.

And in terms of overheated, I do think that Silicon Valley as a whole tend to mistaken

clear vision with short distance.

Sometimes, for example, 2006, Stanford self-driving car drove the first 140 miles.

It took 20 years for Waymo to be barely on the road as a L4, and it's still so limited.

And this is a massive amount of effort.

And it's also riding on the coattail of a very mature industry, especially hardware

and distribution and use cases and all that.

So, this is an example to show you there are clear visions.

For example, robots that can do all kinds of house chores.

And as a mom, I'll tell you that that would be amazing.

Start with cleaning my bathroom.

But that clear vision is important, but the journey is going to be long.

We have issues with hardware.

We still need to figure out data.

The world model brain of the robots also need to improve and all that.

So, that's just an example.

And also creativity, right?

Creativity industry, which we are also engaging in.

One thing, I don't call it a hype.

I call it a misleading sentiment, which actually really bothers me, is that we don't want to replace human creativity.

You know, human creativity is precious.

It tells the story of our species, of our culture, of our society, of our community, of each one of us.

What we want to do is to superpower and augment creators' capabilities.

And sometimes the communication of technology is a little skewed towards, oh, the model can do all the work in creativity.

And I personally really want to highlight human creativity as something that's so fundamental to who we are.

And AI is here to help and augment.

Can you help me understand the relationship between the current AI hardware build out and your technology, your model, your business?

I would imagine that you're a beneficiary because there's all these data centers.

There might be some slack capacity in the future.

But at the same time, I've been hearing that a lot of the LLM foundation model companies are partnering with NVIDIA to try and steer the development of the next generation of chips to be hyper optimized for LLM inference.

And that might be okay for you, but it might actually take us, you know, away from something that's optimized for what you do.

And so I'm wondering if you could just take me on a tour of what's exciting on the AI hardware build out.

And from your perspective, where are the risks?

Yeah.

So actually, I was just in London receiving this award with both the algorithm folks as well as the hardware folks for AI.

Congratulations.

Yeah.

So I think as you...

Is that an AI-generated clapping?

It's the queen.

No, it is not AI-generated.

I believe it is a recording of an audience clapping.

But Jordy triggered it from his soundboard.

That is the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering from King Charles himself.

Congratulations.

We had it here to mention to you, but I'm glad you brought it up.

Yeah, because you're talking about hardware.

Yes.

I was literally in the room with my friend Bill and Jensen.

So as you know, the most exciting thing for modern AI, for the birth of modern AI, is the convergence of hardware, software, and data.

So from hardware side, I think it's...

It continues to evolve.

For world modeling, especially our technology relies on rendering, we do think we will keep our conversation, our side of the conversation going with the chip makers.

Because some of our requirement, especially on the rendering side, as well as on the training, the model side, will be somewhat different from LLMs.

And I would love to...

Yeah.

I would love to...

I will.

And I would love to call for the chip industry to also work with us on this front.

What is exciting?

That's a great question, actually.

I'm trying to...

So I was in Middle East visiting some of the construction of data centers, and that was pretty epic, seeing how large this...

Stargate data centers are being constructed.

And it really feels that we're in a different phase of industrial revolution.

We never...

None of us lived in the days of the steam engines, the electricity, when the scale of industrialization in that time was just multiplying for humanity.

I think we are now living in the AI industrialization era and seeing that scaling up.

Gaining up is quite exciting.

Hypothetically, last question for me.

Hypothetically, if I gave you unlimited access to a one gigawatt data center, the best and brightest, the hot off the presses, the freshly installed one gigawatt data center, probably billions of dollars invested in this, would you run your...

Would you do a training run?

Would you run your...

Would you run your model?

Would you just scale up?

Or would you say, hey, I need more time to actually advance the way we think about training before we press go on the big run?

Yeah.

That was going to be my question is like, at what point does World Labs become capital constrained?

And are you capital constrained today?

Or is it just a matter of research and new ideas?

Yeah.

It's the whole bitter lesson.

Everyone's...

There's different parts of the business that are bitter lesson pilled and others that aren't.

And I'm wondering like, what pieces are currently on the great scaling curves?

Yeah.

Like I said, the scaling curve from a model architecture point of view, we're still early.

Still early.

So if I have one gigawatts and that many chips, I'm more likely going to actually run some parallel models and experiments to really hole in...

Yeah.

...the bet.

Yeah.

So it doesn't mean...

We're still training large models.

It's just not at the level of today's LLMs yet.

Yeah.

So are we capital constrained?

We are capital constrained.

I'm just going to be honest.

You got to start hyping more.

I want to see some February hype.

We're going to hit the gong.

We're going to hit the gong.

The hype gong.

We hate capital constraints.

How much have you actually raised?

How much can you do?

How much can you share?

Publicly?

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

How much can you share?

Publicly, it's known that we've raised more than $240 million.

Publicly.

Good to explain.

Why?

Why did you hit the gong just now?

Because we're increasing the hype.

Yeah.

We hit the gong for every fundraise.

We heard your capital constraint.

We hate that.

Yes.

Yes.

It's a good sign.

Well, yeah.

Thank you.

It's a mutual hype.

I'm wearing your hat.

Yes.

We appreciate that.

And we appreciate you taking the time to come talk to us.

Thank you so much.

It was enlightening.

Yeah.

Yeah.

We're very excited for you and your whole team.

Congratulations on the launch.

And we'll talk to you soon.

Yeah.

Thank you, guys.

Thank you.

Bye.

Cheers.

Bye.

See you soon.

Before we bring in our next guest, let me tell you about Profound.

Please do.

Get your brand mentioned in ChatGPT.

You reach millions of consumers who are using AI to discover new products and brands.

Let me also tell you about Linear.

Linear is a purpose-built tool for planning and building products.

Meet the system for modern software development.

I'm going to ask Kari to add this sound effect when you open Linear.

Streamline issues, projects, and product roadmaps.

Imagine.

I'm loving the new stingers.

Look at that.

That looks fantastic.

Our next guest is Scott Sanders from Forterra.

He's got some big news.

How are you doing, Scott?

What's going on?

Good to see you.

Good to see you, too.

First time on the show.

Introduce yourself.

Let us know what you do, how you describe Forterra for those who don't know.

Yeah.

I mean, first off, long-time listener, first-time caller.

I think that's actually the subject of the original TVPN printy interview.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

It's all about the product.

You know, something that happened to me the other day.

Yeah.

I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.

Thanks.

Thank you, Scott.

I think actually the subject of the original TVPN printy internet situation.

Yeah.

Where you were printing out physical memes.

That's right.

And I criticize that.

No good reason.

You criticized it?

Okay.

Well, you came around.

I came around.

Was it like we were using too many pieces of paper?

Were you...

Is this an environmentalist thing?

You were anti-printing or something?

What was going on?

No, the internet exists on your computer.

What's the need to physically print an object out of it?

Yeah.

I will put it out there, we printed your news here because we care so much, we wanted to

physically hold.

We like the Wall Street Journal, we like the Financial Times, you know, you'll come around.

We should do like a TVPN, like for every episode we plant a tree just to make sure that we're

replacing.

But I feel like we're kindred spirits.

You work on physical things, we work in the physical realm.

Of course, there is a software element to everything that both of us do, but give us

the update on what you're building because it does touch the physical realm, correct?

That is true.

We do build hardware.

Yeah, we announced a $238 million Series C today.

I think there's a sound effect happening.

There we go.

Congratulations.

There we go.

Massive.

That's fantastic.

Yeah, but we're building distributed systems for defense starting from the ground

up.

You know, we feel the warfighter, you know, you need drones, you need maritime capabilities.

There's great companies building that, but we're focused on building stuff that primarily

goes on vehicles because at the end of the day, you know, try not to walk into combat

if at all possible.

And we want to be able to equip those warfighters with technology and distributed compute at

the tactical edge that enables vehicles to be self-driving, act as communication nodes

and relays, launch things like loitering munitions, put radars into place.

You know, detect aircraft or detect enemy shipping and then put anything from cruise

missiles to anti-ship ballistic missiles in the back so that we can deter our enemies

from invading countries and want them to invade.

Yeah, my mental model for this stuff is a little hazy.

Maybe you can help clean it up.

I feel like there's usually like one company that does just autonomy.

There might be another that's doing some sort of battlefield tactical mapping.

Some awareness things.

It sounds like you're doing multiple.

How do you actually interface with the other touch points?

I mean, who do you need to integrate with?

Since some people might be familiar with maybe what Palantir builds or what Anduril's built

on the operating system level.

Can you give me some concrete examples of like groups that you're working with or technologies

or platforms that you're building on?

What's the wheelhouse case study?

Yeah, and on top of that, I feel like the challenge from a product roadmap standpoint

and product planning standpoint is you have to understand what are the systems that we

have in place in our armed forces today and then how the battlefield is actually changing.

We've heard from other people on the show that a lot of the equipment that we have might

not be relevant in a world where the front line is just drone on drone action.

Yeah, I think one of the best examples of doing this is actually with one of our partners,

Raytheon.

We're in this case Chaos in that quick little snippet where with Raytheon, we and Oshkosh,

we integrated our edge compute platform and our self-driving software to take a traditionally

manned vehicle and make it unmanned.

So one, by putting the edge compute on self-driving vehicles, you're enabling other algorithms

and other platforms to run on top of them.

So we think about the ecosystem as a partnership approach where we're not going to make everything

that a warfighter needs.

In fact, no defense company, defense tech or otherwise, can do that.

And so we open up our architecture and our systems so that a Palantir can run at the

tactical edge, not on a giant server rack somewhere.

Or in the case of the small multi-purpose equipment transports that you're looking at,

we put Chaos' long range bi-static radar system on it to detect drones and our future integrations

with those guys will enable them to utilize our compute and our autonomy later.

We don't care.

Who cares?

Who's doing the C2?

We obviously do our own because you kind of have to.

But if that's Andrew's Lattice or Palantir's Gaia or Smart System, we're very open to that.

And we've broken up our system in a way that enables the user to sort of make the decision

of what capability they want for each different application layer and not wrapping it all

into one holistic platform, unless that's what the end user and the customer want to

do.

What was yours or the team's role?

What was yours or the team's role?

Yeah.

So we're really excited to hear your comments on the project and the product as well, if

you're interested.

I thought it was brilliant.

Yeah.

Your feedback, I actually had a huge reaction to Pete Hegseth's speech last Friday.

We had Kathryn Boyle from Andreessen on talking about how Hegseth was basically making a case

that, was it Cheney made back in 2001?

So these are basically reforms that have been, people have been asking for for a long time,

but we haven't been able to actually deliver.

Yeah.

We were lucky enough to be at that event.

Yeah.

And you know, Defense Tech Reforms.

Defense tech reform is a thing people have been talking about since before defense tech was a thing.

The acquisition system has become extremely complicated and, I think, difficult to work with for many companies.

And to have a secretary of war coming out and saying, look, this is an actual problem, right?

The rate limiting step on getting technology to operators is very rarely whether there's the technology that exists that can solve the problem.

It's can it work its way through the prototyping into production phases and get into scale production with an end user?

And that's been very hard.

Palantir's been at this for 20 years.

Andrel's been at this since 2017.

And definitely not going to do that math in public.

It'll be quite easy to do.

I'm a math guy.

He's a growth guy.

That's amazing.

Speaking of growth, how is the company growing?

I mean, we...

We've texted about this.

It's all SBIRs, right?

Yeah, it's all SIBRs all day long.

Actually, no, too big for SBIRs now, which is great.

We're about about 550 people total.

And so, you know, we're not still not that big in defense tech or defense world, still relatively small.

Yeah, I'm trying to be a scrappy startup and, you know, work with not only the legacy primes who build incredible systems, right?

There's no one in defense.

I'm building eight by eight, 25,000 pound armored vehicles that can go head to head with, you know, major land forces across Europe.

And there's only a couple of small startups that are starting to do the missile systems that we want to put on the back of these platforms.

But our approach is we open up and enable our architecture to work with nearly anyone to deliver that capability at the tactical edge.

We really just feel like humans being the blunting force of combat is a pretty bad idea.

Yeah.

I mean, probably 20%.

Veterans at Fort Terra and a lot of us feel very strongly and very passionately that I would much rather have a robot make first contact with the enemy or be the platform that is emitting a large signature on the battlefield, something firing a missile, firing a howitzer, moving a radar.

So the platform is inevitably targeted.

It's not a human that's getting targeted.

It's a machine.

And we're trying to change that dynamic, you know, one platform, one program at a time.

Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.

And thank you to all the veterans.

It was Veterans Day yesterday.

Right.

And thanks, everyone, for their service.

And congratulations on all the progress and congratulations on the Series C.

And next time you come on, we will not print out your news.

We'll just go in blind.

Yeah, we'll just go in blind.

Because we don't know how to use computers.

As long as the next time isn't at 1030 at night, I'll be stoked.

Wait, are you in Lisbon right now?

Where are you?

Were you guys at Web Summit?

Josh is at Web Summit.

I'm in Paris at Tech Talk.

I'm in with some customers.

Okay, cool.

Awesome.

Yeah, we can coordinate better on the time.

Congrats to the whole team on the progress.

Yeah, awesome.

We'll talk to you soon.

Have a good day.

See ya.

Our next guest is Jamie Allaire from Circle.

Just had earnings.

Welcome to the show, Jamie.

How are you doing?

Good to see you.

What's happening?

I'm great.

Good to see you guys.

Welcome back.

Fantastic.

Welcome back.

Thank you.

Give us the rundown.

What's the latest in your world?

Yeah, well, this morning we announced our Q3 earnings.

It was a tremendous quarter.

We saw USDC grow 108% year on year, which is fantastic.

The amount of activity happening on-chain with USDC grew about 600% year over year to $9.6 trillion of on-chain.

That's an incredible time for us.

It's an incredible number.

It's a tremendous number.

It's a tremendous number for us.

Yeah, it's a tremendous number.

It's a tremendous number.

It's a tremendous number.

I think we've hit the gong for various countries' GDPs.

I think we've hit the gong for various countries' GDPs.

I think we might have hit for our GDP once, but that's it.

The only thing that's bigger.

The transaction volume.

That is, yeah, that is remarkable.

That's a lot.

Of course, that's the nature of these networks.

Yeah, and yeah, a lot of other great stuff.

I mean, we launched something called CPN, which is an on-chain money movement and payment

network earlier this year.

is growing very fast. Dozens of financial institutions coming on that network. It's

already gotten to an annualized payment volume of about $3.4 billion. Key, though, just from a

financials perspective, we saw adjusted EBITDA grow 78% to $166 million in the quarter. That's

a 57% adjusted EBITDA margin, which is about 730 basis point expansion. And so, strong performance

on that as well. And then I think really importantly, we recently launched ARK into

Testnet. And ARK is a new layer one blockchain network that Circle has been building into the

market. We had over 100 major companies, major banks, payment system operators like Visa and

MasterCard, major AI companies, major exchanges, e-commerce companies, gig economy companies,

all these working with us, collaborating us to deliver ARK. And we also announced this morning

that we're exploring

a token, a native token for ARK Network, which is an exciting development for us as well.

And so, we're seeing a lot of activity in the space. We had the Genius Act pass recently,

and so we're also just starting to see more and more major institutions, major financial firms,

payments companies getting in the game and collaborating with us and building products

with us as well. Can you tell me anything about the Anthropic relationship?

There's this very interesting concept of using stable coins to power agents in the future.

There's that. And then there's also just like Anthropic might need to pay someone internationally.

Can you give me any guidance on where we are on that?

Yeah. I mean, look, a couple of things on that. I think the first is that

we've been working alongside others on these standards for agentic payments.

Like MCP, which does not have stable coins yet, but it should.

MCP does not have stable coins yet, but it should.

MCP does not have stable coins yet, but it should.

It may be in V2 or something that you brought up.

Well, yeah. And standards like X402 and Google's agent to payment standard,

we're collaborating on both of those. Cool.

We're releasing tools for those. And we actually have a number of agent developer tools,

companies that are supporting these things as well. And so, that's actually happening.

It's actually one of the key design centers for the ARK blockchain network that we're building,

which is we envision a world where over time, the velocity of money increases and more and more of

our economic activity is machine-intermediated. And that machine intermediation is going to be

in these new computing networks, these provable, trusted computing networks, which we call

blockchain networks. And AI agents will become, we believe, the primary intermediary that's

intermediating activity on these. And so, we see that as sort of, if you look at these trends

converging over the coming several years, we see these kind of compounding each other. And so,

yeah, we were excited to have Anthropic as a

collaborating partner for us with ARK. And I think we had a number of other

AI-focused firms there too. And I think it just speaks to the fact that

we need a substrate, we need an execution environment that AI agents can use that are

trustworthy, provable. And look, AI agents need to be able to make a five-cent transaction for

consuming some tokens or a $50 transaction. It needs to work anywhere in the world where

software works. And that's what these

these new networks are really good at. And so, there's not a payment system that's ever

really been built to support that. And I think something like USDC and then these new networks

like ARK Network and standards like X402 and others really help with that a lot.

Soterios Johnson, Talk about just like the strategy of going full

stack and how you guys are positioned against competition at the different levels. You guys

are an issuer, you're building your own network, you're going to have a native token,

There's Tunt.

Nowadays, it feels like there's probably a new stablecoin that gets created every second of every day, right?

Not just a net new of an existing stablecoin, but an entirely new stable.

You guys are well-positioned in a lot of ways.

But I guess talk about how you view your competitive position as a variety of other networks come online and new stablecoins come online.

Yeah, absolutely.

I mean, I think the first, just start with the core, which is our stablecoin network has really strong network effects.

We have liquidity network effects globally.

We have infrastructure network effects just in terms of where we're plugged in around the world.

There's tens of thousands of products and services that integrate to our network, which really drives the developer flywheels.

And so we're in a very strong position there.

And we're taking that and we're expanding kind of down the stack and up the stack.

And I think in our view, if you think about where we are in the evolution of this,

the global economic system is enormous.

And we expect more and more of the economic system to, as I said, become machine intermediated on these new kind of economic operating systems.

And we're still at the front edge of that.

We have a market that really grew out of speculation on cryptocurrencies.

And now we're seeing more and more of actual financial contracts, actual trade flows, payments flows, treasury activities, investment products, lending products.

All of this is actual.

We're starting to come over.

But we're at the front edge of that.

And so I think our view is that there are going to be some very significant scaled internet platform companies built out of this transformation over the next 5, 10, 15 years.

We think that these can be as big or bigger than prior internet platform companies that were built around centers of gravity around search or social or mobile or cloud or e-commerce.

We think that that's going to take place.

And we think that we're in a very good position to provide really great information.

We think that we're in a very good position to provide really great infrastructure across those different layers.

And I think if you look at what we've been able to do with ARK, even just getting to testnet, the range of major firms from around the world that touch literally over $100 trillion of assets, whether those are custodians, exchanges, clearinghouses, payment systems, etc.

We're putting forward a model that we think can work for scaled mainstream adoption.

And so that's an infrastructure problem.

And we're doing it in a way where we can build a distribution.

We're building a distributed network of distributed stakeholder participation, distributed governance, and kind of bring that into the world.

And obviously, that's what we're considering as we evaluate the design of an ARK token as well.

And then on the other hand, we definitely see an application layer emerging on top of these platforms.

And I think, likewise, we're still in the early stages of the application layers being built.

We are definitely taking a crack at part of that by building a payment utility.

This CPN as a payment application.

But we're designing it in a way where other financial institutions can use it, benefit from it, and generate revenue from it.

We're not trying to compete with them as well.

And so at every layer of what we do, we try and build kind of market neutrality and interoperability at the core.

And that has served us well.

I mean, one of the things we've pointed out this morning in the earnings call is we actually run, as of October,

the largest cross-charting.

We have the largest cross-chain interoperability protocol in the world.

CCTP, which is Circles Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, in October was greater than 50% of all cross-chain traffic accounting for all assets across all blockchains.

And that's really significant.

We really want to be part of the solution to interoperability while we build at these different layers of the stack.

We've had a number of conversations about the local regulatory environment, how that's changing recently.

But what's going on internationally?

Last time you were on the show, we talked about how part of Circles Edge is having offices in a bunch of different countries

and being set up to navigate what will ultimately be unique regulatory environments in a bunch of different countries.

Well, it's been amazing, actually.

Since the Genius Act, we've seen almost every major government in the world accelerating plans around building local rules around stablecoins.

We've seen, for example, Hong Kong.

In August, when effective with their new rules, we're seeing regimes working on this from major emerging markets to some of the largest developed markets like Korea,

which is accelerating their efforts around stablecoin rules, UK accelerating their efforts.

So now everyone's sort of getting behind this model of private sector, bank and non-bank issued stablecoins, clear supervision, usually supervision by the central banks,

just like we're going to be overseen by the national.

Bank regulator here in the United States.

And so that kind of standard is cascading around the world.

And I think also a lot of these regulators are looking at ways to support kind of reciprocity or kind of consistency as well.

And so I think that's really important as we build infrastructure that we know that it'll work in all these different places around the world.

So I would say that the activity for us internationally has really, really accelerated.

And you'll see a lot more as well.

As we go forward.

But I think, you know, the U.S. is actually really providing leadership right now on on this in this whole area.

And the rest of the world is taking notice and following.

It's kind of a national competitiveness issue as well.

Fantastic.

Well, congratulations on a successful earning season.

We'd love to have you back on the show soon.

Thanks, guys.

Have a great rest of the day.

We'll talk to you.

Cheers.

Bye-bye.

Go bye.

Before we bring in our next guest from the Rooster Room waiting room, let me tell you about Finn.ai, the number one AI agent.

So for customer service, number one in performance benchmarks, number one in competitive bake-offs, number one ranking on G2.

Our next guest is Vlad.

He's building Lighter.

We have some big news on the funding side.

How are you doing, Vlad?

Good to meet you.

Hey, guys.

Welcome to the show.

Welcome to the show.

What's happening?

Hey, guys.

Can you hear me?

Yes, we can hear you.

Please introduce yourself.

Introduce the company for those who aren't familiar.

Awesome.

Yeah, good to be here.

Actually, I think you had my former co-host.

I had my co-founder, Scott, on a couple of weeks ago, who's now working on Cognition.

Oh, Scott.

Of course.

We've had him on a bunch of times.

TBPN Hall of Fame.

TBPN is made possible by Cognition, the makers of Devon, the AI software engineer.

We love doing ad reads for Cognition.

Although they're makers of Devon.

Oh, nice, nice, nice.

Today, we're here to talk about you and Lighter.

Yes.

Exactly.

So I'm Vlad.

I'm founder and CEO of Lighter.

Which is a decentralized exchange built on top of Ethereum.

We can talk more about how we built it and why.

But we launched in January and kind of had pretty strong growth this year with our main net.

And we actually had a public launch in October 1.

But yeah, and I guess before Lighter, I worked on Lunch Club with Scott.

Prior to that, I guess I'm kind of like, like, I'm not a crypto guy that got into finance.

I'm more like a finance guy who took a detour to AI and then, you know, got into DeFi.

Yeah.

Talk about some of the choices that you've made.

Like, why Ethereum compared to other chains?

Why decentralized exchange?

Like, of the technical decisions that you made, I feel like we've talked to a lot of folks who have...

Picked out different quadrants, if we do a two by two quadrant or something like that.

Yeah.

You've clearly landed in one particular piece, one particular spot on the market map.

How would you describe the trade-offs that you've made?

And then why did you make those trade-offs?

Awesome.

Yeah, that's a great question.

And we actually started working on Lighter right around three years ago.

So like mid to late 22 is when we were thinking through that idea maze, as it were.

So it's interesting to like look back now.

And the genesis of the idea, right, was that we were thinking about digital assets, right?

Like digital assets have been around for 10, 15 years, right?

Like they've been traded a lot.

I mean, but most of them represent some kind of blockchain or decentralized protocol or like rails for the future of finance.

But the weird thing was that like 99% of the assets were digital assets.

Like 99% of the activity of how they're traded actually did not use the rails of the stuff that these assets are building, right?

Like it's actually trading in a centralized way and like centralized exchanges have, you know, there's some good ones, right?

You know, they, you know, I think some of them definitely have provided value to customers.

But like at the basic premise, right, like a centralized exchange doesn't actually use the blockchain at its core to verify what's going on.

And like in some cases, it's actually worth it.

It's actually worse than TradFi, right?

Like at least in TradFi, you have, you know, regulations and the legal system to fall back on if something goes wrong, like, right?

And we said the thing is that like actually almost three years to the day is when FTX collapsed.

And we were looking at that when we were thinking about how to build lighter and we thought, okay, well, now people will get it and like volume will move away from centralized exchanges after like one of the big ones failed.

And that didn't happen.

So what that taught us was that.

Actually, like the decentralized exchanges that existed at the time, like their product market fit was so bad that people would rather trade somewhere where there's like a one in six chance of the whole thing being a fraud than like using the decentralized products.

And so, right, so then we thought, okay, well, we, this is something we should be part of the solution to, right?

And so for us, it's like, okay, what we want to achieve is low cost, low latency, secure, verifiable and composable.

And like the first three of those are pretty self-explanatory, but you know, what does verifiable mean?

Right.

It means that everything that happens, there's a cryptographic proof that it happened fairly incorrectly.

And like, why is that important?

Well, if you ask the reverse question, like what if, what if it's not verifiable?

Well, that means there's some part of the system where you're just like, trust me, bro, which is kind of, again, defeats the, even if there's one part like that, you know, like the whole thing could be, you know, manipulated.

You know, corrupted.

Right.

So that's a problem.

Right.

And then composable is also important because at the end of the day, we're not just trying to build a sandbox for people to speculate on.

We want to build something that's composable with the rest of DeFi, whether it's lending stable coins, you know, staking, you know, prediction markets, all this other stuff.

So that can kind of all work together in smart contracts.

So anyway, so we had those five goals and going back to your question, like, so theory was the obvious choice for the security layer, right?

For it to be secure.

We.

Had a pretty strong view that the layer one that's by far the most secure out of things you can build on is Ethereum.

Another, you know, we, you know, Solana has built a great L1 as well and others have too.

But, you know, Ethereum is like very secure.

It's been stable for a very long time.

So that was pretty clear to us.

And yeah, we can dive into how we achieve the other goals.

But as far as like why decentralized and why Ethereum, I think that that gets into those points.

I don't know if we have enough time to go super deep into more of the technical side.

I'm more interested to hear about how you met Ken Griffin, honestly.

So could you tell me the story of of of the Ken Griffin recruitment?

I would love to know, like, how did he even know to reach out to you?

What what happened there?

Tell me the full story, because I think that's fascinating.

Yeah. Yeah. So and by the way, I'm, you know, also based in Miami now for the last five years.

So, you know, not only did I learn a lot of stuff from Ken about finance and business, but also that South Florida is a good area.

The location. Yeah.

Yeah. But, you know, so so I guess, you know, the thing with my time at Citadel and, you know, so I was 18 when I finished Harvard and actually even while a student.

Let's give it up for finishing Harvard at 18.

Congratulations. Continue.

What's that?

What's that account like VCs congratulating themselves or we're congratulating you?

You just said a fact.

You just said a fact.

But yeah, so and actually like even at school, I did some trading and was working on kind of a side project with two friends around options.

And so, you know, so I was doing that and that didn't quite get off the ground.

But I got to know the team at Citadel through, you know, essentially like the research firm.

So, you know, it's not.

Oh, wow.

You know, it's not like Ken personally gave me a call or something, but I got to know the team and they wanted me to join.

And then kind of towards the end of the process, Ken got involved and spent a bunch of time with me, you know, to tell me more about what their high level goals are at Citadel and their strategy and why it would be a good fit for me and kind of making sure that I'm comfortable joining them.

And I guess without going into too much details, I mean, he made it very attractive proposition.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And was pretty involved, you know, the first couple of weeks, especially of my work there.

And yeah, you know, he's to this day someone I certainly look up to.

And yeah, he's going to.

Sorry.

There's this fascinating lineage here.

Obviously, Ken Griffin went to Harvard, was trading in his dorm room.

It took him a couple extra.

He didn't.

He didn't graduate at 18.

So you sort of mogged him on that front.

But.

But then, of course, he had a deep relationship with Robinhood and Robinhood markets came in and invested in this round.

And so there's a whole bunch of like full circle moments.

I did want to quickly ask if you think that the industry fully learned its lesson from FTX, because I feel like there's I've seen some chatter over the last few weeks around various exchanges saying like, no, your your funds are frozen.

But don't don't worry. We're we're we're working on it.

And it's, you know, maybe sending some alarm bells.

Right. So October 10th was an interesting moment for the space.

I think that actually DeFi kind of as a whole worked well.

Right. Whether it's Aave or Morpho or all those all those protocols.

And I think our competitors handled those market moves in different ways.

But I think all of them in the context of DeFi work the way they were.

Right. And so I think that's a really good point that you're making about how it's supposed to work, you know, some of the centralized exchanges, I think maybe again, like the problem there, right, it's like lack of transparency where you don't really know, like, did they actually liquidate their customers correctly or not?

Like maybe they did. Right. Like maybe maybe everything worked exactly as expected, but if it didn't, there would be no way we would even know that.

And so I don't I'm not aware of any cases of specific wrongdoing by centralized exchanges.

That cycle. But again, with the lack of transparency, there was no way I would know that.

And, you know, we do know there have been some like blow ups of the kind of smaller hedge funds, like on chain hedge funds.

Right. And what ultimately caused those is unclear.

But the one thing I will say is I remember after FTX, there was this whole thing about like, OK, let's even centralized exchanges.

That's like, let's make them more verifiable and like prove reserves.

Now, of course, like, what does that mean?

Because like you can prove.

Assets, but how do you prove liabilities?

But still, like, there's some push to do that.

And I remember Vitalik had some ideas on how to do that and Binance was looking into it.

And then, like, I think someone asked CZ about it and he was just like, well, you know, Vitalik is very technical.

Some of this stuff is like too complex or something like that.

Right. So I don't know if the centralized exchanges have really, truly learned their lessons on that front.

But, you know, did anything particularly egregious happen that I know of?

I think the point is that, you know, I mean, you're not, you know, if you can have like a few people who are like, OK, I'm going to walk into a startup and I'm going to look at the stock of these investments.

And I think they're going to, you know, look at the market.

They're going to put in, you know, what a couple of dollars they're going to put in and we're going to see what happens.

I just kind of really like what I'm seeing.

Like, I think, in this, I mean, you know, in this area of people's investing, you know, we're not going to go into an app and look at it and say, OK, well, hey, we've got a $45.

Let's buy this and say, hey, let's buy that.

We're going to look at this price.

You know, you've got to be big on price savings.

Have a great rest of your day.

Thank you.

See you.

Let me tell you about Adio,

customer relationship magic.

Adio is the AI-native CRM that builds, scales,

and grows your company to the next level.

You can get started for free.

Also, I'm going to tell you about 8sleep.com.

Jordy's traveling, but I got a 91.

Whoa.

Seven hours, 55 minutes.

I'll give it to you.

Let's go.

And our next guest is Andrew D'Souza from Bordy.

He's in the restroom waiting room.

Welcome.

Now he's in the TVP and Ultraman.

What's happening?

Great, great to meet, and welcome to the show.

Kick it off maybe with a quick intro on yourself,

background, and then let's talk about Bordy.

Yeah, yeah.

So I'm the founder, CEO, creator of Bordy,

the AI super connector.

Bordy is helping founders meet investors primarily,

but connecting people for business and economic reasons.

We launched a program about two weeks ago

to try and get 100 founders to help close the round.

We have 5,000 founders.

We're raising $16 billion to sign up,

and 600 investors running about a trillion dollars of capital.

Some size.

So yeah, I think we've probably got about 10%

of the active fundraising happening right now

among founders that are working through Bordy,

which is pretty exciting.

Awesome.

So yeah, I guess immediate thought is with products like this,

one of the challenges,

is just balancing the network, basically.

And within venture, it's oftentimes the companies

that have the most demand for their equity

or the companies that are maybe performing the best

oftentimes don't need intros.

They're in the position of saying no.

How are you thinking about maintaining quality on the platform

when you're a business and you want to be as big

as you can possibly be?

And I imagine you have a strategy there.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I think that was something that I was worried about.

This is the reason why we didn't start with the idea

of connecting founders and investors.

It just sort of happened organically.

This was the activity that was taking place.

I've been shocked at the caliber of founders

that have come in looking for help.

And I think as a CEO, as a founder,

your job is to create demand for your shares.

It doesn't matter whether you're Elon or Roy Lee

or a YC founder.

That's your job.

And you'll take all the help you can get.

Most founders only raise capital two or three times,

in their life.

And having someone that can help you navigate that,

get the right introductions.

I think there are probably 50 or 100 founders in the world.

I think this is the reason why we talk about

this sort of AI bubble right now.

There's maybe 50 or 100 founders in the world

that every investor is chasing, right?

Because that's the hype cycle.

There's probably thousands of founders

who have incredible businesses.

We're talking to them.

They have incredible businesses, incredible metrics.

And they're just, you know,

they just haven't, they're not based in Silicon Valley

or they're not, you know,

straight down the middle pattern recognition.

They're not based at all.

I'm back.

They may not be based at all.

Stupid joke.

Good luck raising if you're not based these days.

Yeah, that makes total sense.

What, like, where does this go from here?

This feels like a good early wedge,

but, you know, hard to build a billion dollar,

business yourself just within, just within venture.

So I imagine you have a number of other kind of pathways

or use cases for the, for the kind of introduction engine

or I don't know how you.

Yeah, yeah.

We've built Boardio as like an AI board member.

So what is the most important meeting for the CEO

to take at any time, right?

Is it a customer meeting?

Are they hiring an executive?

Are they trying to get on, you know, a podcast?

Are they, you know, like, is it a big partnership?

Is it Corp dev?

It happens to be that fundraising ends up

being a high urgency place where you can build

a great relationship.

But I think of Boardio as an economy.

You know, Boardio, every time you connect two people,

there's some economic opportunity that is unlocked.

There's some latent economic potential.

And we can financialize it.

Yeah, I love it.

It's actually, it's actually what you're doing.

It's true.

It's actually good.

Okay, can I give, can I give feedback to Board,

if I get an intro and I, and I, and I take the call

and I'm like, can I be like, yo, Boardie, that, never again,

never again, because we've, I mean,

everyone's gotten an intro from somebody and,

and you're like, wait, why'd you make that intro?

Like I jumped on, they didn't know who I was.

Why am I on with the venture fund that loves firing CEOs?

Don't introduce me to them.

Introduce me to the friendly ones.

Yeah, so how do you, how do you,

cause, cause I can imagine that's like one way

that you, you want to make sure,

you want to get to the point where the entire industry is,

is onboarding, like every single founder, every, every, every,

every single investor, but as an investor,

for an investor to like not churn,

they need to be able to like give feedback and say like,

hey, like this didn't meet,

this didn't meet my bar for a meeting.

I don't, you know, if you, you know,

and if you keep sending people meetings or intros

that don't meet their bar, eventually they'll just say like,

I'm going to, you know, log off.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

So, so this is, this is one of the things we take a lot of,

we take feedback, Boardie has goodwill with people, right?

So his idea, the same way that if anytime

I make an introduction,

I'm gambling goodwill, I'm going to,

if I make a bad introduction, I burn some goodwill.

If I make a great introduction,

maybe I've gained some goodwill

and you're sort of doing that calculation at any given time.

The version of Boardie, if you just sign up,

you're talking to a low latency,

relatively low cost on the phone, on WhatsApp,

you're just talking to, you know,

the standard version of Boardie, what we tried to do,

we had this experiment,

we were running this fundraising thing.

We said, what if you could remove the constraints

of latency and cost?

What if I could spend a hundred times the tokens?

What if I could let Boardie run for 30 minutes,

trying to find the perfect introduction

and position you in the perfect way?

Could I get better results?

And that's kind of what we're seeing.

So now we've had 5,000,

and Boardie's talked to 5,000 founders

that are raising in 600 investors in the last two weeks.

He has now picked the top hundred that he knows he can help

that are going to be in demand

from the investors in his network.

And we put them into a shared Slack channel with us

and Boardie and the founder.

And we've now got those shared Slack channels

with people who are like, hey, here's some investors.

What do you think?

Get feedback from the founders.

We're doing the same thing with investors.

So then the investors are sort of signing up and saying,

here's a few founders that are raising.

We think they'd fit your thesis.

And Boardie's just learning.

So you're like, actually, that's not a good fit.

Or I've talked to this founder.

More like this, less like this.

And over the course of a couple of weeks,

we really dial it in on both sides.

And we just make sure that you're spending time.

And it's less about capital allocations,

more about how are you allocating your time and attention

onto the deals that are actually likely to materialize.

As an investor, the deals are going to win.

As a founder, the founders, the investors

that are actually going to give you a term sheeting fund.

That makes sense.

What are some other types of work

that you expect Boardie to do in the future?

Yeah, we're already starting to see a lot in corporate enterprise

sales and biz dev and partnerships.

It starts with the corporate venture capital arms.

So we're getting a ton of corporate venture capital funds

coming in.

And now we're talking to their innovation teams.

And it's the same thing.

It's like, hey, look, I've got to stay abreast of what's

happening in my industry.

And it's almost impossible.

Maybe I'll watch TPPN and see who comes on there.

But that's almost too late.

Right?

Right?

It's actually like, I've got to see who's starting a company,

who's just being funded, who do I want to be tracking.

And so Boardie's starting to help with that

and making those introductions.

Hiring is another one that I think is interesting,

especially when people are passive.

They're not actively looking.

They don't want to take a bunch of recruiter calls.

But they'll talk to Boardie like, I might start a company.

But if there's a really great startup out there,

I might join the team.

And so those kind of conversations

are quite interesting as well.

But it's like, whatever you would

call your board member, whatever introduction

is going to move the needle for you

that is worth the time of the CEO,

that's what we want to work on.

That makes a lot of sense.

I'm looking for a board member who

can take me on a track day.

That's my only thing I want to get out of them.

Take me to the track.

Put me in a race car.

It better not have a passenger seat.

And then get out of the way, because I'm

building on my own.

Thank you so much.

Yeah.

Yeah, I mean, that's a good challenge.

Maybe that's customer development.

Maybe once you get into the really high tier of Boardie

spend, you do a track day.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, you know, so Nico Rosberg is a big Boardie user.

No way.

There we go.

Oh, he's been on the show.

Big time Boardie user.

That's awesome.

And so he could probably make it happen for you.

Very cool.

I love it.

I like it.

I like it.

Thank you so much for coming on.

It's one of those things that in kind of working on,

when you describe it of just like a place

that a founder can go to just get help with their business,

it's surprisingly not something that nobody's made

that pitch on the show to date, which is surprising,

because that's pretty much feels like very valuable

to a lot of the companies that are coming on.

Yeah.

Fantastic.

Well, thank you so much for taking the time

to come talk to us.

Congratulations on all the progress.

Thanks a lot, guys.

Great to meet you.

We'll try out the product.

And you need to find a guest.

And the exact values we're raising.

Yeah, that'd be great.

There you go.

I'd love to give it a shot.

Awesome.

Have a good one.

We'll talk to you soon.

Cheers, Andrew.

Goodbye.

Let me tell you about public.com, investing for those

who take it seriously.

They've got multi-ass investing, industry-leading yields.

They're trusted by millions.

I'm also going to tell you about Adquik,

out-of-home advertising made easy and measurable.

Say goodbye to the headaches of out-of-home advertising.

Only Adquik combines technology, out-of-home expertise,

and data to enable efficient, seamless ad buying

across the globe.

Our next guest is Parag Agarwal from Parallel AI.

Welcome to the show, Parag.

How you doing?

Hey, hey.

Hey, hey.

Good to see you, Max.

What's happening?

There's so much fanfare in doing all this.

Are you at a newcomer event right now?

I am.

Oh, yeah.

You've got the step-in review behind you.

Cerebral of the Probe AI Summit.

Congratulations.

What did you announce on stage?

What are you announcing here on TVPN?

I announced on stage that we just raised CTV.

We raised $100 million from some of the best investors.

Yeah.

Let's give it up for the best investors.

$740 million.

Index Ventures.

There we go.

Got some Spark Capital participation.

We love to see it.

Coastal is in there.

First round.

Terrain.

Wow.

Really?

Really?

Murders.

Wow.

Mahmoud Ekliner is joining the board.

That's exciting.

That's exciting.

What?

Kind of looking like the Figma board.

We've got a good crew here.

I like this.

So take me through the actual company progress,

the progress that unlocked this $100 million Series A.

Obviously, there was some demand.

There was some research progress.

What was the shape of the data points that went in?

How did you get to the ultimate deck that got this across the finish line?

So we got our first round two years ago.

We started with this sort of find the sky idea that agents are going to use the web

and they're going to use them a lot and we need to build new infrastructure for them.

There weren't any agents around in that moment.

None of them were using the web when we started.

They were trying.

Some of them were trying.

Yes.

And this year, everything changed.

Everyone's now building an agency.

Yeah.

Every agent.

And every agent wants to connect to those.

So the market just came alive, I want to say six, nine months ago.

The most frontier customers started doing this last year and became our design partners.

This year, the number of customers, the number of queries, the diversity of work,

like there's coding agents using us.

There's people in sales, building agents using us.

Finance, risk, compliance, insurance.

Healthcare.

People doing scientific research agents.

Yeah.

People in pharma and biotech figuring out how to use web search APIs to build agents.

So like it's a completely different world this year as it relates to agents using the

web.

So, yeah, to make it super simple, people are using parallel web systems within, you

know, maybe a SaaS provider is integrating parallel into their products so that if somebody's

doing research, let's say in a CRM on a company, they're going to be able to integrate parallel

into their product.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's, that's, that's a good product query.

You see the white off prem?

Our products are APIs.

Our users are agents.

Our customers are people building agents.

Right?

So if someone builds an agent to say, okay, I'm going to take your CRM and add very interesting

data to it so that you can take better actions, that agent, the database will go to that bugs

and implement it.

We'll call our APIs in order to search the web, in order to pull content from the web,

in order to get the highest quality information to be able to set up that database.

React to this post from Jim Cramer.

He says, when I use ChatGPT or the others, I can tell quickly that they won't pay up

for good sources.

We all know this.

So what's the point?

They need to start paying newspapers and stop using bogus sources we would never use ourselves.

We need integrity, not volume.

There's a bunch of ways you could read that.

But my take was there is a data quality opportunity, especially in the enterprise, especially where

willingness to pay is maybe really high.

And so how are you thinking about making sure that Parallel and the Deep Research API has

the highest quality data forever?

Yeah.

So, you know, perhaps I've been partly with Jim Cramer.

I don't always.

Two things there.

How do you get the highest quality Deep Research?

That is a lot of things.

High-quality data, authoritative data is a part of it.

And then there's a lot of other technology we're building on top, whether it be at the

ranking layer, the retrieval layer, the crawling layer, the reasoning layer, to get you higher

quality Deep Research.

I asked you to try our Deep Research project.

research product and compare it to open eyes and we win nine times out of ten so i want everyone to

try that and tell us if i'm wrong go to the data question um i think there are deals being done by

people uh the world i don't want to live in is only google and openai's agents have access to

some data and most publishers don't get to make those deals and most other agents don't get to

have that access uh that is the core mission of our business we started with building products

for ai customers we've recently started uh figuring out what the incentives are for publishers who

allow ai agents to use them uh which will include payments which will include other forms of value

which is transactions uh and which include distribution right which is which are the things

that people care about

on the web uh i've sort of having run twitter before i understand the concerns of someone

publishing on the web and uh business models around ads are likely to evolve and that's part

of the reason we end up doing this company because we think we have an opinion or two to bring to

life here do large revenue multiples scare you no good no as long as you know what you're doing

confidence i love it love the confidence got to be confident congratulations but yeah i i love how

the the even even since the last uh your last appearance you know the vision uh and opportunity

uh just seems bigger and bigger totally yeah makes a ton of sense yeah it's great to have you back

uh at this rate i'm sure uh come back before the end of the year weeks

i'm gonna ship a product in a couple of weeks and be like fantastic hit us up then congratulations

to you soon frog thanks for having me uh let me tell you about bezel get bezel.com your bezel

concierge is available now to source you any watch on the planet seriously any watch i want to do a

lightning round we got a bunch of posts we're going to try and go through them as fast as

possible uh first brian johnson does did confirm this is from brandon corral uh brian johnson

confirms he was not one-shotted by a recent magic mushroom trip you said if brian johnson comes out

of this five gram he said oh yeah he says yeah we're gonna conquer death we're still on then he's

certainly a true believer what did he say he replied to tbpn's post he said we're gonna

conquer death so brian johnson is feeling good looking good back on the timeline uh not one shot

i suppose one of the founders of uh chad ide says uh he quoted my post and said really great post

however it doesn't apply to chad ide we're five steps ahead different plane of thinking

but really great posts are reposting for visibility

nice little bro

i i i want to say i think that's a pretty hilarious i i did i did sneak a peek at your post

uh during uh during the show and uh i don't think you got called unc as bad as as i i expected you

you made it sound like you were getting destroyed you did very well you got over a thousand likes

and uh people are like oh you're taking shots of gary tan no gary tan chimed in he said good

points big thanks a lot of people a lot of people did identify uh

that you were rage baiting the rage baiters which is funny i had to use their own tricks

against it yeah you did i think in this case you used the tricks for good uh and i and i think

it's a great post and uh and i enjoy uh but you know it maybe we have to have the you know there's

always there's always room for follow-up maybe we'll talk to gary tan later this week we'll get

him on the show think about how he's thinking about the future of yc maybe we'll have the

founder of chad labs chad ide whatever yeah so we we do at labs we will also be demoing the product at

At some point, I believe we'll be getting a preview

of what the actual product is.

If there's something awesome behind the scenes,

we're gonna tell you what that is.

Let's also just-

I just love responding and being like,

yep, actually it doesn't apply to us.

We're five steps ahead.

We're five steps ahead.

I mean, that is just a complete trump card.

How do you respond to that?

How do you- Levels.

Levels, I think he wins.

Much like Wander, find your happy place.

Book of Wander with inspiring views.

Hotel Graded Men, these dreamy beds,

top tier cleaning and 24-7 concierge service.

It's a vacation home, but better.

What is this?

La Lamp.

Introducing a La Lamp, says Shavir Sharkari,

an emotional and expressive robot

to reshape our attachment to technology.

Is this a CGI vibe reel or is this a real product?

Do you have any idea?

Who put this in the show notes?

I put it in the show notes.

Okay, do you think this is real?

I'm trying to find where you are.

It looks real.

Yeah, it looks real.

It looks real, okay.

It looks pretty cool.

I wonder, wait, wait.

So would you buy this?

What is the value of this?

It's obviously very cute, very cool.

It's the Pixar Lamp, but it should exist,

but why, what does it do?

It's pretty cool, I don't know.

It's weird.

It just feels cool.

It seems like a cool thing to have.

There was a-

Put a speaker on it.

I'm like 90% sure it's real.

There was a Apple research paper that came out like,

I don't know, six months ago.

It was all about like expressive robots.

Sure.

And they had a bunch of like demos and stuff

and how they could build this stuff.

Yeah.

It looks very exciting.

Yeah, well the website is La Lamp.

L-E-L-A-M-P dot com.

That's a good one.

L-E-L-A-M-P dot com.

You can pre-order it.

The lamp like follows around your cursor.

Pretty cool website.

Let's see what the checkout is.

It's only 50 bucks?

Wow.

Okay.

This is very cool.

I have been delight baited.

I have not been rage baited by this.

I think this is a great, great launch.

And in other news, Jim Cramer is posting about

quantum computing.

He says, Rigetti, what an opportunity, ka-ching.

Buy IBM.

What does that even mean?

Cramer posts like a crazy amount.

I mean, he's got 2.3 million followers.

He's posting like every half hour.

Like, the guy's a machine.

He's going to be on the show in a couple of weeks.

We're very excited about it.

I cannot wait.

It's going to be a lot of fun.

Anyway, that's our show for today.

I do not tolerate Cramer slander.

Yeah, no, no.

I think he's entertaining.

He's insightful.

He's controversial.

He's a total package.

We love Cramer here.

He's great.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

There is a review from Andrej Karpathy.

I missed this one.

Oh, there's a couple of posts that I missed, actually.

Andrej Karpathy says, I took delivery

of a beautiful, shiny, new HW4 Tesla Model X today.

I like this.

Hardware 4.

He cares about the chip inside that thing.

He doesn't care about what the light bar on the front is

or the door handles or whether the doors go up.

Andrej Karpathy cares about the GPU inside.

So I immediately took it out for an FSD test.

Drive a bit like I used to do almost daily for five years.

Basically, I'm amazed.

It drives really, really well.

Really smooth, confident, noticeably better

than what I'm used to on HW3, my previous car, and eons

ahead of the version I remember driving up Highway 280

on my first day at Tesla nine years ago,

where I had to intervene every time the road mildly

curved or sloped.

Note, this is V13.

My car hasn't been offered the latest V14 yet.

On the highway, I felt like a passenger in some super high

tech maglev train pod.

The car is locked in the center of the lane

while I'm looking out from the Model X's higher vantage point

and its panoramic front window, listening

to the incredible sound system or chatting

with Grok on city streets.

The car casually handled a number of tricky scenarios

that I remember losing sleep over just a few years ago.

It negotiated incoming cars in tight lanes.

It gracefully went around construction and temporary

in-lane stationary cars.

It correctly timed tricky left-hander

turns with incoming traffic from both sides.

It's a glowing review, glowing review,

of Tesla self-driving from the man who basically invented it

and started the whole process.

I mean, I don't know if he started it, but he was incremental.

He was instrumental in the development of it.

So let me go out there.

We also missed it, but OpenAI released GPT 5.1,

rolling out to all users this week.

Yeah.

Neer says, Neer says, chat, you've

effectiveness at GPT is officially in its Fiji phase

now, if you're wondering why the upgrade doesn't come

with benchmarks.

Have fun.

Yeah, no benchmarks.

So yes, there's two models.

There's 5.1 thinking and instant.

So if you go to the actual model router on chattgpt.com

or whatever, there's GPT-5, which you can do pro,

which is like the super-long, almost like a deep, deep

research product.

Then the rest of them are just the 5.1 thinking.

But yeah, no.

No.

Benchmarks or like any kind of really technical report. I in the blog post. It was a lot about the like personality of the model

She also released a separate blog post like on her

sub stack and she there was some mention of like

They're definitely like they tried to address kind of the 4-0

Like one shotting stuff. They're like, okay. We're definitely aware that there are some problems with

Like a very small amount of people becoming very, you know addicted to the models

But yeah, nothing like very technical out of this they're like it was only 1% of our user base

10 million people want to kill room

Up your security

Anyways, we actually have to go over to

Base, yeah, it's a conference

Hosted by my dear friend will Cofield, you know, we got a head over there

We're gonna have a little chat. That'd be fun more podcasting

Another two hours of offline podcasting

Cannot wait cannot wait to be back tomorrow. Have a thank you for hanging out

Leave us five stars an apple podcast and Spotify subscribe your email at TV p.m. Com and we'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye
