I hate calling things bubbles, but I
think we're in a period of extreme
euphoria where you read and speak to
investors and they say that the numbers
don't matter and the financial
statements no longer matter because this
is changing the world. I say, well, I've
seen this before. You know, I saw that
Nortell was changing the world and
Lucent and Cisco and 360 networks. They
were building out the infrastructure of
the internet that we're using today.
But those companies don't exist anymore.
>> Anthony Schilapati is a forensic
accountant who saw what others missed,
predicting the collapse of both Valiant
Pharmaceuticals and Nortell long before
it happened. He spent decades reading
what companies don't want you to see,
the footnotes. Now he's spotting
familiar warning signs in today's AI
boom.
>> What are the red flags you look for?
It's not red flags. We call them
flammable items. So, it's a three-stage
process. The first stage is
>> This episode of the knowledge project is
forformational purposes only. The views
and opinions expressed by Shane Parish
or our guests are solely their own.
Nothing in this conversation should be
considered investment advice, financial
guidance, or recommendation to buy or
sell any security. Always do your own
due diligence, or consult with a
qualified financial adviser before
making investment decisions. It's time
to listen and learn.
>> I want to start with how you got into
forensic accounting.
>> I was an accountant and I was working at
Arthur Anderson doing the normal audit
sort of preparatory work and I uh found
it unfulfilling uh because the work I
would do I would find interesting or
concerns with the accounting or
otherwise and the clients it didn't end
up ending anywhere. So, uh, what ended
up happening was the there was some due
diligence work to do where we could do
actually look at transactions, companies
calling us to say, you know, we want to
spin out this business or we want to
make this acquisition. And then I asked,
put my hand up, said, listen, can I do
that sort of work? And then I started
doing it and I loved it. I saw some huge
fulfillment. And then it's all about
people you meet. I met a a gentleman
named Al Rosen and he was head of
accounting at York University and he was
a forensic accountant. He had his own
practice. He taught taught us to pass
the the the Yuthi at the the exam or the
CPA exam at the time and um I said you
know I'd like to work with you and he
said well you get your CA work done and
then we'll think about it. And uh that's
what I did. And so then I toutelaged
under him for some four years. And uh
that that really uh made it happen.
>> You weren't on the Enron file, were you?
>> I was not on the Enron file. I left
Arthur Anderson in 1997. Couldn't even
spell Enron at the time. And uh it's
it's a very sad thing what happened.
>> What did happen at Enron?
>> They essentially had a number of
offbalance sheet exposures. So they
would enter into derivative type
contracts where that were tied to an
energy price for example or even the
company's own stock price and it'd be
like this debt only comes due if the
stock price falls to X. This debt only
comes due or this derivative transaction
we'd entered into and Ron was an energy
trader. um you know so if the price of
electricity in kilowatt hours rises to a
certain amount well then there this debt
is no longer due. If it falls to this
level then they're they have to pay uh
some counterparty and so those were
those those risks were essentially
offbalance sheet. So those were not
sitting on the company's liabilities.
They were all contingent and at the time
the accounting rules were such that the
this these numbers were not included on
the liabilities. They were just in the
notes. And so all of a sudden so people
weren't paying attention because nobody
read that reads the notes. And so then
all of a sudden things started to
happen. There was a change and movement
in commodity prices. Okay, this is now
we're dealing with the dot. There was a
lot of a lot of changes that happened in
the economy. We we had a we had a a uh a
recession in the early 2000s, right? And
so that led to a lot of movements in
commodity prices that triggered the
derivatives. Surprise, surprise, they
can't make the payments. It's done.
>> And they weren't required to reserve or
put away in reserves any amount of
>> well, if it wasn't on the balance sheet,
then investors and wouldn't wouldn't
have noticed that that there was not
enough assets per perhaps to cover. and
and why the implication to Arthur
Anderson which I think is important and
then it's near and dear to my heart is
you know the auditors at Arthur Anderson
they're working on the file they ended
up signing off on all these things well
when essentially the proverbial hit the
fan all of a sudden they were asking
questions and the regulator asked for
the working papers of the auditor that
the papers of which they would support
the audit work and they knew perhaps
that they didn't do enough work so they
shredded the documents. So all of a
sudden they became guilty because of
their actions
>> and so it was found in the courts um
upon appeal that uh Arthur Anderson was
not guilty but that was way after the
fact because Arthur Anderson was already
was brought to its knees and it was
over. became a scapegoat for everything
wrong with uh with with accounting at
the time and uh look change needed to
happen. Arthur Anderson was around the
world all the partners were folded into
the other firms.
>> What are the limitations on audits?
>> The limitations?
>> Yeah. Hey, the limitations are you're
hired to be a independent to give your
independent opinion and attest that the
financial statements present fairly in
all material respects in accordance with
some set of accounting standards and/or
standards that's associated with a
contract for example. And the challenge
is time because you have to do this
quickly, pressures on costs and
essentially think about it this way.
It's like I tell you, look, I I just
prepared my report card. I got an A. I
now hand it to you and say, look, it's
an A. And if you say that it's an A,
I'll pay you X amount of money. So, look
at your situation. You come back and
say, well, it's actually not an A. It's
kind of a B+.
Uh, how much am I paying you again?
>> Yeah.
>> What do you mean it's a B+? Do you think
that question that the way I answered
that question couldn't have been this
way or the other way you know and this
is it ties into so many things you know
AI and so forth business is judgment
people run companies they don't run
themselves the decisions associated with
a business transaction end up being
reflected on those financial statements
but when the group that's making the
decision in the business to do something
well then they come back to the office
and show up in the in the accounting
department and say, "Hey, we just did
this. You know, can you guys figure out
how to account for it?" And all of a
sudden, the accountants are like, "God,
what do I do now? How do I do this?"
Because then they and by the way, when
you do this, I want it presented as as,
you know, as bright as possible so that
our investors and all our stakeholders
are really excited by the results like
don't present it badly.
>> You you said a lot of people don't read
the footnotes or the financial
statements. Is that changing in a world
of AI where you can sort of like
download the financial statement, pop it
into AI and say, "What do I need to
know?"
>> I think it's actually exacerbating the
situation.
>> Oh, spend a few beats on that
>> because now read the financial
statements, Anthony. I just put it into
AI. I asked Chat GPT to tell me, "What
about this? Look for that. Look for
that." And there's there's all the
instances of those things. and then I
just read it and it's all there. Well,
did the AI miss it? Did the AI
understand the linkages between each of
those sightings? If I'm if I'm looking
at, for example, I was looking at a
company recently and I was looking at it
was capitalizing costs. Okay, this is a
REIT. And if it capitalizes cost versus
putting them through the income
statement, if it goes through the income
statement, it makes their operating
earnings look poor, lower, and their net
EPS ultimately. But if they put it on
the balance sheet, well, you know,
that's an investment in the future and
everything looks okay, right? And so
there's a gray area. Was it an operating
expense or was it a capital item? And so
I was first thing I looked for was
capitalized interest. And so it gave me
all the quotes and then capitalized
costs and it gave me all the quotes. So
then you think that that's enough, but
you have to then and I and I was showing
one of my guys this. I said, "So then
let's go to the income. Let's actually
pull up the statements where it told us
to go because AI made it faster. I now
no longer needed to flip the 300 pages,
but it it gave me where to go. So now I
went there and now I could say well that
means if that is what's happened then we
need to look at this other note to see
what you know the implications of that
and then we got to look at the cash flow
statement to see how it's actually
impacting what ends up being reported as
as cash flow and so those linkages come
it the AI makes me get to the answer
perhaps more quickly but it's my if I
don't already know where I want to go
then AI just gives me information, but
that information doesn't help my
decision if I didn't start with where I
want to get to.
>> And it sounds like that information
doesn't help your decision if you don't
know the second, third, fourth order
consequence.
>> 100%. This is I love it. If that's where
investors go and that's where they're
going, everything is going to AI. The
the bottom level of being an analyst,
the junior analyst is is going to be
replaced by an AI. the one that said,
"Find me all the references of, you
know, where the company capitalized
costs." That the AI can do. I get it.
But you need someone with experience to
know what which of those references
matter and to what that means to the
business.
And this brings about a number of
challenges because well if that junior
person doesn't learn
doesn't get on the in on the ground
floor they'll never learn to be able to
make all those connections
>> and the only way to learn is sort of
like being in the weeds and not being in
a
>> Yes. In fact, it ties to so many things.
I I with my own children I've seen
growing up when we went to school and we
were in elementary school, we would be,
you know, we'd have to do the math
tables and and recite them.
>> Yeah. 2 * 2 is four and so on. I
remember I was struggled with my with my
nine times table and then my 12 times
table and so I had to memorize them and
get them going. But then my children
came along and they were using a
calculator and apparently that was okay.
I went bananas. I said, "You're not
going to use the calculator. You need to
learn it without the calculator and then
you can use the calculator, which is the
same with AI. You need to understand how
the financial statements are prepared,
understand the linkages, develop mental
models so that when the AI gives you
information, you can you can digest it
and make decisions. Reminds me of this
funny story. When I started university,
uh, I ended up in first year calculus
and for whatever reason, the professor
who was supposed to teach that class
couldn't teach it. So, the dean of the
math department took over. And on the
first class, in the first like minute,
he said, "There'll be no calculators in
this class." Oh,
>> nobody of course listened to him cuz
graphing calculator, you're like, "Oh my
god, this makes my life so much easier."
would show up to the final exam which is
like I think 80% of your final mark.
>> Yeah.
>> And on the front page it's no
calculators and he did not grade that on
a curve and it was not pretty for most
students.
>> I taught at university for about uh 14
years at York and uh truly one of a very
fulfilling time uh in my life and uh I
still love doing guest lectures. I
remember I I I would always start the,
you know, I would go over the outline
and I and I would tell the students, I
said, "So, assignments are due at the
beginning of class.
>> If they're handed in after the 8:30
start time, it's a zero. It's a zero."
And invariably
at some whether it was the first and
usually the first or second assignment,
somebody would show up and hand it in
late and I would say it's a zero.
>> Yeah. and they would whine and say it's
how can you do that and you're so
draconian and I say well you think in
the real world when an RFP is required
and you've signed with the contract with
a client that they demand the report by
9:00 a.m. on Monday and you show up at
9:05. How's that look?
And somehow it's okay. So, it wasn't
okay in my class. And and ultimately, I
think you you build respect because
people see that there's a rule and it's
followed and then people have respect
for the rule.
>> There's this sort of like weird
dichotomy I think with students right
now. And dichotomy is probably not the
right word. There's this weird
path where students are coming out and
they're more powerful and capable than
ever because they use AI by default
>> and so they can get more output than
somebody who's maybe been in their
career 15 20 years and I I use my
14year-old as an example. You know, in a
world where he never had to show up to
work, he's a mid-level employee at most
companies based on output. If you never
saw him, he can give you the the exact
same output that a mid-level employee is
going to give you if everything goes
right. But the minute something goes
wrong, he doesn't quite understand all
the nuances and all the and AI the I
guess the race for him is like will AI
catch up quicker, you know, because he
uses AI by default. And I sort of think
about this as like making a recipe,
right? Like if I pull out a cookbook and
I make a recipe and I do everything
perfectly, you wouldn't be able to tell
the difference between me and the chef.
Like the food, maybe it's not plated as
well, but it's going to taste great.
It's going to taste the same. You'd be
like, "This is amazing." But if
something goes wrong, if the oven's too
hot, if I don't stir enough, I don't put
enough salt in. I don't know why it
didn't go right. But the minute a chef,
the chef who created that recipe, who's
got all the experience, who did the, you
know, who's made it hundreds of times,
they taste it, they're like, "Oh, your
oven said 375, but it's actually 350.
You stirred this too much. You let this
boil. You They instantly know what went
wrong." Yes. And I wonder if in a world
of AI, that's the nuance. And I I was
talking to Steve Schwarzmann about this
in a different context. But he basically
said, you know, a lot of the analysts
coming up, they know the numbers, but
they don't know what the numbers mean.
>> Correct. Experience teaches you
judgment. And and you talk about this in
your book. It's all about the mental
models. I I I believe that strongly. The
experience teaches you what the numbers
mean as we've spoken about. And when you
have experience, you say, "I've seen
that before."
>> And a lot of the things I see happening
today link back to things I've seen when
I started my career over the last 30
years. And I think that's something that
the AI can't quite do unless you tell it
where to look because it doesn't know
the link that I'm thinking about, right?
But if I if I can make the initial
stage, it can help me get there quicker
and more accurately. But if I don't if I
don't already have a model of what I'm
looking for, it's not going to get
there.
>> What are you seeing today?
>> We're talking now equity markets. Is
that
>> Yeah. I think we're in uh what seems to
be, you know, and I I hate calling
things bubbles, but I think we're in a
period of extreme uh euphoria where the
numbers, the fundamentals, and
fundamentals is thrown around in the
investment industry like the the word
love is thrown around among humans. You
know, the fundamentals, well, someone
looks at the chart and sees that, you
know, it did a double bottom. Well,
that's the fundamentals. And someone
else says, you know, that they're
looking at the RSI or some other things
or someone else says they're just
looking at cash flow or someone's
looking at the multiple related to
earnings. And those are the
fundamentals. Well, at the, you know,
historically, and if we follow what what
Buffett says, the company is the present
value of its future cash flows. And how
do you develop those cash flows? Well,
you need to do a forecast on what it's
what what it's going to drive the
business. And so, that's what I think
the fundamentals are. And so when a
company today is not generating much in
free cash impact negative and yet the
market wants to trade it at a multiple
of its revenues
well then the company's valuations is
extracted from its current fundamentals
and trading based on some future
expectations. I've been asked you know
if you could have anything what would it
be? and I'd say tomorrow's newspaper
because then I'd know what was going to
happen and I would be able to invest on
that. And so we're all trying to do the
most the impossible figure out what's
going to happen tomorrow. And all I know
is I've seen that when you read and
speak to investors and they say that the
numbers don't matter and the financial
statements no longer matter because this
is changing the world. I say, "Well,
I've seen this before." You know, I saw
that Nortell was changing the world and
Lucent and Cisco and 360 networks. They
were building out the infrastructure of
the internet that we're using today.
But those companies don't exist anymore.
They built what they built and that
still exists, but they no longer exist.
Either bankrupt or folded into other
companies. Cisco still exists today, but
has never traded at it at its historical
uh valuation. And yet, it's a it's it's
a multiples bigger than it was back then
and by earnings and by revenue.
>> If you're a founder, you know, naming
your startup takes forever. You finally
land on the perfect name only to find
out that Peter from Delaware got to the

options. Pay up and fund Peter's
retirement or tack on random words until
your domain looks like a Wi-Fi password.

I guess what you're saying is the same
is we know this is the future, but it's
also the same in that we don't know who
the winners are going to be.
>> That's right. And and I think right now
the reason why I think we're in a in a
very high-risisk situation is because
the cost of the risk is priced very low
and that's when the risk is highest. And
so how do we look at that? When you look
at the uh the high yield bond spread,
the spread between the 10-year bond and
the high yield bond in the US, okay,
that's the non-investment grade bonds.
Well, that's the tightest, near the
tightest it's ever been,
>> which means that investors are willing
to lend money to non-investment grade
companies at a spread over what a
government bond is at a rate, which is
the tightest it's been practically in
history. So there's no risk priced into
the bond market. And then in the equity
markets, we use VIX, which is a measure
of volatility of the of the S&P 500. And
that is trading at a benign level. It's
not the lowest it's ever been, but it's
at a benign level. So in essence, what
investors are saying is there's no risk.
Everything's fine. Isn't that the
age-old wisdom of like don't fight the
Fed, though? For sure. the future is is
pretty clear at least in the short term.
But the implications of that are we I I
don't proclaim to know but interest
rates are coming down. I mean all the
governments want interest rates down,
>> right? They they want interest rates
down because because debts have have
continued to balloon in a period which
has been relatively buoyant uh by
historical standards and interest rates
uh they perceive interest rates are
going to go down. That's going to keep
on the buoyancy. Well, the central bank
and if you followed Powell despite all
the pressures coming from Trump to cut
rates, I mean Powell is going to cut
rates because he's concerned about
either the employment situation, right,
or the economic situation more broadly
>> or political pressure.
>> There's supposed to be a separation. And
it seem, you're right, but it seems like
he's actually noticing that because the
now all of a sudden we've seen some some
more strain in the in the employment
market. And that I think is what's
leaning him to believe, okay, now it's
time probably to start cutting rates.
>> What happens when we cut rates and
markets are at all-time highs? It could
become a situation of where you sell the
news because everybody was moving the
market up in anticipation of it
happening because the belief is as we
when we cut rates we provide more lowerc
cost capital to companies they put that
capital to work and it generates return.
Every company is only as good or as
stable or as strong as its customer
base. And if we're seeing that the
customer base of uh you know, let's call
it the average Joe, and I call that Joe
Sixpack. Uh he's a buddy of mine. We all
have a buddy, Joe Sixpack. And so if Joe
Sixpack is struggling,
then ultimately, how is everything going
to trickle down and create growth?
>> You know, I have a hard time reconciling
this, right? Because the the the
territory, the boots on the ground is a
lot of people are struggling. seems like
more people than at least in my adult
lifetime with the exception of maybe the
2008 financial crisis. And we have
markets at all-time highs.
>> Yep.
>> And we have inflation, core inflation
actually going up and we also have
governments uh with high unemployment
pushing interest rates down. And we have
this this really I don't make macro
predictions, but we have this really
interesting setup. And then on top of
that, like just from my like how I sort
of approach things, you have the
greatest investor of all time who has
built up uh I don't
>> what's yeah 400 billion by now or 350
billion. His largest cash holding as a
percentage of market cap I think ever. I
struggle to reconcile all of these
things into some coherent view of like
>> the the thing about the markets and
companies is they'll continue longer
than you and I will be alive. And so
when you're investing, it just depends
on your horizon.
And I think what's happening today is
investors have learned
and rightly so that every time the
market falls, it rallies back.
>> And I like the comment you made, Shane.
I'm not here to predict markets. Uh it's
a fool's game. Uh I don't know, you
know, I I wish I knew then I just buy
futures and make tons of money or short
them. But what instead I know is I'm
looking at the underlying companies and
except for some of the mag seven that
are growing to earnings, the smaller and
midcaps are not. When Walmart is telling
you that there's a problem with its
sales forecasts and Target is struggling
and Lululemon can't sell the same number
of pants and Starbucks is considering to
changing some of its pricing and some of
its its business model. you know, this
is Joe Sixpack and and Stevie Weinbox
that stepped up from Joe Sixback. You
have Stevie Weinbox in the middle. Um,
and I think they're the ones that are
struggling. And so it tells me that this
can continue and and markets can
continue going up for for any number of
amount of time because it's a function
of how much liquidity is in the market
as well. People have are if investors
have lots of cash, they'll continue to
invest. the people that you're seeing
that are making the most money today um
are not those that historically necess
in general I'm speaking the ones that
you hear about that have made money
historically we talk Ray Dalio we talk
about you mentioned of course Warren
Buffett and there was a there's a quote
that was that I that I learned uh over
time and it says during raging bull
markets knowledge is superfluous and
experience is a handicap
Because
if you have the the benefit of knowing
what happened in all the other blowups,
you know how painful it could be. But if
you've never experienced it and every
time something went wrong, it just
rallied back like nothing happened,
well, you think it's going to continue.
>> I guess the argument against that is
this time it's different, which is what
we always
>> which is the most dangerous words in in
life and in finance. one day want to
write a book that's that that marries
finance with life because it's it's it's
it's one and the same.
>> I remember this interview Alish
Schroeder did and she hasn't done many
interviews and one of the most
illuminating things that I remember from
that interview is that Buffett when he
was looking at patterns he wasn't trying
to identify what's different this time
he's trying to focus on what's the same.
>> Yes.
>> Talk to me about that. And so what I see
is the same. We actually put, you know,
I I transitioned the the forensic
accounting knowledge and and skill set
into what is today Veritas. And so
that's an independent equity research
firm and then later into also an asset
management arm. And all of that started
because we wrote a cell report on
Nortell in in 2000. And people thought
we were crazy. And you know, at the time
I was 29 years old. So, I didn't realize
what I was actually doing. It's amazing
when we're young. But
>> you didn't realize the impact of what
you were doing.
>> I didn't like where
>> you knew the accounting.
>> I knew what I was looking at, but didn't
realize that if you dropped said pebble
into the water, what happens? And then
when John Roth gets quoted in the
newspaper that we're hurting his ability
to raise capital and clients are
cancelling and you know employees are
contacting us upset because of the
things we're saying and it's like I
didn't mean to hurt anybody. I'm just
saying the truth hence the name Veritas.
So let's link to what I think some of
the the the linkages from the past. So
at the time you had Nortell and you had
Cisco and you had Lucent and they were
building out various components parts of
the internet and what they would do was
they needed customers. Well the
customers needed to raise money cuz if
you're going to build infrastructure
you're not going to generate cash flow
for some time. So they would raise money
from equity holders and eventually get
some debt but the powers that be at
Lucent and Nortell would also offer
them. So they would say buy this $10
million worth of product and why don't
you pay me over some extended period of
time. Oh, and by the way, we'll give you
a line of credit so that you need 10
million from us of of cable. Uh, but
we'll you can also you need to buy some
routers from Cisco. You know what? We'll
give you some line of credit so you
could do that because Nortto could
borrow money could could had a great
balance sheet could raise money
whatever. And so that's what was
happening. Well, ultimately when the
equity market started to wobble and
there was no one left to continue to
make sales to, right? Well, then now all
of a sudden Nortell didn't get paid on
its debts and the wheels came off and
then the 360 networks and JDS unif
mentioned they went by the wayside. And
so what ended up sort of now let's take
that and think about what's happening
today. So you have the likes of the
Nvidias of the world and let's say
Microsoft and you have Open AI and such
and Nvidia is investing in Open AI.
>> Mhm.
>> And Microsoft is an investor in Open AI.
Microsoft offers cloud services to Open
AI. So it's a customer. So OpenAI
becomes a customer of Microsoft. But
Microsoft gave it the money so that it
could actually pay it back. Nvidia
invests in OpenAI and Nvidia is a a a
supplier of chips to open AAI. So it's
all circular. What's going on here?
There's a new company that just went
public earlier this year, Cororeweave,
who is its largest customer. Coreeave
provides data transaction like analysis
of on chips, right? It's a data farm for
the large AI users like Microsoft. Its
largest customer is Microsoft. Microsoft
hasn't invested in it, but Nvidia
supplies pretty much all its chips.
Well, Nvidia is a large or is a
meaningful investor in Coreave. Corewave
goes public.
It's trying to close its its equity, its
financing. on the last moment, Nvidia
buys $250 million worth of shares of
Cororeweave so that it could close the
deal. These are, you know, JP Morgan
gives them a loan so that they could
just before they go public and then they
go public and repay the loan to JP
Morgan who's the one of the lead
underwriters, JP Morgan. No one's doing
anything bad. No one's cheating. It's
just these are all the same type of
symptoms of things that were going on
way back some 25 years ago. All these
things don't mean anything. Nothing
means anything until it means something.
I say, you know, the things that we're
talking about right now, these little
things, if you will, you know, in the
time of 2000s, just like we talked about
Enron, that didn't have the disclosure.
So, the key wrinkle to everything I
brought up, and that's why now I want to
take it to the accounting is the
financial statements of Nortell
>> didn't show that long-term loan as a
part of current assets. It showed it as
part of long-term assets. So, when the
simple calculation of current ratios,
they would only take well current
assets. And so, this long-term asset
that wouldn't show up as part of the
liquidity calculation. It also wouldn't
show up as part of operating cash flow.
And if it's not part of operating cash
flow, then operating cash flow looks
better. And no one would look at
long-term receivables.
>> And what they would because they're
taught in their CFA, how do you
calculate free cash flow? Operating cash
flow less capex. But this is the problem
with when you just create the ratio and
invest by ratio. The ratio needs to be
adapted to the company, the life cycle,
the industry, the business model. If the
company's selling things at a long-term
receiv over a period of extending beyond
one operating cycle, but it's part of
its normal operations, that should be
part of operating cash flow. And in
fact, after after Nortell, Fazby changed
the rules and then long-term receivables
became part of operating and short-ter
and and and current assets. And that's
something we wrote about. We said this
is wrong. You need to the free cash flow
is actually negative because this number
needs to be shown. So they're extremely
vulnerable to something going wrong if
the customer can't make payments. And
today, now let's look at the accounting
today. Nvidia would make that investment
in in core. It's such a small
meaningless dollar amount to the balance
sheet of Nvidia
>> that the num amount of disclosure is
irrelevant. It it's a it's a related
party. Now, we only own 5% so that's not
material to to Nvidia and the dollar
amount to Nvidia's total balance sheet
is also immaterial. So, it doesn't
matter. But if this is happening over
hundreds of transactions where it's
making investments like this in its own
customers, then what ends up happening
if all of a sudden it runs out of the
ability to get cash or the customers end
up having problems selling services with
the chips that it buys, then kind of
things start to fall uh fall apart.

>> Again, it is it is fantastic business
savvy. You want if I'm trying to create
a new paradigm which is AI then I in
order to foster that paradigm I need to
invest in it
>> as a as the key player in it. And what
ends up happening if you see that my
name as a key investor and and a leader
in this industry is making an investment
in this company. Well, then what does
everybody else do? Warren Buffett tells
you he's buying something. What does
everybody do? They go buy it. Well, if
Nvidia is buying something, what do all
the private equity firms do looking
around? Well, that's a good one.
>> There's another one. It's on Corenser
Weave, like the AMD equivalent, which is
private now. So I would imagine they
would all
>> exactly
>> pile into that.
>> You got it.
>> Yeah. This Nortell report I want to come
back to this for a sec. So you dropped
this report and you happen to be
correct.
What responsibility
you know remember the Superman quote
with great power comes great
responsibility.
>> I tell you Spider-Man.
>> Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Yeah.
>> I love that quote.
>> And I wonder about these things like
when you're right it's great but what
about when you're wrong? And that's one
of the things uh you know we're
celebrating our 25th anniversary this
year and uh I developed 10 uh rules
investing rules and they they relate to
life as well but uh one of them is being
negative sounds intelligent.
>> Being negative typically is looking at
facts. It's looking at numbers. It's
presenting them to you in a way that
says, "Wow, that seems really
compelling. If I want to sell you
something that is you know that so
that's the negative side. If I want to
sell you the positive side well then I
got to sell you the dream. AI is going
to change the world. People are going to
be no are no longer going to need to
work. We're it's going to replace jobs.
Margins are going to go higher. There's
going to create you know it's it's going
to improve health care services. All the
the phenomenal things that could
potentially happen. And so you'd see
that and then you're willing to invest.
It's you're buying a dream. But if I
tell you, yeah, but a lot of this is
based on all these intricate
transactions where there's no disclosure
about you go, ah, that doesn't matter,
Anthony. Look, we're changing the world,
buddy. I like to say none of these
things matter until they matter. And
then when they matter, they matter a
lot. You know, with great power comes
great responsibility. You're right. This
should not be interpreted as I'm telling
that something's going to blow up. I'm
just saying that there are some
linkages, things we've seen in past
euphoric times. Things could continue
for any number of periods. I I don't
know. But we're getting to a point, as I
said earlier, where there's very little
cost to risk today.
>> What are the 10 investing rules?
>> Oh, now you're going to put me on the
spot. I I I don't I I don't remember all
of them. Uh
>> why don't you give me some of them? The
number one rule, and I borrow this from
from Warren, and so if he ever, you
know, he's not going to pay attention to
listen to me, but I did reach out to
him. His number one rule is don't lose
money. And my concern with don't lose
money is any investment requires the
absorption of risk. And so if you're not
willing to take some level of risk,
which means potentially to lose money,
you won't make money either. So you
don't want to invest with a from a from
a position of fear.
>> You want to invest I think so my number
one rule is avoid embarrassing loss. You
want to avoid the loss of a company
potentially blowing up. If the company
might you know if it looks like it's a
little bit expensive and it might and it
might go potentially go down 5% or
something or 10% or 20. Okay, you can
deal with that. But if you're investing
in a company where if something goes
wrong, you could wake up one day and
it's down 20 or 50%. That's the one you
don't want to have in your portfolio
because investors will never invest with
you again.
And you'll also be scarred because
people make investments. This is why
it's so difficult to be to be a
long-term sound investor because
emotions get in the way, which is one of
my rules. emotion has no place in
investing. Another rule is uh don't
trust management. I'm sure there's many
management teams and I run my you know
we're a operating business uh private
company and it's not that they you know
you you shouldn't trust anything they
say but again it's it's a mindset. Uh
everything you do is is about how you
pos you you present your your mindset
going in. And so if you go in with the
mindset of don't trust, then you'll be
curious. Then you're going to ask
questions. It's not that you you think
that they're bad people. I didn't say
they're bad people. I said just don't
trust. Verify and then trust. And then
another rule would be that you have to
read the notes to the financial
statements first before you actually
read the statements. The notes to the
financial statements tell you how the
company modified the accounting because
it ch it made accounting choices. We
decided to account for this these type
of transactions in this way so that when
you look at the financial statements
once you know how they're prepared you
can better interpret them. Accounting is
a language. If I said to you tomorrow
you're going to speak Spanish. Oh you
know you could do AI and you figure it
out and you're going to learn it. But
the nuances of the language, an
individual who did a PhD in that
language, they're going to understand
way more about the language than you
are. The same like reading the financial
statements. The more you understand of
what went into them and how they're
prepared, the better you're going to
interpret them. What are the red flags
you look for? I like the way you you
posed the question because it sets up
what I we've learned over time. The
problem with red flags is it gets to
your point that you started at before
where you don't want to be crying wolf.
And so I've learned to temper because
you could be wrong.
>> Mhm.
>> It's not red flags. We call them
flammable items.
>> Okay.
>> So this goes to the pro our process.
It's a three-stage process that we use
and we teach because one of our we have
Veritasu and so we teach investors how
to make better investment decisions. And
so the the first stage is you understand
the business and the control
environment. Okay, again understand and
understand the accounting that's being
used so that when you study the
financial statements, everything else,
they all make sense and you understand
sort of the the the structure, how is
management compensated, what stage of
their life cycle are they at? Because
those are all sort of constraints and
opportunities within the business. So
then you look for a flammable item. For
example, companies generating negative
cash flow. That could be by itself a red
flag in the normal way. This this type
of I would call forensic analysis is
taught unless you know. So if a
company's generating negative cash, it
may actually be a fantastic thing.
They're investing in an AI startup that
is going to be a huge opportunity. and
they've shown over time that the return
on invested capital is in excess of 20%
or 50% or whatever it is. And so they're
investing in something. Yes, it's
negative cash flow today. But I'm not
investing for the cash flow today. I'm
investing for the cash flow tomorrow. So
you see that as a red flag, you don't
invest in it. And unless you understood
the first part, which was the fact that
where they are in their life cycle, type
of business, etc., that is now not a red
flag. It's just a flammable item by
itself. Not a problem. It depends. And
then you get to the third bucket, which
is the spark. And so you're always
looking for a spark because let's use
that same negative cash flow. Well, if
all of a sudden a new competitor comes
into that company's operating space,
okay, and is able to take market share,
>> now all of a sudden that negative cash
flow is a problem. If you notice in the
financial statements when you look at
that negative cash flow, the company's
taken on very expensive debt. Again,
very expensive debt by itself doesn't
mean anything because if the potential
return on invested capital is higher
than that cost of capital, it's all
good. But if a new peer comes in play,
now all of a sudden that model may not
work. And now you have a blowup. In my
podcast, the FactFinders, I I
interviewed uh an individual who we've
used before, private investigator, and
he's the one that got me onto this this
way of this mental model. And uh he
says, you know, if the CEO uh beats his
wife and runs stop signs, kicks his dog,
doesn't get along with the neighbors,
probably could be a problem. But that's
not going to show up in the financial
statements. That's not going to show up
in any interviews. You got to kind of
follow things that are going on. What is
that organization stand for? How are
they operating? What are their values?
But not just what they write down. The
culture and the values are not what you
read on the financial statements and in
their in their press releases. We wrote
about Valiant. We said sell Valiant.
Okay? We're the only cell on on Valiant
in 2012 2013. The company didn't blow up
until 2015. Okay? But they and they
would talk about their integrity and
their, you know, how they were changing
the world with the with the drug
reformulations they were doing and so
forth. But if you look deeper, they were
just manipulating the accounting and
changing the pricing on on drugs and
creating a fraudulent network of
onlineies.
>> Valiant's a good one because there's a
lot of uh well-known investors in that.
>> Yeah. How did so many well-known
wellrespected investors go wrong? People
who are known for their due diligence,
people who are known for their leg work.
I know I sat with them talked to them
before the c before it's a situation
where someone is such a masterful
spinner of a story and is
>> are you talking to the CEO
>> the CEO and the management team sold you
had Mike Pearson.
>> Yeah.
>> And was executing and you know he comes
he came from a great pedigree. He was
not taking a salary and everything was
tied to the stock price. you know, he he
was, you know, for tires tirelessly
working in the company and he'd proven
because what ends up happening is price
creates narrative.
>> Mhm.
>> So all of a sudden you don't believe it
day one,
>> but then you see that they made an
acquisition. It didn't seem like it was
going to work, but then it works and the
stock price goes higher and then they do
something else and it kind of seems a
little bit strange. And then they
changed their accounting and and they
changed the way they rec they they
present their op their uh non-gash gap
metrics which is things we noticed like
that's another huge flammable item. The
company says you know they're reporting
their they use an adjusted IBIDA and
they calculate it in a certain way and
then the following year they calculate
it a different way. Well that's a non
audited number. It's a it's whatever
management wants and you know the
markets just believe it. And so that's
something that Valiant was notorious
about, but didn't matter because the
stock price just kept going higher. And
as the stock price keeps going higher,
it's very difficult. Okay, in in the
money management industry, when you're
underperforming, it is so difficult to
stay the course. M
>> you saw this you know in the financial
crisis that movie about you know the big
short like those individuals were became
clients of ours like I know Porter
Collins if he ever listens here and and
Danny and so forth like we we befriended
each other during during this time of
madness and afterwards it was like they
were crazy like you end up looking at
yourself going I'm crazy I'm seeing this
and nobody cares it becomes so difficult
When you're on the other side now,
you're trying to make money and raise
money from clients because investors now
are saying, "Well, wait a minute. You're
up five or you're down five, market's up
20. You don't know what you're doing.
What are you doing?" And, you know, it's
hard because that's how you earn your
living. That I think becomes the becomes
the problem. And with Valiant, it just
went on for so long.
And you need to look at the market
conditions at the time because the
people are running a business but the
business is operating in a certain
economic environment. Well, you had
brand new bond market activity. QE. No
one ever heard of QE before the early
2000 or 2010s. The bank, the the central
banks were buying longdated bonds to
keep interest rates low. Well, now all
of a sudden, what does that do to a
company like Valiant that's making
that's growing through acquisition and
needs capital? Well, they could borrow
money at very low rates. And if that's
the case, then their IRR, cost of
capital, etc. The hurdle rate is very
low. So, they look really great. all
these transactions that may not have
made made any sense in other time
periods when risk-f free rates were not
you know in the 1 or 2% range all of a
sudden they make sense if I had to go
back in time we should have said buy
valiant
at the beginning because we had studied
biovail so bio valiant bought val
biovail biovail was a Canadian company
>> that was run by Eugene Melnik
And we wrote a cell report on on that
company in in the early 2000s. And and
the company ended up being a figment of
its former self. And but it had
something it had some formulations for
of drugs which were elongated in their
uh release. So they they would buy a
drug and then repurpose the the the
formulation. So there'll be slow release
etc. And then they and they also had
phenomenal tax structure where they were
set up in Barbados and Barbados is like
heaven. So the more money you make as
income, you pay a lower percentage tax.
Imagine that. So what Valiant did was
they bought that structure when they
bought Biovail.
>> And so that allowed them to extract all
the cost of tax. So many interesting
things they did. They set up their head
office in Quebec province in Canada,
French speakaking. Well, the case, which
is the largest, one of the largest
pension plans in Canada, right? Their
mandate is not just to make money for
its pensioners, okay? And there, this is
the civil pension fund, one of and I
think second largest in Canada behind
CPP. And one of their mandates is to
invest in Quebec-based companies and
foster growth. It's a phenomen. I used
to think it was a problem, but actually
I've changed my way. I think CPP should
do the same. CPP should be encouraged to
invest in Canada. The US pension plan
should buy US companies. Encouraged to
do that. Anyway, so in this case, you
set up in Quebec, you know, you've got a
set flow of capital that's going to come
from this Quebecbased pension plan. And
I remember meeting with the with the
leaders at the case at the time talking
about this and they're like, "We don't
want to own it. We're we we agree with
you, Anthony. We're worried about all
this stuff." But these are the
subtleties that you need like every
again when you see it's a flammable. You
didn't even know that was a flammable
item unless you know from the first
page, oh, they're set up in Quebec. And
you go, why did that happen? which is
part of the mental model of being
curious to say nothing happens without a
reason. If you notice something and you
go, "Well, that seems really weird. No
one else does that." And most people
just say, "Well, it's okay. It doesn't
matter." Well, actually, that's what
matters.
>> Is complicated just in general like a
red flag for you? I remember Buffett and
Munger got entailed with something with
the SEC in the early '7s. I think it was
their structure was just it was uh
legal. It was rational. It was not
transparent if I recall correctly. It
was incredibly complicated
and they ended up simplifying it, but
they weren't doing anything wrong.
>> So again, I've, you know, sat with
management teams and you go through
their 10K and then you see a list of all
their operating subsidiaries and you see
the different places that they're
operating. Again thing about investing
today is there's so much pressure on the
analysts to cover more stocks.
>> The money management fees today are a
fraction of what they were even a decade
ago.
>> Right?
>> So the companies that are doing the
investing, the fixed cost of doing
investing, like paying the audit, doing
the back office, all that stuff, yes,
it's come down a bit, but it's still
there.
>> Yeah. All that's been squeezed is the co
the the cost of the money management. So
they're having to look for shortcuts and
that means just give me the number,
Anthony. Just give me that one number. I
just want that one number and then you
get the one number that management gives
them and then they just accept that and
move on.
>> I was talking and I'm not going to
mention who I was talking to a
well-known CFO once about earnings
management.
>> Yes. and they said, you know, we would
call analysts after the earnings call
and we would, you know, legally, but we
would definitely lead them uh to what
numbers to expect for the next quarter
even if we weren't and we would
sometimes manipulate that if we wanted
to. And I always thought that that was a
bit nefarious, but I mean this is how
people work and how the world works. So
just being, you know, to I think you
asked the question, is being complicated
a a problem? Well, it's just why is it
happening? And you go back to nothing
happens without a reason. Then you point
to some company operating in the British
Virgin Islands that's listed on the list
and go, what does this company do?
>> Yeah.
>> And management starts sweating and say,
why are you asking that? I don't know.
You have your answer before you ask a
question. Do you get to a point where
things are like too complicated? People
don't even know what's going on. Like it
it always starts with like this one
thing makes sense and but over you know
30 40 years you end up with this
structure that nobody even internally
probably understands.
>> You know they they interviewed um fast
Andrew Fastau who is the CFO of of Enron
and he's done many an interview on this.
Also I I because when we do our training
we have a few of these interviews that
we that we quote and it's companies
don't start out as being crooked. They
have to convince someone to buy a
product okay or a service. So money
comes in to the company in some fashion
or time and then gets converted into
something that adds value.
The problem becomes outside stakeholders
come in and say, "Well, I need you to
make X because you want my money. Well,
I'll give you my money so long as you
give me this return." Well, that works
until there's a problem. And now there's
no CEO that wants to disappoint.
So, it's very simple. The CFO comes to
talk to me. I'm the CEO. And he says,
"Look, I know uh Anthony, we were going
to make a dollar, but we're coming in at
95." And I say to him, "You get back to
your room and find me 5 cents."
>> Yeah.
>> You like your job. You like your kids
going to private school. You like your
stock options, how much they're worth.
You see all these employees we have,
they we give them stock as a part of
their compensation every quarter. Like
that's a problem. We can't disappoint.
And then it starts
>> and it starts slowly.
>> It always starts slowly. And look, there
>> that was what Andy said in in the I
think correct those interviews. It's
like, you know, it started with a little
bit and I figured next quarter I could
bring it back
>> and it's just, you know, that's the
thing. Life is a dangerous thing this
way. Whether we push something even in
life, right? You know, well, look, if I
smoke a bit or drink a bit or tell this
little lie, you know, no one notices and
I'm I'm okay. Well, then maybe I do a
little bit more of each one of those
things and no one notices and then it's
all good, right? But then switching
gears a little bit, do companies that
report free cash flow on their press
releases or in their financial
statements tend to outperform?
>> I don't have that data.
>> What would be your guess? It's not a
common metric to report.
>> My guess is I would say not necessarily
no. I would say no.
>> What do you think of ibida? IDA is the
mother of all disastrous
measures.
>> Why?
>> Because of what investors want to
believe that it is and that it's
something that is cash flow that it's
something that can be compared to de
total debt and it is not. It is purely a
operating performance metric
calculated before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization. That's
it. Now what runs into a problem is well
what do I do with stock options? What do
I do with joint venture gains? What do I
do with gains on investments that I made
that I happen to sell this year? What do
I do with the charges that I took on
that acquisition that I bought this year
that I included in my ibita the profits
but at the cost that associated with
that operate that transaction should I
include that in ITA
>> aren't those onetime costs
>> if making acquisitions is part of my
business model
>> I no longer one-time costs this gets us
back to we have a course called the
secrets of free cash flow and that's
been our most watched uh and taught
course and that's because it started we
said it earlier we said free cash flow
is operating cash flow less capex but
it's not it depends every every answer
that someone asks you what is what
should it be well it depends
>> depends on the company
>> you got it how should I calculate it
well it depends what decision do you
need to make you always start with the
facts before you think about a
transaction and how you're going to
account for it it's all about the facts
the constraints and the objectives,
right? The facts determine what did I
sell, what did I buy, from who, at what
cost, under what terms, etc. So, those
are the facts broadly. Then I have the
constraints. Well, I'm a private
company. Who uses the statements? Well,
just me and my partners. Who cares where
I put it? It's less less important. But
if there's an outside onlooker on this,
well, now it matters because they're
looking at it. I now have outside
investors. I have debt. I have a debt
covenant. All of those things. I'm
public now. I have the SEC. Those are
all constraints. I operate in the US. I
got FASBY, PCAOB. I operate in Canada. I
have IFRS. I have CPAB. And the last is
the objectives. I want to sell my
business this year. And my business
sells on IBATA. Buddy, I'll tell you how
I'm going to account for it. My business
investors want free cash flow. I'll tell
you how we're going to account for it.
It's those three points.
When I teach accounting, I teach those
three things.
>> That's fascinating. I want to talk stock
options for a little bit. You brought
that up. I want to come back to this.
Like, how should investors think about
stock options today? And then how would
you change accounting rules to better
account for stock options? Two separate
questions, but
>> Shane, you're good.
>> I hate them personally in public
companies. However, I I understand why
companies want to use them. I mean, my
take is there, you know, if you look at
most buybacks, they're just covering up
stock options.
>> Correct. Very good.
>> So, that's an expansion.
>> I think that uh stock options what they
do every it comes down to human
motivation. So if I am going to
compensate you on the stock price, then
you're going to make decisions that move
the stock price. In my early classes
when I teach um I I always say that
economy and economics reality is way
over here as far as I can see with my
hand and the accounting is way over
there as far as I can go with my hand.
Because if for example,
you know, I'm going to take a very
simple manufacturing company because
everybody understands that we make pens.
We drive pens. We're making a,000 pens
an hour. And I sell the pen. You sell,
you know, today we made, you know, over
eight hours made 8,000 pens. One of my
salespeople sells a,000 pens. Well, how
do I calculate the cost of that,000
pens? Do I just take the 8,000 pens that
I do, divide, take 1,000 over 8,000,
that's the total cost, and then that's
what I allocate? Right? The reality is I
sold them a,000 pens and it was the last
thousand.
Do I stop the press, figure out the cost
of that last thousand? Do I average it?
Do I, even though I sold them the last
ones, do I calculate the cost of the
first thousand, which may be a little
bit higher because there were some setup
cost to change my machine to make the
thousand. M
>> all of those three options I gave you a
business reality for what the accounting
is FIFO LIFO or average cost. So the
reality is I sold them the last
thousand. The accountant said well we
want to show high margin so we're going
to use average and that's all good. That
ties that point. But I want to get to
your question because I I don't think I
I I got on a sidetrack and I want to
answer your question about stock
options. So I think stock options should
be an expense and if they're not an
expense I I borrow from Buffett and even
the chair of accounting has said things
like this that that if it's not an
expense then what is it? You can choose
to pay someone in stock options or you
can choose to pay them in cash. So if I
pay all my employees, you pay, you have
the same company, you're we're a
competitor. You pay all your employees
with stock options. I pay them in cash.
I have a lower EBIDA. I have a lower
EPS. Your stock trades higher than mine.
Stock price goes down. All of a sudden,
all your employees leave and they want
to come work for me. And all my guys are
pretty happy. They don't care. So you
should include it as an expense. taking
this one step further to and why I
brought up reality and accounting is
that as an employee at any level even
the CEO and CFO sure the things they say
the things they do will affect market's
perception of the company perhaps in the
near term perhaps in the medium term but
in the in the longer term in the in the
fullness of time the results will prove
what's going to happen but the
management and and the the guy on the
shop floor even the sales manager may
have no impact on what actually happens
in the stock price. Yesterday, Powell
cuts rates. So, that moves the company's
price. All of a sudden, as an employee,
I'm better off or worse off. But, I had
no effect on that. I had no nothing to
do with that. A new peer enters the
enters our business uh in our in our as
a new competitor. I have no effect on
that. All of a sudden, GDP slows down.
My business isn't even affected because
the GDP is tied more to consumption
problems. My business is a B2B business
that's totally outside of being affected
by current G GDP movements and my stock
price falls. I had no control over that.
So I think it it incentivizes what I
think the wrong thing is and makes
people make potential decisions which
can manipulate the stock price which may
or may not be good for the company.
>> So do you adjust I guess for options?
You just consider them an expense. you I
I think that you know options are are
super interesting because a lot of
companies that report profits aren't
actually profitable if you factor in the
stock options and I had a friend who
actually put me onto this about 10 years
ago and I was visiting his factory he
doesn't give a stock options I was like
well how do you compete he's like well I
I mean I hire the best people and you
know they tell me they they have stock
options at their company and it's a
public company I'll give you the options
on their company.
>> Oh. On their stock.
>> On their stock. Not my company or my
stock. And I'll pay you in cash and I'll
give you a cash bonus.
>> And so this is how he recruited all the
best people.
>> Wow.
>> And one of the interesting things about
this was after that meeting, I was like,
I wonder where if I went fishing, like
you talk about fishing a pond, right?
>> And if I could increase the ratio of
what I'm looking at to be solid. And so
I looked for companies that stopped
stock options.
And there's not many of them, but when
you find one, it's usually like a good
place to start looking for an
investment.
>> Yeah, that's a that's a good point.
>> What do you think of other incentives
and inside companies
>> such as
>> I don't know like what else drives sort
of like a lot of either good or bad
incentives? Like what do you if you only
had access to financial reporting, uh,
management reporting, conference calls,
like what are the things on the calls
that you would look for? What are the
things
>> I'm going to look for? Okay, so for to
answer your question is about what what
incentives do I think are are make
sense? Well, you look at what the key
measures of success are for the company
and do those align with investors
interest. So investors are cons are care
about the company longevity, its ability
to generate cash, its ability to grow
and sustain itself. And if the company's
incentives aren't linked to that, so if
they're not tied to, you know, cost
control, if they're not tied to uh
driving revenues from an organic
standpoint, not just from acquisitions,
um if they're not, you know, if they're
if they're ti if they're driven by
acquisition, but with no care to what's
going on on the balance sheet, um that's
a problem. I would say, you know, it's
it's not easy to say that there's I hate
I'm sorry, but one here's the one thing
and it's going to work. But I think it's
it's one where is it consistent? Did it
change?
>> Did a company say, you know, we're going
to pay management on X performance
metric. If they hit it, they get 100%.
If they don't, they get some graduated
scale. Well, then management doesn't hit
it and they change the the metric and
management still gets a bonus. I think
that's a problem.
>> Oh, totally. Yeah.
>> Because now what that does is it says
that's that everything's okay.
>> And you know it's hard again now I'm a
board. See the the more you learn and
the more experience you have you
understand more about what you don't
know and that there's a lot of things to
learn. Well the board is making these
decisions and everybody say oh the
board's bad and boards are bad. think
well no the board wants to retain the
CEO and often times you know that could
be a very significant personality
and that personality may you know
there's other companies that want that
individual to work there so they have to
retain them and often times money is is
is retaining that's something that
becomes a problem
>> what is the role of the board
>> the role of the board is to embrace the
position uh and and the and the
viewpoint of the shareholder andor the
stakeholder. I we always always focus on
the shareholder but stakeholder
stakeholders employees uh customers the
communities the company works in the
competitors
and embrace each of those and ensure
that the company is making decisions or
that the executive is making decisions
in the best interests of those
stakeholders. oftent times they just
focus on you know shareholder value.
>> Well what is shareholder value? Is that
just something that we can calculate on
the financial statements or calculate
into the stock price or is that that
they've built a vibrant employee base
that is growing and everyone and has a
great culture that regardless of what's
going to happen in the stock price
they're going to get through it. Are
they focused on uh you know in the in
the communities in which they operate
and ensuring that they sustain
themselves? Because if they're just
milking that community or that
environment wherever they're working,
well then what happens when they've
finished milking it? Are is that
business going to be able to continue?
And so it's something I've spoken on
before this and I so I think it's more
than just shareholder value calculated
that way. How do you think most board
members get selected?
>> Oftentimes, uh, by relationships,
>> going back to humans run companies.
>> That's correct.
>> I'm going to ask you to be on my board.
If I like you, think you're going to
agree with me.
>> And you know, look, we we have a a
board. We also have a a found a board in
our foundation. And I want to bring on
people that are going to make us better.
>> That might mean that some conversations
are not always, "Yes, Anthony. Yes,
Anthony. I I like I I actually don't
want that. I I want even in my my own
partners and my own employees, I I
welcome please come in. The door's open.
Tell me what I'm doing wrong. We're not
going to get better. I'm not going to
get better if someone doesn't tell me
I'm I'm I'm doing something wrong.
>> That is an uncommon view.
>> But it's the only way to progress, I
believe. I'm not saying that we're going
to decide what you said, but I want to
hear it. If you don't and and then and
the danger they say, "Well, if you
listen to it and then don't do anything
about it, then it's like you disregarded
it." I said, "No, you listen to it and
you go back to the person, thanks for
the input. Here's what we've decided to
do as a result of what you've said."
>> Yeah.
>> And then they feel like they were part
of it.
>> What do you think of the rise of
indexing? I think it's what do they I
don't know the exact stat but the a huge
percentage of money now is is passively
invested in ETFs of one form or another
and we've never seen this concentration
invested in say blindly because I mean
indexing works though and it works it
has worked over a long period of time
>> again you know the price creates a
narrative and so if indexing works then
why not do it the danger I think we're
having of the index investing, passive
investing, is that in essence, all that
is is momentum investing because it's a
you're buying an index which is market
cap weighted. So the money that you're
investing is going to the largest market
cap companies. Those companies continue
to grow. They drag the index higher. You
know, there's really two indexes.
There's the MAG 7 and the sloppy 493.
And so if you look at the earnings
expectations of the slot before 93 for
this year, there's virtually no growth.
But if you look at the growth of the
MAG7, it continues to go higher.
And so I think that the the danger is
that if that reverses, I'm not saying
it's going to reverse, but if that slows
then all of a sudden what's been
dragging the index higher will drag the
index lower in the same veracity
>> because they are the largest cap. So if
you know if one of the large if if
Microsoft were to miss and I'm not
saying they're going to miss anything
but if they if their earning growth
slows
>> right
>> all of a sudden the stock falls like
>> well we saw this in April right we saw
this huge draw down in a very short
period of time
>> you know the thing about those draw
downs because each of the drawdowns that
draw down occurred because Trump put
together a tablet he came down from
Mount Olympus brought down a tablet
Right. I have a picture of it that I use
in my presentations and showed how much
the the tariff he was going to charge on
all these countries and that created
immediate fear in the market, right?
Costs of companies were going to go up,
transaction were going to go down,
revenues get hurt, margins get hurt,
stock prices get hammered. But what the
the second third level thinking on that
is, well, wait a minute, these haven't
been enacted.
There's still time. Maybe they don't
happen. And if they don't happen, well,
maybe all this draw down doesn't mean
anything.
>> Yeah.
>> So, it's like an ex exogenous impact on
the market. It wasn't something that the
market fell on itself.
>> What I think would cause a a more a
downturn similar more like what happened
in '08 or even even in the early 2000s.
Like people forget that in the early
2000 they say, "Oh, the 2000 crash."
Well, actually the market was lower in
203 than it was in 2000, but everyone
thinks that it happened in 2000. It
actually didn't. It began. It's like
that's when it started,
>> right?
>> Kept going for years.
>> And the other ones have been relatively
fast even in the financial crisis. That
that one actually the peak was in ' 07.
>> In September 07, that was the peak. And
the bottom was March 09. That's a lot of
That's a lot of pain. That's 18 months
of pain. If you look at what what I
think could make this one be a longer
one if it if something were to occur is
it comes from earnings slowing down
>> and earnings growth slowing down.
>> That would be something that would take
longer to repair especially when a lot
of the earnings are interconnected as I
talked about because the companies are
dealing with each other.
>> It's not like one thing you can you know
you have this band-aid you rip it off.
It's like the slow
>> Yes. Yes.
>> reorienting.
>> You know, we've seen there there's
meaningful changes that are going on
here, right? Like Lululemon is trading
at a low much lower price today than it
was last year.
>> Let's talk about stock buybacks.
>> Share count doesn't necessarily go down,
but buybacks are happening.
>> It's the same as stock options in a
sense and the disparity between reality,
economic reality, and what's going on in
the accounting. So when you buy back
stock, the company is making a
investment in a security.
>> Mhm.
>> Which it partially has control over what
it does, but it doesn't have full
control over what happens to that
investment value. Whereas if it takes
its cash and buys an an operating asset
that expands its current production and
if it's already generating a meaningful
return, then that return should continue
>> and expand. So to me, it's a it's a
point that says I have no other
investments in my business that would
generate a return higher than my cost of
capital. And so I'm going out and buying
my stock and I think that is very risky.
>> How should investors look at that or
account for that?
>> I'm not so concerned about the
accounting stock buyback.
>> So if you're saying they should
investment though,
>> I understand. So I I think what they
should do is they should look at
earnings
on a pre.
So look at the earnings that the
company's generating. Before you divide
it by the number of shares,
>> okay,
>> to see is that number growing,
>> okay?
>> Relative to the revenues,
>> right?
>> Because now you're seeing uh is it or is
it just coming from a reduction of stock
number of shares outstanding? And if the
company's taking on debt, here's the
classic example.
company generates uh the company borrows
money to buy back stock. Why? Because
because it's such an a highly perceived
value company and generates cash, it can
borrow money and at a very low price and
invest it in in its own stock, which has
historically generated a greater return
than how much it has to pay in debt.
Well, this works until it doesn't
because if for some reason the business
changes or just slows its growth, which
could be just a natural evolution, like
part of this is the law of large
numbers. Okay? And if this happens, then
all of a sudden that debt doesn't go
away. And what looked like a very low
cost is now a meaningful cost that
doesn't leave. And I look at Apple and
this is what concerns me. Revenues
aren't growing
minimal. And yet it generates meaningful
cash because it has a brand. People are
still willing to pay $2,000 for a new
phone.
There's a lot of competitors
and I'm not sure that that will continue
forever at the same rate. In fact, it's
already slowing and that debt that
they've taken on to buy all back all
those shares to generate that EPS
growth,
>> that could end up being a problem if
they instead took that money and went
out and bought businesses, operating
businesses within its network that would
ensure its sustainability. and it's been
doing some of that, but continually do
that.
Imagine if it if it just kept the cash
and all of a sudden a business that it
always wanted to buy suffered a bad
quarter and it bought it. It's very
difficult when you have a lot of cash.
Cash is king. Cash is power. You know,
we've been talking and again it goes to
one of my rules about being negative
sounds smart. when if the market falls
uh or or suffers some kind of setback,
you shouldn't be concerned. You
shouldn't be you shouldn't be scared. In
fact, I I did a trip to China uh
life-changing practically earlier this
year. I'd never been before. And um when
I went to China, I if you go and in the
and I um met with analysts there and
taught them our our training process.
And if you when they when they look at
their screen, stocks that are down are
green, stocks that are up are red.
That's how you should rejig
screen. In fact, I called fact set in
and Bloomberg and see if we can change
that. Because if you look wake up every
day and everything's red and you like we
lived this in '08, right? It went lower
and you thought, "Okay, I'll buy some
now." And then it went lower two early
2000 and then it went lower until you
don't know what that feels like until
you go through it. But imagine if every
day it was green. You go, "Oh, this is
interesting."
And if every day it was going up, it was
red. You'd go, "Hm, I'm not sure. Is
this okay? Is everything okay? It might
be, but it's just everything's a
mindset, right? They talk about, you
know, the uh habits, right? Developing
habits and that and of course that
famous book. I I I love that. And you
know, you you want to do small things,
right? Develop put your shoes over there
so you remember to put them on there and
then put beside the shoes something that
you need to shine the shoes right there.
That way you shine them before you
leave. Why do you think so few people
like everybody talks like Buffett and
then a situation like 2008 comes along
and people were paralyzed.
>> He had cash but he wasn't paralyzed. Why
could he act and other people to me it's
it's uh it's it's goes back to something
we've already touched on and that is the
natural agency issues related with money
management industry. my investors give
me their money so I can make a return
that is hopefully better then they could
make investing passively if it doesn't
end up being that they decide to take it
away from me
>> and then I don't have any money Buffett
has built a business that generates cash
so he has operating businesses Gecko
Pulum etc these generate cash he takes
that cash and invests it when he wants
to invest it in the way that he wants to
invest it. You know, the average
portfolio manager can't do that because
they're tied to they have to like today
in the investment management industry,
portfolio managers are measured like on
a daily basis there. If you're investing
in my funds, you can look right now and
see how we're doing versus the index
every second.
>> Yeah.
>> Why are you down today? My, you know, my
partner that started the business with
me says, "I don't know because there was
more sellers than buyers today." Yeah,
>> I don't know any number and and someone
that tells you they can phys know
exactly why unless there was some
announcement and even when there was an
announcement, it was the interpretation
of the announcement that led to the
stock price falling, not the
announcement itself.
>> One of the things that we've sort of hit
on here without naming it is how
important structure is to investing.
Part of the reason that Berkshire was
able to do that and Buffett was able to
act is that or Buffett's able to do what
he's doing today is he controls so much
of the shares. So he's got the structure
to enable the strategy to play out.
Whereas if you think about it, you know,
there's many times during Brook
Birkshshire's
uh long career where an investor, an
activist investor would have come in,
demanded they return capital, demanded
they take on debt to buy back shares,
and the structure that's enabled so much
success has also prevented that. I I
think about structure a lot in terms of
not only being positioned so having cash
and you know being the master of your
own fate or what did Buffett say? I
never want to rely on the kindness of
strangers.
>> Yes.
>> Uh especially when I need them.
>> Yes.
>> And so like I think about that and I
think positioning. Anybody looks like a
genius when they're in a good position
and even a smart person looks like an
idiot when they're in a bad position.
>> Y
>> and then you think about structure and
how that aligns with the companies and
what you're trying to do. And you know
like it's similar to how I invest. I
don't have a fund. I don't have outside
investors. Why? Cuz I don't like that
structure. I don't want to answer to
other people. I don't want to. And if I
want to save up money for 3 years and do
nothing, then I can do that. And if I
want to chuck 80% of it into one
investment, I can do that.
>> Yes.
>> So the structure enables my style of how
I proceed with investing. And I think
that those are very underrated when we
think of public companies because you
have a time a structure mismatch. said
that's the first thing you look at is
the structure and the control
environment.
>> Yeah. And so you have shareholders who
have increasingly, you know, has gone
from years to probably
>> quarter seconds, whatever you want to
call it now. Uh the average CEO tenure
is is very short.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh and I I sort of like maybe the
analogy is bad, but I think about this
in the context of sports, right? Like if
I'm a head coach, I'm going into an 0
and17 team in the NFL. I'm going to take
risks and I'm going to do things that
may or may not work out. Uh but it's not
going to be status quo and I could leave
the situation worse than I found it. Uh
but what I'm not going to do is just try
to make it incrementally better.
>> I I I think your analogy is fantastic
and it's and it's why, you know, I I I I
played hockey and football in in in my
life and uh I I love hockey. uh you know
big huge league fan and watch uh watch
the games and so on but I watch more
NFL. I will watch teams that I have zero
interest in watching. Um and not because
of the not because the betting but
because any it's one game they only play
seven games. There is one semiinal game
>> and if they lose they're done.
>> Yeah.
>> And their career could be over because
the NFL career is so short.
>> Yeah. And and so whereas in hockey you
got seven games
>> like, "Okay guys, you know, second
period, we're down five. Okay, it's game
two. We're good. Okay, like we got this.
Settle down. Let's get ready. We play in
a couple of days."
>> So what I see happening in these
situations is like the new coach going
in to the bad team will overspend on
free agents.
>> Yep.
>> Uh they will leverage the future. Y
>> put themselves in a bad position salary
capwise in five years. Yep.
>> And it's almost under the assumption
that I'm probably not going to be the
coach in five years. Y
>> but this will make us immediately
better. I can show tangible progress and
I have a hope of but I've screwed myself
from year five to
>> 100%
>> you know forward. We talked about the
impact of passive investing.
I would say that passive investing has
always been there. Okay. Mhm.
>> What I think the more meaningful
important impact on investing today is
the power of the retail. I watched that
movie called Stupid Money was it called?
>> Uh with Hello Kitty and
>> Oh yeah. Yeah. That was great.
>> Um that is, you know, these are movies.
They're fantastic.
>> Yeah.
>> Because and the I love the word
fantastic. We haven't yet said it yet,
but because it's something supernatural.
It's something that is both good and bad
and it changed something. And so what
that really exposed is the power of the
retail investor.
>> Yeah.
>> And today the retail investor as a
component of total investment is the
largest it's ever been. And the other
thing that's interesting is that the
prevalence of all and how easy it is for
the retail investor to have just the
same information and maybe even better,
I don't know, but to have access to both
technical technical looking at charts,
fundamental looking at actual financial
information, social media stuff, access
to that in any way that I could get.
>> Yeah. at very low cost. So when I
started in the industry in 1999, okay,
and this think of Buffett, he'll tell
you the story of he used to read the
financial statements and he used to get
the chart the old charts and look at
them and no one was doing that.
>> Yeah,
>> they weren't paying attention even even
investor in in institutional investors
and the retail investor was hardly
paying attention. We were just learning
on dialup.
>> Oh, I agree. And you could trade, but
you you'd have to call in your trade,
right, and wait in line for someone or
and then it started online, but it was
really slow and you didn't get good
information and you didn't get great
fills. Now you have interactive brokers.
That platform that you get is
unbelievable. And all the other all the
other com comparatives that are coming
up that's empowering that retail
investor. So this is creating a
significant short-term
focus. There are day options, okay,
traded all the time. Someone told me
that in Tesla there's more transactions
on options than there are in dollar
value on the actual stock in
>> Oh, interesting. The option market is we
could do a whole discussion
on all the subtleties of the stock
market that people don't know. When an
option is sold, someone has to sell it
to them. Well, that's typically the
broker, the market maker sells that
option. They try to sell it off to
somebody else, but if they can't get the
other side, well, then then they stuck
holding it. Now, most options expire
worthless until they don't. If something
actually happens and the price rises on
the stock and you've bought calls, now
the broker needs to sell like needs to
act to make that money to pay you for
that option. And typically, they're
going to start acting on the stock
itself to hedge themselves.
>> They'll buy the stock because if your
calls are going up and the stock because
the stock's going up, well, I want to
buy the stock so that I'm hedged as the
calls go up. I'm also hedged with the
stock price moving. Well, that just
creates more momentum for the stock
price to go higher. And so that is that
I think is also causing big swings. Like
you know, we're looking at on a daily
basis during earnings season stocks move
like it used to be 1 or 2%. Now we're
looking at 20% moves in a day. Oracle
moved 20%. that was like on I don't
recall the exact number but that move
that those were valuations of entire
companies.
>> It was almost 40%.
>> So you think about that and yet we're in
a period of AI.
>> Yeah.
>> We're in a period where there are drones
now for Oracle's business drones might
not help. But think about Lululemon
drones looking at at what's being sold,
what's being
where traffic is. you're you have access
and you can buy access to credit card
data. You can get you can talk to
suppliers. There's all these expert
networks that you can talk to like
individuals working in the industry or
used to work in the industry. They'll
give you all this inside but not inside
type information. And so yet all of that
is happening and Oracle stock price
moves 40%
on news and we have access to better and
supposedly better information than we've
ever had. How does that make any sense?
If we had better information, then you
know what? Stock prices on news would
hardly move. Everybody would already
have known.
>> It'd be fully priced in.
>> Correct. So there in lies the
interesting point where you know they
think that AI is going to beat us as
investors. I say bring it. It's all
good. Bring it.
>> It's just a tool. We're still human.
It's a tool. It doesn't have judgment.
>> It doesn't have the ability to, you
know, make decisions on past links that
unless it unless that link that it drew,
but you don't even know what link it
drew. Well, as of today, I guess the the
potential is that it it supersedes
individual and collective intelligence
and so it gets to a point where it's
able to do that. I guess that's the
maybe
>> Yeah, we'll see.
>> Yeah, that's a great place to end this.
We always uh end with the same question,
which is a life question for you and a
personal question, but what is success
for you? Success is achieving something
that uh I can share with those that I
love and care about, my family and my
friends and my and my employees and and
and my customers. I I think that's the
success whether it's in sport. It's
achieving something that I can share. Um
because if I can't share it, you know, I
I I learned a quote long ago that uh
happiness can only be shared
>> from uh my late pastor priest uh Paul
Kuzzac. we'll give him a shout out. He
was awesome. And so if you can achieve
something and share it uh then it then
it's real success. And I think uh
winning has to be something that that is
everything. It has to it has to you have
to be focused on on achieving something
then nothing else can get in the way.
Big shout out to that book winning. Uh
I'm sure you looked at that book from uh
Tim Tim Grover. Uh that that's that's
such a pivotal study. This is a great
way to end this conversation. Thank you
so much, Anthony, for taking the time
today.
>> It's my pleasure, Shane.
