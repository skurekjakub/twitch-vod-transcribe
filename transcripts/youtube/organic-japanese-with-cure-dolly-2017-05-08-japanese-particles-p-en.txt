 
Hello, pretty peoples. KawaJapa no Kyua
Dorii desu. I am Cure Dolly from
KawaJapa. Today I am going to introduce you
to a Japanese character that you have
never seen before and you may never see
again. That is because this character is
usually invisible. Now, I have not
forgotten our subject. We were talking,
weren't we, about how the ga-particle
is the center, the fulcrum, the vital point
of every Japanese sentence, even when
there appears to be no ga in the
sentence. In order to explain that rather
mysterious-sounding fact, I have to
introduce you to this character, this
invisible character. Here it is. This is
the symbol for the Japanese zero pronoun.
Actually, I thought I had invented the
use of this symbol in my book "Unlocking
Japanese", but later, researching
subject further, I found that some
academic researchers also use this same
symbol for the zero pronoun. You probably
have not heard about the zero pronoun
because it is not taught in ordinary
textbooks and schools, but if you google
"Japanese zero pronoun", you will find a
lot of material about it, all of it
tucked away in academic papers and PhD
theses. This is very unfortunate, because
you really need to know this in order to
understand Japanese. It
can indeed become very complicated, but
the fundamental fact of the zero
pronoun is not complicated at all and
I'm going to explain it now. Let us begin
with an English sentence. Listen to this:
"Mary got out of Mary's car, went into
Mary's house and proceeded up the stairs;
when Mary got to Mary's room, Mary opened
the door and saw that Mary's things were
scattered all over the floor."
Is that a grammatical English sentence?
Yes, it is. Is it a natural English
sentence? No, it is not, because after we
have established who Mary is and we use
her name the first time, after that we
keep saying "she" and "her". We don't keep
saying "Mary", do we?
It's the same with objects as well as
people. Take this sentence: "Pick up the
barbell from the floor and hold the barbell
in your hand as long as you can; when the
barbell becomes too heavy,
replace the barbell on the floor." Now, that
is a grammatical English sentence, but
in normal, natural English we only say
"barbell" once to establish what the
subject is. After that we say "it". In
Japanese
we don't say either. In Japanese we use
the zero pronoun which you can't see and you
can't hear. Some people think the zero
pronoun is ambiguous, but actually it is
no more ambiguous than the English "it". "It"
can mean the Andromeda galaxy or a grain
of sand or a flower or the sky or your
ear. It can mean just about anything. "It"
only means anything in relation to its
context.
And the same is true of the zero pronoun. We can
only understand it in relation to its
context. So you can see that "it" is just
as ambiguous as the zero pronoun. It just
wastes more ink, because why do we need
to keep saying "it'" and "she" and "her" over
and over again? We don't. In Japanese, we
don't do that. We use the zero pronoun. So,
why am I even talking about a zero
pronoun? Does it matter whether we call it
a zero pronoun or whether we call it
just nothing? Yes, it does matter very
much. Unless we understand that the zero
pronoun is always there, we will find
it very hard to grasp Japanese. In order
to understand why this is, we need to
remember a couple of things about
particles and nouns and pronouns. The
basic one-character particles – ga, wo and ni –
all go at the end of nouns and we need
to think of them as inseparably attached
to their nouns. The noun and the
particle make up a single unit, and that
tells us exactly where the noun stands in
the sentence: what its relation is to
the other parts of the sentence. And we
must also remember that every noun and
every pronoun has a particle. In casual
speech, some of the particles may be
dropped some of the time. In formal
speech, there are a few cases in which a
particle can be dropped. But every noun
and every pronoun logically has a
particle. Now, here is the important thing:
this applies to the zero pronoun just as
much as to any other pronoun. The zero
pronoun
always has a particle, but because the
zero pronoun is invisible, its particle
is also invisible. That is why
sentences that do not appear to have a
ga in them in fact always do have a ga
in them. Every time we see a sentence with
no ga, we can be sure that the zero
pronoun is somewhere in that sentence and
has the ga. Now, to see how this works,
let's take an example of a very simple
English sentence: "Got milk?"
You can see that this English sentence is
using a zero pronoun. The zero pronoun here
is "you". "Got milk?" means "Have you got milk?"
If we say the same thing in
Japanese, "miruku wo motte imasu ka" we also
have the zero pronoun, and the zero pronoun
in this case stands for "anata" – you.
The difference is that "Got milk?" in
English is not correct grammar. You know
what it means, but it's not correct
grammar. "Miruku wo motte imasu ka" is
correct grammar in Japanese. It's using
the zero pronoun, which is a
legitimate part of Japanese, and the zero
pronoun, the invisible pronoun, as always
has an invisible particle attached to it.
And the particle here is ga. It
doesn't have to be ga. In some
sentences the zero pronoun may have a
different particle attached to it. For
example, if you say "dare ga keeki wo tabeta?"
– "who ate the cake?" – and I
reply "watashi ga tabeta",  what I am
saying is "I ate it". "It" in Japanese is the
zero pronoun, and so what I'm saying is
"watashi ga keeki wo tabeta".
So you see here the "it",
the zero pronoun, takes the wo-particle, not
the ga-particle. These sentences are
really quite simple,
but in more complex sentences we need to
be aware of what the zero pronoun is
representing and what particle it takes –
in other words, what role it plays in the
sentence. It can become more complicated,
especially where wa is involved. I said
last time that I will be talking about
wa this time and then I realized that
I have to explain all this before we can
get on to the question of wa. I will
try to do the next lesson a little
earlier so that you don't have to wait a
whole week before we get to wa. Taking
this all step-by-step, I think it is quite
easy to understand, but if there's
anything you didn't understand, please
ask me in the comments below. If you want
to add anything or if you want to raise
questions about what I'm saying, please
ask me in the comments below.
I don't mind if you criticize me. I will
reply to whatever you say. If you wish to
understand this all much more clearly, may
I take the liberty of recommending my
book "Unlocking Japanese". It's available
at Amazon in both paperback and
Kindle editions. Thank you so much for
attending this lesson. Kore kara yoroshiku
onegai shimasu. Class dismissed.
