yes sorry didn't realize they're streaming um yeah i'm looking at agios this morning agios

down around 50 looks like a buy to me agios is weird because like the delta and what the

company's worth is not that high they have they were trading at cash they have one drug but

selling a little bit but that's really the story of the company in a lot of ways is just like it's

very easy to calculate what what it's worth well nvidia reports later oh agios might be a

agios might be a big one okay i am q down i like that okay btq such a joke so so agios could be

i can see this rally so they're selling this for that weird disease

pyruvate kinase deficiency i think they have an snda for thalassemia beta thalassemia is not a

thalassemia it's not a thalassemia it's not a thalassemia it's not a thalassemia it's not a

terrible market the sickle cell is dead but sickle cell is just one hey sorry i'm not paying

attention to you guys i'm getting shellacked yeah eventually there's no greater fool sometimes you

are the greater fool it's me got paid by hedges we got paid by the hedges it's true that's how

they operate those hedges are vicious no i'm shorting olma

i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm

shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm

shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm shorting olma i'm

At least agios is ripping almost 25 now. I like that. My next move is crucial. What do I do?

How do I keep it real with shorty in the crew?

Excellent question. Where are my DMX?

DMX fans cold in this office

Guys want to see rage?

Wanna see rage?

No chance

capper hits

No chance

in hell

It's my best Triple H imitation

What trade? Every trade

Sorry, just chatting with my colleagues

Stop the cap capper. Wow, Sarepta's getting smacked. I'm trading Ulma around but no I didn't cover it

Last night I covered some when it when it crapped out on the offering

This is a predictable move too. I should have covered more or went long or something, but

That is life

life in the fast lane

Life in the fast lane. I don't know Andres. I don't know if they want that cap on cap off

the capper

So we want to look at oh shoot I have to go to this meeting we have to do the preview

This is the preview. Oh

It's at 1. Okay. Okay. I have time

1 p.m. Yeah, I added like 10,000 Ulma at the like 22

20 ish, so

Cover some of that make some of my money back there

But it does look like it's gonna fade

I'm more concerned with quantum man. I mean

Israeli's insane

Very good short. Oh, she's got a short. Oh my again up there. It's crazy

Fighting this thing hate fighting. Why can't we get along?

cooperate

Or the dock will have to operate

Alright, let's look at a video. Hey

We're who we thought they were

You let him off the hook were you kidding me?

playoffs

Yeah

All right

53

4 3

Was consensus last quarter. Let's see. We're

right now

54 9

much higher

These it started out just a few months ago

consensus was

Was 51 7 5 went up to 53 4 and now sits around 55

Guidance was 54

So streets well above guidance now

next quarter

Can't make this up 62

Street was at 57 a little while back now at 62 billion

so massive massive massive

increase in

They're actually expecting acceleration. Is that right?

right

I

these expectations or something I

see

We can look at core. We use cap ex to see if we can

divine something here

core weave spent

two three eight nine in q3

We know where that money went to went to Nvidia. It's actually less than I had projected

Let's look at meta

Again, all the hyperscalers told you

They're spending more than they thought they would

it's exactly medicaid man almost exactly what we projected 2 billion more 18829 and they said

okay that's did i get this right hold on hold on uh yeah these these quarters are a little staggered

so 2829 i already have that now we'll look at uh open ai in here not really sure how much they

spent but i know they raised a lot of money so we'll leave it at that maybe anthropic's spending

more now too you know they they cut a deal with microsoft and nvidia yesterday see if i can

check out oracle oracle's reporting what in december it's capex for oracle did tick down

well this will be interesting okay inq down qubt down like to see that being a mega bear doesn't

pay

right now but i'm about to go from ashy to classy yeah that's more like it i think nvidia is going

to blow out the earnings again i just don't know that it matters stock market's in this weird place

where the market understands that nvidia is going to beat the earnings the market understands that

the hyperscalers and the large the mag 7 basically are buying huge amounts of chips

but what the market wants to see is end user demand

the market can't see that yet i know it's there but the market can't see that yet and that's kind

of the the problem the market saw tons of end user demand or tons of spending or tons of buying i

guess they they'd change their tune but the problem is that you know there isn't an obvious way to see

that now they see it through azure but they're the market would like to see it from other places too

it doesn't trust azure necessarily so

it doesn't trust azure necessarily so

or gcpr aws so a lot of the places with the demand are private or opaque where

it's not so obvious you know and the corporate demand isn't really going to drive revenue it's

maybe drive cost savings so ai is kind of a predicament you know i mean it'd be a lot easier

if open ai was public then the market could kind of see the big boom or anthropic but you only have

palantir

and if you had open ai and anthropic they have more revenue than palantir they'd be the darlings

i like srepta it's one of these stocks that's like permanently in the doghouse and you know

you just gotta wait and wait and wait and at some point it'll be in good shape again

yeah they they look better than palantir's more pure play ai too i'm i like uh i like open

ai quite a lot no i think the srepta dcf is much higher than that i think srepta can get to 50.

it's just so punished and so you gotta understand the hate hatred for this company

it's so deep i i fully expect it to take you know several more quarters a couple more quarters and

you know we could at least you know see the earnings and the you know revenue and all that

are real uther is a very well-run company but i i don't see how they last with remodulin

so long it kind of looked like a short to me but i also would have told you to short you through

5x ago so they've they've they've been a really good at executing i don't know vanji i don't know

can you give me an example of a company you want more data for and i will get it done yeah

sorta jb flowland is really old though we have swiss stocks jonas which which one we have roche

we have uh all those things and delayed prices coming soon which one's ebs ebs uh so many well

who's ebs oh the swiss electronic boris which stock though i know the vertex v-i-r-t-x and i know

the swiss exchange the six s-i-x oh roche we have roche pretty crazy rog space se we're rolling out

the intraday pricing shortly yeah roche

had a big gap up yesterday on that news gemini 3.0 or 3.5 i think it's 3.0 isn't it i do not ski

i haven't gotten an update on eqs hopefully it is moving along i'll get that tomorrow

it's freezing here don't know lx what kind of company is that hey yo big z can you get me a

sweater really i don't know that's five hour energy

yeah if you need help just text chris show him the no i don't trust your fashion sense no offense

i'm just kidding i do i do balenciaga no no balenciaga he's gonna overrun the card

i want balenciaga no no no this stream is sponsored by five hour energy

take one of these good for the rest of the day how many five hour energies over under 1.5

all right let's see uh you want abb which stuff do you look at alan aln yeah all real this is all

real holding ag aj swiss real estate three billion swiss francs market cap okay some updates on godel

here let's see try to hard refresh if you're on there there's a update in progress qm is batch

import oh that sounds fun omon rearrangeable columns have been updated and i'm not sure if

you're on there yet but i'm not sure if you're on there yet but i'm not sure if you're on there yet

uh des shows the correct market cap for some privates uh and multiple share classes finally

ds can now toggle to intraday that's pretty neat wojak i who made this wojak this is so

this is so wojak is so dumb whoever made this who put this in the code base i want to get blame

right now who put this trash in the code base this wji i need

i need to get blame what is this the best feature somebody writes

if this is voted best feature 2025 i'm i'm dead

mojack the only feature worth the price i pay because of wojak what the

wojak bussen i think that's a typo is it live will it respond to live wojak

can somebody do a wojak let me see if it resp oh yeah it's responding

how do i do a wojak i don't even know how do i do a wojak i don't even know

oh it's this how come my watch oh oh oh

he went to the bear side okay 58.8 pink when is the wojak going to start crying

where are the tears oh there we go

it's so stupid eight bazillion jillion dollars oh i'm gonna go to the saudi forum um tbpn saudi forum

korean wojak oh wojak has to be internationalized please especially korean ip addresses should see

it in korean so my estimate is that actually that that the cost of of electricity like the cost

effectiveness of ai in space will be overwhelmingly better than ai on the ground so far long before you

uh exhaust potential energy sources on on earth

long before meaning like i think even perhaps in the four or five year time frame the lowest cost

way to do ai compute will be with solar powered ai satellites so i'd say not more than five years

from now and just look at the super computers we're building together let's say each one of

the racks is two tons out of that two tons 1.95 of it is probably for cooling right just imagine how tiny that little thing is

supercomputers right each one of these GB 300 racks and just be a little tiny

thing and just electricity generation is already becoming a challenge so if you

start doing any kind of scaling for both electricity generation and cooling you

realize okay space is incredibly compelling so like let's say you wanted

to do I know two or three hundred gigawatts per year of AI compute yeah

it's very difficult to do that on earth the so the US average electricity usage

last time I checked was around 460 gigawatts per year average usage so so

something like say you know three three hundred if you're doing 300 gigawatts a

year that would be like two-thirds of US electricity production per

year there's no way you're building power plants at that level and then if

you take it up to say a terawatt per year impossible yeah like you have to do

that in space there just is there just is no way to do a terawatt per year on

earth and in space you've got continuous solar you've got you don't you actually

don't need batteries because it's always sunny in space and

and the solar panels actually become cheaper because you don't need glass or

framing and the cooling is just radiative so that's that's why I think

that's the dream yes that's the dream so Jensen everybody last night was asking me

and I'm mindful it's earnings call for you today I'm gonna say this delicately

everybody has been asking me to ask you are we gonna have an AI bubble that's the

last question

all right let me well let me just tell you what we see okay so so I think it's

really important when you look at what's happening around the world and go back

to first principles of what's happening in computer science and computing there

are three things that's happening the first thing is that we all know that

Moore's Law has run its course and the ability that the amount of demand for

computing versus the amount of computation we can get out of general

purpose computing is really challenging and so the world's been moving to

accelerated computing for some time we've been pushing this now for some

over 20 years

let me give you one statistic I was just at supercomputing six years ago CPUs

were 90% of the world supercomputers top 500 supercomputers six years ago this

year less than 15% went from 90% to 10% and meanwhile accelerated computing went

from the other way 10% to now 90% okay so you're seeing that inflection point

the transition in high-performance computing from general purpose of

computing to accelerated computing and that's what we're going to talk about today.

Well one of the most data intensive one of the most intensive computation things that the world does in cloud is data processing several hundred billion dollars of computation is done on just what the fuck well batch import sounds pretty good for QM see how do I do that QM and what do I bet how do I batch import doesn't say uh-uh there it is at the bottom.

because it's a $2 stock is always the most traded but then Opendoor, Nokia,

OnDAS are all up there. NVIDIA is only sort of big one. Okay I have less and

less hair. All Cloudflare's fault. All my homies hate Cloudflare. Public apology

tweet. I'd like to apologize on behalf of Cloudflare. I don't really know Drux

pharma guys. I don't talk to them too much so that's his pharma guys are

picking those stocks. I don't know what it is a value guy. You got to tell me

what kind of company it is. You guys want to see me repair in my head? You guys

think I'm handsome? Oh what the fucking trade just went off. Something popped off.

What kind of fintech company? What's a fintech company? What that

mean? Okay CINQ melting down a little bit. That's what I need. I feel a market

turn coming. I'll manifest it.

The market meltdown. I love it.

Some D wave. D waves. Always a good short. What a dog. Shit bird company.

Where's this kid... Where'd this kid go? I just need a sweater. All I want here was

a sweater. This guy's going shopping. About Balenciaga... Who asked you to get

Balenciaga? You saw it on the chat? On a stream? So you've got Balenciaga because

you read it on the stream? This man doesn't want a job anymore. Somebody's getting fired. Somebody's

gonna die tonight. So what do we do with Sarepta? Usually when this happens, there's some news in

the DMD community that we don't know about. You are baggy. You're a baggy. I'm a baggy. You're a

baggy. We're all bagged up. That's why you don't, I don't love buying Sarepta in the middle of the

day. Cause it's like, who the fuck knows what's around the corner tomorrow. But I could buy a

little bit. Yes, I am. What's this Balenciaga? 700. What? Lululemon? Yeah. $700. Are you

smoking? You can return it. Whoop your ass. Whole stream is fucking, don't listen to the stream.

The stream is not your boss. The stream isn't telling you what kind of sweater to buy me, man.

Fuck. Bro, you crazy for this one. I wanted like a $40 sweater. I wanted like Fruit of the Loom.

Man bought me a whole Balenciaga. 700. You guys see this shit? Look at this shit. This guy's

retarded. No, this isn't even, this isn't even fake. Look at this shit. Okay. Well, that doesn't

help. Fucking crazy, right?

What do you think of Kanye West or something? Trying to switch back to partial screen. It's over. Oh,

wait, wait. I know what I'm doing wrong. Fucking easy taught him. Easy taught you nothing.

He said, bros. One of the streamers read, bros just pulled. Not trying to kill anyone. Bro,

this is the nicest sweater I have. Man bought me the nicest sweater I own. What's up? You want

to touch it?

yeah i don't know man yeah got me a whole new wardrobe for that now i need it are you gonna

get a chain too apparently they want a chain now we're ready to cook we need to make the money back

from this fucking well this is fancy damn oh you guys don't see how fancy this shit is

it's got like a little it's like this is like a kamath joint it's like wraps around

it's like you see this this comes back it almost gives the appearance of a

you guys maybe can't see that this stitching is very rare what did kamath say got a little like

it rolls up around the around the top there shawl collar oh of course 827 knows this bullshit

oh man these fashionistas dude

is that

is that

is that

i maybe when i was his age i was a male fashionista maybe i started losing it after my 20s i just

became a a bill gates uh bill gates fucking uh warren buffett clothing guy bill gates real story

he told my friend he got some glasses for like 60 bucks and he was upset that they were expensive

he's like i get the discount glasses at this place but i had to go to this other place and

it was 100 bucks homie you were 200

billion

worried about a hundred dollar pair of glasses how much are we paying this guy that he thinks

seven i'm all ready to dump some spacks yeah why do they call it godel because you take the god L

yeah he did get me that cashmere from goby pro car take it out of his bonus that's a good idea

we'll go halves on it at least sweater have a red dot on it no

thinking somebody's trying to assassinate me

scrolls i think not i'm not yeah okay almost starting to drop a little bit that wasn't that

fast he went shopping okay almost looking like it's heading back down take it that was a weird

squeeze they tried to squeeze scrolls can't squeeze the squeeze come on man he's trying to

squeeze squeeze nah you're not doing that can't squeeze me you couldn't squeeze me if i was

catch up yeah i'm gonna short some d wave and capper capper is probably coming soon and almost

up 15 at one point shit is flat now who got caught in that who got caught in the not scrolls

not scrolls oh hell no i shorted more i think i got squeezed please please shit's about to turn

red you mistake me for man come on man i'm not that guy don't put my name in there

screlly got squeezed you never heard that screlly got margin call you've heard that

this is agios agios fell apart today on bad sickle cell data but they still have a company

they love a drug i mean no i would say the opposite crown jewel i don't see nvidia helping

helping quantum anytime soon but if nvidia shits the bed quantum would go down a lot

nvidia's in this really hard position where they're a victim of their own success i mean

they're a victim of their own success i mean they're a victim of their own success i mean

expectations riding on the shoulders of this company at some point those shoulders get tired

and it's heavy or i'm eating i'm not eating anything did sadalos have data positive functional

data oh i can't remember this was publicly traded never heard of this company i doubt it's down

because of that finra makes you pay or i think finra makes the finra member pay okay agios going

up a little more down i'll take it

oh i have abby shapiro sweater somewhere i'll bring that i'll bring that at some point burn

baby burn i mean what's there to say about sarapta that hasn't been said a hundred times

it's always shorted i'm shorted poor abby man abby's back she's taking photos again man

it's one lucky husband i'm much luckier of course but i'm very lucky okay i want for nothing

all i'm saying is classically abby

i'm sure the husband is five three trying to find let's see there's a she doesn't show it

show off anymore you have a lisp what what are the other qualifications bitcoin's nose diving

let's see 89.2 be right back gotta get out of here soon for a big time meeting

they got a big time meeting it's with some big time people

you are invited because you're not big time all right big time people only you're not invited

I'm gonna head out to this meeting guys. I'll be back in time before NVIDIA

So don't go anywhere. I see IonQ dropping. I love it. Burn baby burn. I need that at 40
