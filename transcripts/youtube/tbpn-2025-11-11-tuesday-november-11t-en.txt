UAV online.
>> UAV online. Good morning everyone.
>> You're watching TBPN.
>> Tuesday, November 11th, 2025. We are
live from the TVP Ultradum, the temple
of technology, the fortress of finance,
the capital of capital. Ramp.com. Time
is money. Save both. Easy. Use corporate
cards, bill pay, accounting, a whole lot
more all in one place.
>> That is right. Uh more importantly than
ramp. Today is Veterans Day.
>> It is.
>> It is a holiday.
>> Yes.
>> Uh it is an important holiday.
>> Yes.
>> And we would like to say thank you to
everyone that served.
>> Of course. Yes. Thank you to everyone
who served. uh missed missed uh missed
opportunity to get the secretary general
back on the show.
>> Yes. Yes. I'm sure there are.
>> But um
>> big events happening in DC and all over
the armed forces community. Um we we
inadvertently did some uh Defense Tech
day yesterday with Nuros and Anderl.
That was fun taking a little tour of
both of those companies. Uh, and defense
tech seems to be just cooking like just
on a on a steady state. Yeah. Yeah.
Steady state. And uh I don't know just
much less um much less froth, much less
uh you know calls for is this the top of
defense tech. It's more just like
>> it's possible we already passed the top
>> of defense tech.
>> Yeah. you know, well, well, I mean,
there had been some rounds maybe earlier
this year that felt a little bit frothy.
>> Oh, okay.
>> But like the near nearest round
yesterday
>> like feels like they're
>> probably the best or one of the best
teams and let's focus on this problem.
DJI can make tens of millions of drones
a year. We cannot. Somebody ideally
multiple companies will work on that
problem. And so it feels like it's just
a fair bet
>> in the context of our national security.
>> Totally. Yeah. Uh, and yeah, I mean we
certainly haven't seen there's just like
way fewer top signals in defense tech
right now. It feels like like there's no
like oh crazy spack going out that's
like frothy memes, you know, around this
stuff. Um, it's it's just a lot it's a I
mean it's still like a long way to
deliver all the value there and and
really scale those companies. But uh
overall I think uh like a lot of
support. Uh, you know, I was kind of
joking with Saurin like what's it like
working in like a non-controversial
industry? Um, and you were like doing a
double take. Um but it is like a less
controversial industry in my opinion
than AI right now in terms of
>> than chat bots
>> just in terms of like in tech AI is
controversial because of the uh the
adult content and the IP rights and all
and the leverage and the debt and all
that stuff. And then outside of tech,
you have energy prices and
politicization.
Is the AI woke or is it too right-wing
or leftwing? Uh is it going to be used
to manipulate the election? Like I think
if you actually went AC like just random
person on the street like you know poll
of uh of popularity like Palmer Lucky
who's for a long time been like a
contrarian, a controversial figure.
Yeah. Right. Uh it feels like he would
pull more popular than a Sam Alman or a
or an AI lab director, AI lab CEO, even
though he's like building weapons, like
the most controversial thing.
>> I think part of it is like how hard can
you crush a Joe Rogan appearance.
>> He did do well. Yeah. Yeah. So may maybe
that's it. Uh, but just in general, it
feels like the idea of like like the the
the
American populace is not frustrated
directly over weapons production right
now. A little bit, but not not not as
much as people as it used to be years
ago. The idea of like working with the
military is much much less of a of a
cornerstone issue, a hot debate uh than
it was six years ago, eight years ago.
Um, and the conversation has moved on to
job displacement, to energy production,
to, uh, you know, internet addiction,
that type of stuff. Um, anyway, uh, to
reream.io,
one live stream, 30 plus destinations,
multiream, reach your audience wherever
they are. Uh, I was noticing a pattern
that everyone has 10-year AGI timelines
right now. And it and it started we we
it started when Sam Alman put out that
post like super intelligence is just a
few thousand days away.
>> Yeah.
>> And at the time it was kind of odd
because
>> like when he wrote that post last year
everyone was like AGI is one year away.
AGI is two years away. It was like fast
takeoff time. Like everyone was very
excited. And then he came out and was
like it's a few thousand days away. And
if you do the numbers I think Tyler has
the the clock. How how long is a few
thousand days? 3,650
days. How many years is that? 10 years.
10.
>> It's a decade. Puts us squarely in 2035,
right? And so Sam came out and, you
know, and he he was kind of in his blog
post of the super intelligence age
talking about, you know, maybe we're a
decade away. Then Andre Carpathy goes on
Daresh just a couple months ago, a
couple weeks ago, says AGI is a decade
away. And then Dwar posts this um this
uh this probability density of of when
AGI will be achieved. There's a chance
that America does it. There's a chance
that China does it. And the median the
50 the 50th percentile was exactly 2035.
Exactly 2035. Could have been any could
have been 2030 could have been 20 40
could have been 2050 but it was 2035.
Then
>> and you know that that uh that chart
that like very uh skitso chart that says
periods when to make money. Have you
seen this floating around on X? And it's
like
>> it was created
>> like I guess about a hundred years ago.
People references it anytime it like
actually aligns to events because it's
basically has years in which panics have
occurred years of good times, high
prices and and time to sell stocks
>> uh and years of hard times, low prices,
and a good time to buy stocks. And so
it's basically like um astrology for
stock picking, right?
>> And and what is it saying right now?
2035 is a year is they're predicting is
when a panic will occur.
>> Ooh, interesting. Well, that certainly
aligns with all these AGI timelines.
There you go.
>> The other one that we mentioned on the
show yesterday was George Hotz, the
founder of KMA uh and generally regarded
as like one of the sharpest uh hackers,
computer scientists, uh AI developers.
uh he was looking at the Tesla FSD data
and projected that um if the rate of
improvement continues, you basically see
a doubling in capability every year, you
double it out, the if you're if the
benchmark is how many interventions
happen per thousand vehicle miles
traveled and you compare that to how
many crashes happen when a human's at
the wheel. Uh he says Tesla's about
eight years away. um which puts him like
squarely in the 2035 camp, 2033 I guess
in his case. Um and then I was looking
at Meter and this one we'll have to
debate a lot more, but Meter has been
tracking AI's ability to complete long
tasks. So they've so they've they've and
it's growing exponentially. It used to
be like 6 seconds, now it's like 2
hours. And you know when you talk to uh
anyone who's in the AI field they'll
tell you that the agents are getting
more and more capable of handling longer
longer time horizon tasks. Uh the
question is I feel like humans don't
have a time horizon. I feel like humans
they're just born and the goal is like
survive uh be fruitful multiply right.
Yeah. And so, uh, I feel like if you're
if you're tracking the meter data, you
need to get out to like 30 years, like a
full career, right? Like the prompt
needs to be like go make money and then
it just goes and becomes a lawyer and,
you know, lives its full life and
retires after after a 35 year run. And
of course when you track out the
doublings uh one in 2035 uh the me meter
is projecting based on that log curve
that or that log that log graph that um
AI will be able to have a time horizon
in the in the decades and so you would
you would have it some something similar
to what a human would have and so uh my
my read on the meter data is that you
know AGI 2035 again it's kind maybe the
messiest, the the least like definitive.
Um, and all these predictions have
different methodologies. Some of them
are extremely qual quantitative. A lot
of them, some of them I'm like reading
really reading into. Some other people
are just saying like it's a decade away
specifically. Um, but what's interesting
is that it just feels like 10 years is
this consensus right now and there's
much less diversity of opinion. There
aren't that many people saying two years
anymore. There aren't that many people
saying 50 years anymore. Everyone's kind
of saying 10 years. And I just wonder
like let's put aside like let's try and
accurately predict when this thing
happens and let's just analyze it from a
psychological perspective and like what
does it mean when the tech community all
has a consensus of something that's a
decade. Like a decade away could just be
what people say when they don't know.
Like if you ask me when flying cars are
going to happen, I'm going to say a
decade. If you're going to say when
quantum computing, oh that'll be a
decade. Oh, uh, Mars. Yeah, that's a
decade. It's easy. It's like it's
optimistic. It's a way. When I say a
decade, I I'm I'm I'm not saying it's
not going to happen, but I'm saying like
you're not going to be able to hold me
to my bad take
>> because because you're not going to be
able to clip this in in one year and be
like, he was wrong. Right.
>> Yeah. It it is funny the quote, most
people under overestimate what they can
accomplish in one year and underestimate
what they do what they can do in 10
years. And in this situation, we're just
like, yeah, we're estimating that we can
just achieve AGI in 10 years, but a year
>> a year is actually so it's effectively
like inverted.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so, but the
other weird thing that I was grappling
with was like when I personally feel
like about AGI, like I'm convinced by
these like I feel like AGI is 10 years
away and I don't feel like I'm like
coping or doing some sort of like mental
logic jumps or something. It's just like
if you actually force me to put a
prediction down, I probably would say
about a decade. And I feel like I've
been around there, been on the Kershw
timelines. Maybe maybe I'm 2045, more
like Kerszswall, but still like a
decade, two decades, like I feel like
it's real. I I feel like I do believe
it's going to happen. I don't I don't
feel like I'm I'm like AGI never. I'm
not in that camp. And so then I go to
well well like how should I actually be
changing my behavior? Like if something
big is coming in a decade, it feels like
you should actually should not just be
acting normally. Um, but it it feels
like there's some sort of preference
falsification going on. Like how many
everyone's saying a decade. How many
people are actually acting like it's a
decade? Like what should you be doing in
the intervening years if it's a decade
away? Like are you just supposed to like
build technologies that are fun little
dopamine rewards? Are you trying to like
accumulate as much capital as possible
before
>> I think Well, yeah. So, so when I mean
who plans around 10 years at all, right?
People tend to go for things that they
want today. Yeah,
>> in some ways, right? So, somebody like
let's say they're in their 20s, they're
like, I want to own a home
>> by the time by 2035.
>> They want that thing today. And so they
they but they might understand, okay,
it's going to take some time to get
there.
>> Yeah.
>> But actually
making real changes in your life for
this like impending scenario that's hard
to predict entirely.
>> It's very very difficult. And I don't
know that I don't know that any you know
it was maybe more popular
earlier this year to joke about you know
uh
uh what you know the golden retriever
maxing right we we would talk about this
right
>> um but it feels like that dialogue has
kind of
>> changed.
>> Mhm.
>> How so?
>> Part of it goes back to the the other
like enduring meme. you know, you have
one year to escape the permanent
underclass. And then everyone woke up
and like a few months ago and said,
"Okay, maybe we actually have like
longer dec
uh escape, whatever that means, whatever
their whatever their number is."
>> Yeah, it's a it's an odd time. I'm going
to tell you about Privy and then we'll
get Tyler's reaction. Wallet
infrastructure for every bank. Privy
makes it easy to build on crypto rail.
Securely spin up white label wallets,
sign transactions, integrate onchain
infrastructure, all through one simple
API. Uh Tyler, what what do you think
about my take? What do you think's uh
what do you agree with? What do you
disagree with?
>> Um yeah, I I think it's definitely
interesting that people seem to kind of
align around this tenure thing. I think
there's also some sort of bias, right?
If you think AI is coming in three
years,
>> um you're probably not just going to be
like writing blogs like you're maybe
you're going to start a macro hedge
fund, maybe you're going to go work at
one of the labs to like really try to
influence how it's going to happen if
it's going to happen super quick. Yeah.
>> So I think there's some sense of that.
Um, and if you really don't believe AGI
is coming at all, then like you're also
probably not going to be writing blogs
about AGI. You're just going to be like,
yeah,
>> doing your normal job or whatever.
>> So, I think there's some like
confirmation bias there.
>> 10 years, exactly the time of a venture
capital fund life cycle. Coincidence?
>> Tyler's probably the most agi pelled
person on the team. And so, it's
interesting that you're you kind of
>> I think day-to-day act like everyone
else on the team. Yeah. Yeah. What
question you've done? What's your
biggest revealed preference?
>> That's hard to say.
>> Maybe just hanging out on the show.
>> Yeah. Just hanging out podcasting
instead of going to university. He's
just like, "Yeah, nothing matters,
>> I guess. I mean, there's a little bit of
that."
>> Uh yeah. Yeah. Maybe May maybe AGI. And
it's just it's just hard because like in
in the intervening years there's clearly
like just incredibly like high leverage
work to be done. It's so easy to pull
forward like okay well like the the the
robots are going to be able to do X. So
maybe you shouldn't spend the next 10
years doing X. But if in fact X is very
valuable, then the next 10 years you can
capture a ton of value as you leverage
more and more technology right up until
the point where you don't need to do it
anymore because it's fully automated.
Yeah, I think there's some sense of like
at least for me it's like okay, maybe I
would be working at
>> maybe I would have started some rapper
company or something like that. Yeah.
>> But I'm more bullish on AI than I think
most people are
>> to where I I think that stuff is
generally not super kind of long-term
oriented.
>> Um so maybe
>> I think something some sort of that kind
of
>> Do you think do you think we'll be
podcasting in 2045?
Um, yes. But I I I say yes because I
think the podcast is to live.
>> I I agree. I think it might be around
way past AGI.
>> I mean, I don't I think I think
everybody everybody wants to believe
that. Like
>> I don't I don't know. I I have yet to
see.
>> I don't know that mining is going to be
around forever. I don't think people
mine for the love of the game. I don't
think people go in the coal mine and
mine and they would do it if they didn't
get paid. But I think people do play
chess.
>> Children yearn for the mine.
>> And I think people podcast for fun.
>> Children yearn for real life game of
Minecraft.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean Minecraft for sure.
Playing games for sure. That's actually
sort of where where my take but imagine
imagine uh you have an army of robots
and you just get to use a computer to
control them to mine for for minerals.
That that sounds like it could be pretty
fun and fulfilling.
>> Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. That sounds
like a That sounds like a loophole. I
was talking about actually like swinging
an axe in a in a in a mine shaft. Um
yes, maybe maybe there will one day be
an AI agent for mining. We've actually
talked to some folks who are doing AI
for mining. Uh if you're mining value in
your codebase, get on Cognition, the
makers of Devon, the AI software
engineer. Crush your backlog with your
personal AI engineering team. Um yeah.
Oh, where where I landed at the end of
this was talking about uh uh this clip
of Alex Wang that's sort of going viral.
People are dunking on it. Uh because he
recommends that kids learn to vibe code.
And uh and I just disagree with the
haters. Like I I think the haters are
wrong on this one. Um and I was thinking
about like well I have a kid like would
I teach him to vibe code? And I was
playing with Legos last night. and I was
assembling Legos and from what I've done
vibe coding uh and what I've done in
Legos, I'm like this is going to be very
fun and this is going to be an activity
that we do together and I'm super I I'm
like super in agreement that I think uh
learning to vibe code is good. What do
you think, Tyl? Um, I think like the
point of view of like the people hating
were that like, oh, your your
13-year-old should be like making B2B's
ass, which is like not not that's
different than saying they should be
vibe coding cuz vibe coding is just like
it's like basically playing a video game
or it's like making a Minecraft mod or
something. That's like seems totally
fine.
>> Yeah. Some of the criticism some of the
criticism was like you should just be
doing really hard things.
>> Okay.
>> But then
>> you have to ask is like okay, should
13-year-olds like only be handcoding?
Like if you want to get them into maybe
making doing engineering work, is it
should they be doing it with a pen and
like what what is the alternative or
should they just be just doing math
problems or studying
>> physics? I had some sort of uh I had
some sort of advanced Lego thing,
robotics thing that you could actually
write software for and kind of make it
drive in circles or you could program it
to drive in a figure eight. That was
really fun as a kid. When I was 13, I
was working on little iPhone apps.
>> Yeah.
>> And knowing the vibe coding tools that
are available today, I would have been
able to make way more progress. I would
have had a lot more fun.
>> Yeah.
>> It would have been like having an expert
>> like software engineer sitting next to
me kind of like pair programming, right?
>> And so
>> I just Yeah, I'm I'm on your side. I
think I think people generally just just
don't like Alex because he's been wildly
successful and uh uh people want to try
to
>> he's basically the youngest most
successful person in the world
>> which invites a lot of criticism.
>> Yeah. Um, and and also it it's it's
tough when uh when you build a business
that it's not like I think when Evan
Spiegel blew up with Snapchat, he was
very much loved because people were
like, I like Snapchat. I got a date on
Snapchat. I met my girlfriend on
Snapchat. I use it all the time
>> or I use it with my friends or my boys
or whatever or like my group in my group
chats on Snapchat. So, it's very easy to
be like, "Yeah, he's rich, but I like
the thing he made." Whereas with Alex
Wang, it's like, yeah, he's rich and I
have no idea what the thing he I don't
interact with it at all. And so it's a
lot harder. Um, but yeah, I don't know.
I I feel like I feel like a generic call
to action to young people to vibe code,
to be entrepreneurial is good. I mean, I
I I you know, discovered
entrepreneurship in some ways through
Tim Ferrris, who had a similar sort of
like the 4-hour work week was not some
like deep understanding of how business
and technology works. It was more just
like, hey, you could set up a business
and like it could be a really
interesting life. And it's very
different than like becoming a lawyer or
becoming a doctor. Like when you're just
like a blank slate kid, you're kind of
offered a menu of options which is like
do you want to become a fireman,
>> doctor,
>> policeman, like
>> construction worker,
>> construction worker and and
>> businessman
>> and Yeah. And you hear businessman but
you don't really know what that means.
>> Businessman
>> and it's very different to be like
>> accountant. A businessman is an
investment banker or a consultant if you
stay on the track and you're just like,
I only I always ask for permission,
right? I I always go into the next thing
and there's I always have a boss. Um,
entrepreneurship is this like sort of
vague thing that's like hidden and it's
nice when when it's served up.
>> Yeah. There's so many different flavors
of it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, I I enjoy I enjoy a
little serving of uh entrepreneurial
insight. What What do you think, Tyler?
>> Uh, fun fact. So, in fifth grade, um, in
the yearbook, they asked like what you
wanted to be. Yeah. I put investor.
>> Investor. In fifth grade.
>> Yeah.
>> I didn't even really know what that
meant.
>> How are you sure you didn't put capital
allocator?
>> You put in
>> That's what I meant. Yeah.
>> Uh, I mean, in in fifth grade, uh, they
had a uh it was like, uh, bring in a
mobile, create a mobile for someone that
you respect. And everyone in the class
brought in like a picture of their dad.
And I brought in a picture of Bill Gates
because I was like, I made the computer.
Like the computer's awesome. And
everyone was like, what are you like
doing, dude? Like, do stop deifying
business people. I was like, I will
never stop deifying business people.
It's great.
>> Ever since the fifth fifth grade, I knew
I wanted to get into asset management.
>> Love it. I love it. Well, speaking of
asset management, uh, Masa Yoshi Son is
back in the news. uh SoftBank's big
profits jump this quarter came from
OpenAI's increased valuation that Soft
Bank lifted higher by buying shares from
employees uh and selling them at a
higher price and so there is a question
about is this C too circular it's
unclear if uh SoftBank was really the
price setter on this deal but uh Dar
just Daario is certainly uh
>> just Dario is saying soft bank books a
capital gain on an investment it hasn't
paid for and recorded in its assets
yet.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh so uh I guess the narrative here is
>> gains on OpenAI shares by designating
vision fund 2 to underwrite the second
investment trunch at 500 billion value
that SoftBank Group cannot pay and
created a forward derivative contract
worth 8 billion all gadens out of out of
thin air. How is this legal? I don't
know. This doesn't seem that
>> there's a scenario where you would do
this if you were a company that invested
in a fund. Yes. And it's called maybe
some capital but not all of it yet. And
so you can show that there's a gain even
though you haven't paid actually paid in
the capital yet.
>> Yes.
>> Uh but I think the way in which SoftBank
is doing doesn't seem illegal but I
think it's non-traditional. Uh Sophie uh
over on X says SoftBank is selling its
Nvidia stake to fund companies whose
main expense is buying from Nvidia.
>> Okay. But don't VC firms run into this
all the time? And there's always a
question about like like how they mark
to market and if you're marking to
market uh an asset that you you invested
in twice. Um, and that's why a lot of
venture firms don't want to do like it's
it's it's a little bit iffy to lead
backtoback rounds, but because at a
certain point your LPs are going to
start having questions, but it does
happen and it's not the end of the world
and as long as you get other buyers um
like didn't Founders Fund do ramp
backtoback or something like that,
right? Yeah. But then there was like a
secondary transaction that came in
pretty quickly and then eventually
another firm came in and so once the
other firm comes in that mark gets a lot
stronger and then ramps actually like
mark themselves to market multiple
times.
>> This is I mean yeah this is
>> I don't know the the more important the
more important
>> god dude I tried to slide off the camera
the sneeze and the PTZ
>> the more important thing here is that
this is not the first time Masa has
exited Nvidia. He exited in 2019 before
the runup. Uh he was then Nvidia's
largest shareholder.
>> Uh and he had a 5% 5% stake in the
company that he sold for 3.6 billion and
it would now be worth over 200 billion.
Um so this this was ultimately um one of
the big
>> How much did he wind up investing
totally because he must have made money
overall. How much has soft
>> I don't know. I don't know exactly when
he actually bought back in
>> into Yeah, because if if this was all
from that initial slug,
I I feel like
this this five uh this five billion
could be on a basis of like 500 mil or
something. It's still relatively small
for the size of of SoftBank. Um but
while that's cooking, let me tell you
about Figma. Think bigger, build faster.
Figma's design and development teams
build great products together. Um,
let's see. Uh, SoftBank sells his entire
stake in Nvidia for 5.83 billion. Uh,
Quantian says, "No, they expect one of
us in the wreckage, brother. Have we
started the fire?" Uh, why? I don't
understand how this links to what's
happening here. Why? Who Who's in the
fire? Like, how is this how is this I I
don't understand this meme. Do you
understand this? I just like the line,
they expect one of us in the wreckage,
brother.
>> Yeah, it's funny because it's from the
Dark Knight Rises, right? But um but
like selling Nvidia, selling your stake
in Nvidia, like are people mad about
this because they think Nvidia is going
to rip further
>> or do
>> selling your stake in Nvidia?
>> Yeah. to buy to actually buy shares in a
company that you've already marked a
you're you're showing
>> a gain on in the last quarter.
>> Yeah.
>> So basically SoftBank is booking
profits.
>> Sure.
>> OpenAI profits. They are then selling
Nvidia shares to fund the original
investment of which they've already
booked the profits on. And the number
one driving force behind Nvidia's growth
is OpenAI.
>> Yeah.
>> Is that true?
>> I mean,
>> how big how big is OpenAI as a customer
of Nvidia? I mean, yeah, it's probably
the biggest, but I mean, the rest of the
hyperscalers still is still buying a ton
of Nvidia, right? Um I don't know.
>> I mean, yeah, I would say like
indirectly they're a big customer, but
like obviously they're not it's not like
they're funding the data centers.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. So, James
Thorne says, "Today we will get the Soft
Bank completely sold out of Nvidia. Fear
from bears on mainstream media and Wall
Street. Does anyone do objective
research anymore? Soft Bank initially
bought its Nvidia stake through the
vision fund in 2017, then exited
completely in January 19. They missed
it. They lost patience. Not the first
time." And so, uh, yeah, when did they
buy this latest slug? That's the
question. Um, SoftBank sold 32 million
shares of Nvidia in October. Also sold
part of its stake in T-Mobile for 9
billion. Uh, it's not the first time
they've cashed out of the chipmaker.
That's a funny way to put it. Uh,
despite the sale, Soft Bank remains tied
to Nvidia through its other ventures.
Yeah, that makes sense. Um, anyway, let
me tell you about Vanta. Automate
compliance, manage risk, improve trust
with AI. Uh, Vanta helps you get
compliant fast, and they don't stop
there. Our AI and automation powers
everything from evidence collection to
continuous monitoring and security
reviews and vendor risk. Warren Buffett
says he's going quiet. The world's most
famous investor warns against corporate
greed as he prepares to hand over the
reigns of Berkshire Hathaway. There are
a bunch of interesting post, but there's
also a story in the Financial Times. I
don't think it hit the I don't think it
hit the paper edition yet. Um, but we
can read the paper paper edition always
lagging.
>> It lags three to four days.
So Warren Buffett has told Berkshire
Hathaway shareholders that he is going
quiet, quote unquote, as the world's
most famous investor draws a line under
a career that has shaped corporate
American Wall Street over the past six
decades. As the British would say, I'm
going quiet, sort of, Buffett wrote in a
letter published Monday. The 95year-old
will step back from day-to-day
responsibilities at Bergkshire at the
end of this year when he retires from
his role as chief executive. Greg Ael,
of course, is coming in. Um, investors
have long seen Buffett, often called the
Oracle of Omaha as a corporate folk
hero, interspersing guidance on his
portfolio company's performance with
life and business advice, his frank
manager manner with shareholders. Both
his annual letters and his marathon
question and answer sessions during the
annual meetings in Omaha has been a
hallmark of his tenure. Buffett's letter
to shareholders on Monday took the same
tone with warnings about corporate greed
interlaced with calls for kindness. He
noted, for instance, that requirements
for executive compensation disclosures
backfired as business chiefs engaged in
a race to earn more than rivals. What
often bothers very wealthy CEOs, they
are human after all, is that other CEOs
are getting even richer, Buffett said.
Envy and greed walk hand in hand.
Interesting. Buffett added that
Berkshire should try to avoid future
CEOs who are looking to retire at 65 or
who want to become look at me rich or
initiate a dynasty. Look at me rich.
What an interesting uh turn of phrase.
>> Yeah, it's very notable that uh Buffett
has never been photographed doing a
money spread wearing Balenciaga, Rick
Owens.
>> Does he have any chrome hearts?
>> Uh probably no chrome. No chrome heart.
He's never been photographed
>> with chrome hearts.
>> Chrome hearts on.
>> Uh it is cool. He's going to continue to
do uh his uh thanks thanks a letter
every Thanksgiving. Love that.
>> I thought that was um Thanksgiving of
course uh one of the most underrated
holidays.
>> Yeah. So he he took the pledge to give
away um to give away his wealth. And so,
uh, it's going to be a pretty big
changing of the guard and and that's
going to have a pretty significant
>> the thing I'm looking uh forward to
seeing is is how many what the
attendance will be like in the
shareholder meeting next year like is
the is
>> the draw it or is it Yeah, exactly. I my
expectation is that they will retain a
huge amount of people because it's
people that have been going every single
year for a long time and it's just like
a kind of a meetup for people
>> uh that have probably you know that have
spent probably decades at least some of
them decades visiting and
>> uh being a part of it. Yeah. I also
wonder like to what degree can Greg Ael
like actually pick up the torch because
there's that interesting stat that like
if you go back 30 years ago when Buffett
was 65, he was I don't think he was
close to the richest man in the world.
He he compounded a ton in his third
30-year run. like from 65 to 95 he had a
particularly good run
>> that that made that took him from like
pretty rich to one of the richest people
in the world and so it would be very
interesting to see like Greg Ael what if
he really goes on a run for 30 years and
is just executing executing executing
it's very rare we just don't see that
many business executives or that many
like people broadly where that's like
the the highlight of the career is 65 to
95.
>> You think
>> it's exciting?
>> Do you uh do you think that that he can
be fearful when others are greedy?
They're kind of acting like it right
now, right? Half like I don't think it's
quite half a trillion. I think it's more
like under under 400 billion of cash,
but
>> uh they will be getting uh they will be
getting calls quite a lot of calls at
some point
>> for sure
>> and uh we'll see how they play it.
>> Yeah. Uh before we react to some of the
reactions on the timeline, let me tell
you about graphite.dev dev code review
for the age of AI. Graphite helps teams
on GitHub ship higher quality software
faster. Um, so Howard Angland is taking
shots at uh at Warren Buffett. So Warren
Buffett's talking about his final letter
and Howard says Buffett has commissioned
no plays, no poems, no symphonies, no
operas, no ballets, funded no paintings
or sculptures that will outlive him,
endowed no theaters, choirs, orchestras,
built no monuments, monasteries. Is this
true at all? I feel like he has to have
I feel like Warren Buffett has to have
given away enough money to endow at
least one theater. Like how do you not
just get hit up by your local theater in
Omaha once and say, "Sure, I'll send a
check." Like,
I would be shocked if he's never done
anything. And also, he's committed to
giving away half of his wealth. So, like
some of the money is going to wind up
with the opera, I imagine, just because
it's going to go out and get diffused
amongst all the different charity
efforts. It's not gonna all go into one
thing. Um, so, uh, Howard agrees with
him on this. He says he's right that
greatness does not come about through
accumulate great accumulating great
amounts amounts of money, which is what
he is known for. But beyond that, it's
fortune cookie level advice. It's not
wrong, but it that's about it. His
partner Charlie Munger's contribution to
architecture was to fund factory-like
college dorms in which a majority of the
apartments don't have windows. The Is
was that UCSB?
>> Where is that? Have you Have you been to
that dorm?
>> Yeah.
>> Did you live there?
>> Uh I'm trying to figure out which
>> we need to pull up a photo of the
Charlie Mer dorm. The Charlie Munger
dorm at uh at UCSB.
>> It's Mer Hall.
>> Munger dorm UCSB. It is a wild picture.
It's so funny. And it's like,
>> so they aband they they made the
donation.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> There's some reference to it on the
campus, but they abandoned the plans to
build a windowless dorm.
>> So sick. It's so Soviet.
It's extremely Soviet. I don't know why
they
>> um
>> I thought there were fake windows and
they were like TVs essentially, but they
would show like outdoor scenes. It
should be vertical TV windows that you
can just put Sora on and just watch AI.
>> He's like, you were complaining about
the cost of housing. I gave you housing
and now you're complaining it doesn't
have window.
>> Windows. Yeah. You give a massive cookie
with these people. It is so funny.
Apparently, it it it's also just so
funny. Like why are you so involved in
this project? like uh I thought he was a
bigger donator to Stanford first and
then also why like like I feel like if I
if I donate money somewhere I'm like uh
okay it's gone and you enjoy it and it's
it's on you like you're the one that
takes care of it to be in the weeds to
the level of like deciding where the
windows go is a wild move like I thought
you had other stuff to do I would just
be I feel like if I was in this position
I would just be too busy
>> does have other buildings on campus
Okay.
>> That window is among her residents um
that do have windows. So
>> I don't know. I mean also like is is it
safe to take the other side of this and
just say that like he was about to
create the greatest lock in of
>> I mean what if he was basically saying
like college students spend very little
time in their actual dorms
>> because they're out and about in the
world. They're studying. They're
library. They're at events. Totally.
>> They're really just using the dorm to
sleep. Why don't we create common areas
that have windows and outdoor area that
then you go in your pot?
>> Yeah,
>> just go in your pot.
>> Almost like a cave.
>> Yeah,
>> it's like a cave.
>> Cuz UCSB the the complaint from a
housing standpoint is that like nobody
has like nobody everyone shares a room
almost all the way through. Everyone
shares a room almost all four years.
>> Oh, interesting. So you never move off
campus?
>> Yeah. And it's like it's like one square
mile that people really live
>> and yeah, there's super limited housing.
And so I think Munger was coming at this
like probably like very pragmatically
and it's like hey you get you're giving
up Windows you're going to get your pod
>> but in exchange you get your own private
space.
>> Yeah.
>> People call it Dormzilla and they canled
it.
>> They call it Dormzilla. I forgot about
that. Do we find a picture of Dormzilla?
Do
>> I mean the the the the actual designs I
saw it for a second.
>> It's so funny. Uh, why can't we do a
real examination of the rules that state
every bedroom must have a window? This
is uh Eric Adams floated a similar idea
to Munger, calling for stripping
legislation that promises each citizen
each city citizen window access this
past March. Uh, you don't need you don't
need no window where you're sleeping. It
should be dark, he said. Well, that's
actually directly in the quote. That's
this is a direct quote.
>> That's from Mer. This No, this is from
Eric Adams, the New York New York man.
>> Okay. I was like, that sound that
doesn't that doesn't sound like that. It
>> is a crazy crazy.
>> I put a I put a picture of the floor
plan in the chat team if you guys can
pull this up. Um
>> they should have called it the Mer Bug
Den.
>> 14,000 the cave. The munger cave.
>> Um I don't know. It's pretty It's pretty
funny. It's also It's also just I mean m
maybe UCSB. When I think of UCSB, I
think of like, you know, it's this
beautiful like so just amazing like near
the beach, beautiful sunlight. Like you
definitely don't want to be in a cave.
It's like I I feel like I to I to I kind
of get the Soviet cave, the the Soviet
like the Soviet block era like you know
big buildings because it's like you
don't want to go
dormilla. Dormzilla. so good. I love it.
He was like, "This is what I need to
do." It's just like also just like,
"Can't you just give like a little bit
more money and get the windows?" Like
windows aren't that expensive, right?
It's such a wild such a wild thing.
Anyway, uh it's so so funny. So, um I
don't know. Uh Tyler, did you figure out
if Buffett has ever commissioned one
play, poem, symphony, opera, ballet,
painting, sculpture, theater, choir,
orchestra, monument, home, museum,
church, monastery, chanty.
>> So just at UCSB to give him credit, he
has the uh Charles Munger Physics
Residence. Okay.
>> Which is a beautiful, stunning building
>> with windows.
>> With many windows.
>> There we go.
>> And so yeah, he decided to window max on
this one.
Yeah, he's taking a bar rail strategy.
Some of the buildings have lost but
obviously that's Mer. That's Mer.
>> Yeah, this is Buffet. So, yeah. What
What did we learn about?
>> Yeah. So, I I think
>> um basically all of his donations he
does do a lot of donations, but they're
all they're basically he just gives
stock to people. So, he's never like
saying I want this museum to be built in
this way kind of thing. He just gives it
to a uh you know endowment or
institution or or some charity then they
like do what they Is that because he
wants them to like like kind of try to
10x it again?
>> Yeah, he wants bag holders. Um
>> Yeah, but like I don't think he has very
strong opinions on like should kids have
windows,
>> but can you find an example of of when
he gave stock to an organization because
if that organization went and
commissioned an opera, I'm putting this
in the truth zone. And I'm thinking that
I'm thinking that he did in fact. Uh oh,
the Munger Research Center in Pasadena
does have many windows. Credit where
it's due. Thank you, Taylor. You can't
commit to the Munger cave than you are
really committed to deliver.
>> He's given a lot to the um Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation.
>> Okay, that's sort of a circular thing.
It doesn't make any sense to me. Uh
anyway, let's move on from Warren
Buffett. Uh let me tell you about
Julius, the AI data analyst. Connect
your data, ask questions in plain
English, and get insights in seconds. No
coding required. Uh, we have a clip from
Scott Bessant on what is this? Newsweek.
>> ABC.
>> ABC Newsweek. So,
>> ABC this week.
>> ABC This Week. Okay. I'm learning. Uh,
the $2,000 dividend could come in lots
of forms. Let's play the clip.
>> You know, it could the the $2,000
dividend could come in lots of forms. in
lots of ways, George. Um, you know, it
could be just the the tax decreases that
we are seeing on the president's agenda.
You know, no tax on tips, no tax on
overtime, no tax on social security,
deductibility of auto loans. So, you
know, those are substantial deductions
that, you know, are being financed in
the tax bill.
>> Tyler, do you feel like this,
>> how is that going to help the day
trading community? Yeah, I was planning
on doing rampant speculation with this
$2,000. What am I going to do now?
>> You're actually you you're basically
fully You've already committed the
funds, right?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I've already placed a ton of
parlays.
>> Yes.
>> So, like, what am I supposed to do now?
>> I can't pay my parlay bill with a tax
decrease on auto loans.
>> Yeah. You're not looking for passive
income. You're looking for massive
income,
>> bro. I'm looking for massive income. I'm
looking for generative media on a
platform for developers. I'm looking for
fall, the world's best generative image,
video, and audio models all in one
place. Gener develop and fine-tune
models with serverless GPUs and on
demand clusters. Uh Doomer says they
should put a button on the IRS website
that allows you to either receive the
$200 STEMI check or if you press the
button, you have a 50/50 chance of
getting either $4,000 or zero.
I really think a lot of people would
press that button. Absolutely absolutely
wild. Uh certified bangers X now has an
account called atbangers and it is an
account that highlights the the best
bangers. They're testing something new.
Certified bangers. We want to recognize
the very best post that move the
timeline ranked by authentic
interactions. If your post is featured,
you will get a ser certified banger
badge on your profile for the month.
Here are the top five bangers for
October. Uh very cool concept. Um, very
similar to a project that uh, Jordy sort
of incubated uh, about 12 months ago,
almost a year ago,
>> January. It was during the fires. I
remember I remember they were ripping.
It was called Banger Archive and Jordy
would go and screenshot a post that uh,
had done very very well and resurface it
and the findings were shocking. Do you
want to break down what you learned from
that project? If you take any post that
had gotten like a minimum of 3,000 likes
and you just screenshotted it and then
posted the screenshot and said banger,
it would immediately get usually more
likes than the original post.
>> It was crazy.
>> There were there were some posts that
that had I screenshotted them. They had
like maybe 20,000 likes and then I
posted on there to get like 150,000
likes and like millions of views
>> and some of it is like there's there's a
timelessness and there's just like a
high it's just high quality content is
high quality content. There's certain
certain sentences that just are always
funny. They're just always funny. Some
of them get funnier. Uh some of them
some of them did fall off. Some of them
would flop even though they were a a
banger previously. Uh there were a bunch
of interesting findings from the uh from
the banger archive,
>> including at least one person that was
that got mad very mad. They were like,
"You could have just reposted it."
>> Exactly. And
>> the whole But the issue is it doesn't
work.
>> It doesn't archive it then because if
they delete it, then it doesn't stay.
But they want the they want the right to
delete. So, I understand where they're
coming from. Uh, bangers on bad.
>> Bobby in the chat says, "Don't care
about a Donald Boat says, "Don't care
about a badge. They should come to your
house and tattoo it on your body." Yeah,
having a badge for a month is
>> Yeah. I don't know. It's cool. I I I
think it's interesting because um
>> it's also I mean, so looking at the
posts that they they have here, they're
just kind of random.
>> Yes. So So, so we were debating this.
So, first off, I I think what what is
interesting about this is that it's not
a new functionality in the X app. Like
there are plenty of ways to surface
popular posts, mainly in the discover
page on the on the explore page with the
little window glass. So, you you search
there before you search, you see for
you, you see trending topics, you see
who to follow, business news. there's a
whole bunch of things that are that are
going on uh that are that are like it's
basically like new UI, new projects.
Like they could have created like a
separate tab or something like that.
They didn't do that. They just created a
an actual account on X that's native and
then they created an organization and
they just give you the organization tag
tag if you post a banger, which is uh
it's just a very interesting use of the
of like the the X primitives like the
code that's already there. Like clearly
this did not require software
engineering to do which is just
interesting way to like uh create some
new content on
>> Zoom. Zoomer says, "Did you guys
seriously not include this banger?"
We honestly need to get Zoomer on the
show.
>> I invited him
>> because he's got some truly wild takes.
Got to put him into radio format.
>> He's been on a roller coaster for sure.
But yes, so we were debating uh is the
uh is the bangers account going to be
teapot tech Twitter uh venture capital
related stuff. Will you see Naval in
there? Will you see Mark Andre Growing
Daniel Rune posts these posts that go
super viral but within tech or will it
be more broad? will we see something
from basketball Twitter or something
from you know all sorts of different uh
you know sub communities. Uh and it was
just an interesting way to to check the
the the pulse because I feel like we are
in a little corner of X but obviously
there are folks that use X and they
never interact with tech Twitter really.
They're over they're over in some other
they're talking about uh basketball or
they're talking about football or
they're talking about the Oscars or
they're in film Twitter or they're
there's so many different little
subpockets. Um, well, the result was
that they went broad. A lot of the tech
folks think it's slop, but uh, some of
these were kind of interesting. Uh, the
first one that they highlight is from
0x45 and it says, "Can y'all please tell
me the lore behind your profile picture
pictures pictures and it got 285 million
views." So, people really enjoyed quote
tweeting this. It got it got 80 or it
got 39.
>> The challenge there is that in itself is
not a banger. It just got a lot of
reach.
>> Yes.
>> Because people were quoting it. Like it
has zero value as an individual post.
>> Well, it starts a conversation. It's it
creates more content. Like it is sort of
a viral seed of of content in this weird
way in in a way that um there are
special words in that post that lead it
to generating more content than than an
average post. If if if you just posted
uh like how did you pick your profile
picture? Not a banger.
>> Yeah,
>> this the lore it specifically it
specifically worked. Uh and it obviously
did get a lot of a lot of attention, but
I agree with you that this is not
something that like sparks thought, I
suppose, or like laughter. I don't know.
What is the lore, Tyler? What's the lore
behind your profile picture?
>> Um I think it was my Halloween costume.
I was dressed up as Julius Caesar. No,
>> last year.
>> That's fine.
>> I thought that's just how you dressed
back well in during your studies.
>> Yeah, that's not exactly like deep lore,
but
>> Okay. What's the lore behind your
picture? It's just a picture of you at
Wasn't it like a stock exchange or
something?
>> Yeah.
>> There's not really deep lore, but I mean
I I could tell a whole story about it.
how uh it was at the New York Stock
Exchange for the uh Clara IPO and it was
also the day Charlie Kirk passed away or
was assassinated which was horrible. Um
so there's a lot of lore there. I don't
know but it doesn't have the same like
deep lore as
I don't know what I don't know what
people expect. Who
>> do you have any lore behind your
>> Now now I'm curious who had the biggest
quote tweet of this. Did anyone have a
really really great uh view post
engagements quotes? Um,
no one Yeah, I'm not seeing anything
that was like wild. A lot of people did
uh did um
did actually engage with this. Cold
Healing says their their profile picture
is their apartment in Peoria had a total
ivy colored ivy co covered window that I
really liked. One day in mid-spring, I
took all the furniture out of my bedroom
to take this photo. Huh. I mean, the
criticism here, the most common
criticism has been, "Congratulations,
you brought Reddit gold to X."
>> It does seem a little bit like gold. It
is even gold colored. How a
mathematician sees the world. I saw this
going viral. I didn't realize this was
this viral. 200 million views. Um, what
is the uh what is this saying, Tyler?
Did you see this? Do you know what this
why this went so viral? Just because
it's it's Is it funny specifically? Like
I
>> I don't It's just like they just drew a
bunch of lines and like random math
equations.
>> Yeah. Like is this actually how anyone
sees
>> No, it it was like everyone was quote
tweeting it like how a podcaster sees
the world.
>> Yeah. I think people were just spinning
off of it on different ways of of So it
just became a good meme template.
>> Yeah, that makes sense. What was the
other one? When your AI girlfriend was
on AWS US East one, 60 million views.
That really shows you how big the like
the tech community is or like the AWS
like balln knowowers.
>> I think this one was is closer to what
we would describe as like a normal a
banger.
>> Totally. Totally. I mean uh netcap girl
one of the first posts we reacted to on
this show. Uh great great poster.
Absolutely a banger. Um the I'm I'm
shocked that 60 million people have the
context to enjoy a post about AWS US
East1, but I guess it is a dominant
technology that lots of people interact
with. So, uh they must know uh or maybe
there's enough context to enjoy it. Um
>> well, in other news,
>> yes. What else?
Uh there is
a JP Morgan AI capex report uh and there
uh Max Weinbox says this is a great way
to put AI ROI into perspective to drive
a 10% return on our AI on our modeled AI
investments through 2030 would require
650 billion of annual revenue in
perpetuity which equates to $34.72
a month from every current
>> iPhone user.
in in perspective.
>> Ross Hendrickx says the AI math ain't
math and two ways to fix it. 20x the
revenue in the next 5 years or slash
data center capex.
I'll take the latter on 100 to1 odds. So
what does a capex pullback look like? Uh
there was another post here I I thought
was a solid. Hari Ragavan says annual US
spend on software is 400 billion.
Professional services is 2.8 8 trillion.
Logistics labor is 1 trillion.
Healthcare admin 1 trillion. Education
labor 1 trillion. That's 6 trillion.
Globally is probably 3x. Every market is
up for grabs. All of them. If you don't
get that, you aren't ready for what's
coming. 650 billion is a joke. So again,
I think uh understand the concern, but
uh when you put it in terms of every
basically every iPhone user needs to
spend $34
a month on
>> Yeah. Well, obviously it's not
correctly.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, I know. I know. But it's
>> if you're using Uber and on your phone
and Uber uh is spending a dollar per
user on AI inference just for fraud
detection, like that counts, right? It's
like it's like how much are you spending
on cloud computing? Like cloud computing
is a huge market, but you don't think
about it as like oh yeah, everyone spend
>> my household cloud budget.
>> Exactly. It's like no, there are some
customers, some companies that spend
billions and billions of dollars on
cloud hosting and then you interact with
services all over the place and the
broad cloud computing market is just
bigger than the AI market right now and
will be for a long time. When you look
at the AI capex numbers, they're all
smaller than just the traditional capex
numbers. Like the actual just building
of a normal data center is still higher
than building of an AI data center. Um,
and that's because they're actually
monetizing cloud computing very
effectively. Uh, because everyone
everyone needs a database for something
or other or or or a web hosting
platform, something like that. Everyone
needs turbuffer search every bite
serless vector and full text search
built from first principles on object
storage. Fast, 10x cheaper and extremely
scalable. Um, where else did you want to
skip skip ahead a little bit or you want
to go back to um the AI capex buildout?
Uh, it is it is very odd to put it in
those terms. I remember someone putting
Bitcoin in the same terms to me uh when
Bitcoin was at like 10K or something and
he was like, "Look, uh the math is like
in order to have like a stable price at
like the 100k price targets that people
are talking about, you would have to
have, you know, billions and billions
flowing in every day and stuff." And
it's like, and somehow that just wound
up happening. And I remember being very
convinced by this um by saying like,
"Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Like
why would how how could it possibly
become um an investment vehicle that is
constantly seeing so much demand that uh
that it can justify such a huge such a
huge price and yet like it just did
because it just worked its way into like
every single person's pension fund and
like every single person's ETFs like
have a little bit of Bitcoin in them and
like
>> Oh yeah. you stayed long even if you
thought that that scenario was crazy
because you were you you were like well
I should have some exposure if it's at
all within the realm of possibility.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. There were
more reasons to like stay long than than
actually dip out. Uh the the most
interesting point from the semi-
analysis uh segment yesterday was uh
this I did you pick up on when he when
he mentioned uh the
Tyler standing up. Tyler's rocking the
standing desk today. Uh, give us a
review. Um, how is it feeling? You you
you you haven't been standing the whole
time. You've been sitting down. You need
a
>> I like to move around. Yeah. Like stand
up, sit down.
>> Yeah. Well, we need to get you one of
the taller taller chairs. Um, but there
was uh in this in the semi- analysis
interview yesterday, um, uh, our our
guest was talking about this idea of
putting an H100 index on the stock
market. that was like something he kind
of alluded to and I feel like that would
be pretty pretty crazy and I I don't
even know how mechanically that would
work but like if all of a sudden
>> just treating it like a commodity
>> yeah but actually taking something from
currently it lives on the balance sheets
of Neo clouds and hyperscalers and
actually taking a product and just like
making it making it a commodity that you
can just invest in directly is not
really like I don't think it's very
simple. I think it I think it actually
is a complex process, but it certainly
would
potentially generate a ton more
liquidity. Like there would just be a
lot more investment dollars flowing in
if if there was like a way to like
directly get in on the AI trade by just
investing in like the underlying
>> AI capex trade is betting on AI and then
we need other people betting on the AI
capex.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I I don't know. I don't
know. I I mean like
>> derivative bets. John, so you're saying
we're going higher.
>> I mean, that's certainly what semi-
analysis was saying, and it certainly it
it just feels like uh the it was foolish
to it was it is foolish or it was
foolish to uh to sound the alarm bells
around the idea of like debt being used
at all. It's like debt is fine. Debt is
good. The question is just like are we
actually overlevered? There's not like
so when I look at like oh Meta has like
four billion of debt for this one little
side project thing. I'm like that's
still a very stable business. Like
that's not like oh they're super
indebted like they oh how are they going
to pay their debts? Like uh like there's
just a wild continuum on like how much
leverage is in the system, what that
leads to in terms of like risk. Um we're
we're we're now we're at a turning point
where we might be going really heavy
levered. Um, we might be bringing in,
you know, more ETF money. I mean, I
don't even know if there's a NeoCloud in
the S&P 500 yet.
>> Like, that is an interesting break point
because once you're in the S&P 500, you
like there is way more liquidity because
there are funds, ETFs that just buy the
S&P 500. And so, once you're in the S&P
500, you sort of have like price
support. you have extra investors that
are like lining up and they're like, I'm
riding with you no matter what as long
as you're in the S&P 500. Um, and so,
uh,
>> yeah, I mean, it's notable that Oracle
has fully roundted from before the
OpenAI announcement. So, be leading up
to the OpenAI announcement, they were at
at, uh,
>> 200 $241 a share. They're now at $235 a
share. Yeah.
>> And so, uh, the market is no longer
giving them credit for the OpenAI deal.
That is interesting. Yeah. Um well uh
>> Nabius is down 10% in the last five
days. Coreweave is down 25% in the last
5 days. And iron is down 17% in the last
five days. So
>> jitters to say the least.
>> Microsoft can't power all of its AI
chips says CEO Sachin Nadella. This from
Zero Hedge. I don't know if you want to
read through a little bit of this, but
>> yeah, the the thing that was notable
here is Cororeweave on their earnings
call yesterday was Cororeweave was
saying that they aren't power
constrained. That that's not that's not
their problem.
>> What are they what are they constrained
by?
>> I mean, they had a weaker forecast,
which is part of why it it traded it's
traded down dramatically today. But
again, they they they grew revenue 2x
and they still traded down pretty
dramatically. So,
>> well, there's more data center news from
Joe Weisenthal. But first, let me tell
you about Google AI Studio. Create an AI
powered app faster than ever.
>> Get started. Gemini understands the
capabilities you need and automatically
wires up the right models and APIs for
you. Get started at a.studio/build.
Um, Joe Weisenthal is exerpting a
Bloomberg News article uh that says,
"Two of the world's biggest data center
developers have projects in Nvidia's
hometown that may sit empty for years
because the local utility isn't ready to
supply electricity. In Santa Clara,
California, where the world's biggest
supplier of artificial intelligence
chips is based, Digital Realy Trust
applied in 2019 to build a data center.
Roughly six years later, the development
remains an empty shell awaiting
energization
stack infrastructure which was acquired
earlier this year by Blue Al Capital has
nearly has a nearby 48 megawatt project
that's also vacant. Me while the
city-owned utility Silicon Valley Power
struggles to upgrade its capacity. 48
megawatts. What are we doing here? That
seems like that's that's child's play.
>> The data center for ants.
>> That should be that should be child's
play, but they're not able to do it.
What's going on?
>> Um,
uh, Byron Deer was responding to Elon
Musk's post saying, uh, Elon was
agreeing that every AI application
startup is likely to be crushed by rapid
expansion of foundational model
providers. Uh, Byron said, "I don't buy
it at all. No chance that four companies
deliver all software value in the
future, especially as a software TAM is
growing 10x to include a labor
component."
Um, yeah, I think, um, we'll have to
see. Obviously, the the labs are
extremely ambitious, but uh I I tend to
side side more with uh
>> with Byron here that as as long as the
labs don't have uh as as long as the
labs are saying like you can access our
best intelligence
>> Yeah.
>> via API, it feels like there's going to
be durable Yeah.
>> Competition while you have open source
models, you know, lagging but not
lagging by very much at all.
>> Yeah. My current my current way to think
about this is that um the labs are new
hyperscalers as you as you've put it
before. Uh which means that they will
compete in a lot of different categories
and there will be matchups and
ultimately it will depend on the quality
of the teams. So, uh, the way I think
about like browser base versus AWS's
competitor is like, well, if Paul at
browser base goes up against the AWS
project manager and works harder and is
more creative and uh, and marshals
capital and does the right deals and
partners with uh, the one password team,
for example, uh, he can create a
sustainable business. Sometimes that
might be a duopoly. Sometimes that might
be total victory in and a lot of it
depends on the the nature of the market
that they're going after. Like is it
possible that in five years uh OpenAI
just gets completely destroyed on AI
vertical video but AI vertical video as
a category wins and that there's
actually a different startup that cracks
it and makes it great and grows it huge
like I think absolutely that's
possibility. Um, it just matters on like
there's a there's a matchup that happens
in every single category. And I don't
think it's I don't think it's fair to
say that the foundation model labs will
win every category by default or they'll
lose every category by default. It's
like Google happened to win in in email
and maps, but they lost in chat and they
lost in uh in social networking and in
RSS feeds. they they like they won in
some places, they lost in others. And
that's just the nature of these
competitions. It's like if there's a
particular team in place at one company
and then there's a startup that's, you
know, better than that team, then the
startup wins. If the team inside the
company is better than the startup, like
you get Paul Bukite uh at at Google and
he's building Gmail. I'm sure there were
a lot of email founders out there that
were trying to compete with Paul Bukite,
but Paul Bukite smoked them. Um and
Gmail is what it is today. And so I
still lean on like who are the actual
folks working on the project. Are they
are the best people inside the
organization or outside the
organization?
>> And that's how it actually
>> over on the app store charts. Chat GBT
is still number one. Threads is number
two. Shout out Connor Hayes. Uh number
three is Go Wish Your Digital Wish List.
Create wishes and get inspired.
>> Number four is Google Gemini. Number
five is Sora. So Sora is sliding down
the charts but still in the top five.
We'll have to look if Fubo can overtake
Sora.
>> Fubo.
>> That would be that would be a win for
organic media.
>> Um I am a little lost. Let me tell you
about profound. Get your brand mentioned
in chatb. Uh reach millions of consumers
who are using AI to discover new
products and brands. Um do you want to
>> did you go down post?
>> J Boldard one says calm down people.
Masa's son is a male Kathy Wood. Him
selling Nvidia today means Nvidia has
plenty of upside left.
>> It is.
>> It is. I mean, it just comes down to he
will take he's selling Nvidia. He's
going to give that money to OpenAI and
then OpenAI is going to give it to
Nvidia. So,
>> sold.
>> We will see. Um Casey Hammer, who's
coming on the show in 20 minutes, says
that remember we could automate 99.99%
of of air traffic control if it wasn't
deliberately being used as a government
funding canary. So we will have to ask
him. Uh he had another post uh earlier
this week.
>> Government canary or funded canary.
Canary. He said funding canary.
>> Casey
>> the canary in the coal mine. What is a
what is a canary? Yeah, we have to ask
him about this. I saw I saw his other
post uh which was interesting. I
realized the Doom's the Doom graphics
engine running on a pregnancy test CPU
could handle all of North American
traffic control. I'm going to sit down
for a bit. This needs to be in the
bangers. This get get this man the
bangers tag. This is such a good
>> There's an article I was curious.
There's an article here from The Verge
that says, "Digital pregnancy tests are
almost as powerful as the original IBM
PC."
>> That's insane.
>> A lot of computer to read an
oldfashioned P strip.
>> Yeah, that's what it does. You know
that, right? Like when you see those
digital tests, it's literally just like
basically pointing a camera at a at a
test strip and being like, "Did it turn
blue or not?" or "Did it turn red?"
>> No way.
>> Yeah. No, that's how it works. So, so in
so basically they make a test strip and
then it has a chemical in there and when
the person like pees on it, it like the
the the the human sample interacts with
the chemicals and turns a color.
>> And so normally you just look at and
you're like oh it turned the color like
it's pink so that means one thing or
it's blue that means another thing. Uh
but but they to make it digital they
just point a camera at it and say like
what is it looking at? I'm pretty sure I
might be wrong. Who knows? This is
probably fake news and it'll go viral on
Instagram as it always does.
>> In other news, Yan Lun says, "See you."
>> He's out.
>> He's out
>> from Meta. He's going to launch his own
startup.
>> Tyler, what's your reaction?
>> Um, I mean, this is pretty big news. I I
think people have kind of expected this
for a while. Yeah. Basically, since
Alexander Wayne came in. Um because
Alexander Wang kind of in some some
sense like took over as like the chief
AI person at Meta which was
>> not enough room in this town for two AI
>> not enough room for
>> scientists. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Uh not enough room in this town for two
chief AI scientists.
>> And and so uh Jan is like very goated AI
researcher. He's been in the game for
like super long. Yes. He did he uh I
think probably his most famous paper is
like Lynette which is like the original
uh convolutional paper
>> Lynette
>> Lynette well I I don't
>> name it after himself
>> I think that's what people call it I
don't know what the actual paper is now
that's like the it's like Alexet it's
like not actually called Alex um
>> but yeah it was like the OG
convolutional neural network paper and
then that kind of basically led into
deep learning
>> um and then the main thing is is like
>> today he's like very much seen as being
bearish on LM. Sure.
>> He doesn't think they can reason. He
doesn't think they can like do novel
tasks or whatever.
>> Um, so he's been like very outspoken
about that. I think that's maybe part of
the reason why he's he just has kind of
a different vision from from Zuck and
Alexander Wang. Um, but yeah, I mean
this is pretty big news.
>> Do you think he will raise a
private credit fund
>> and get into data centers?
>> I'm no longer interested in research and
the science behind it all. I'm
interested in finance.
>> I'm interested in finance.
>> I mean, he he has um I forget exactly
what it's called, but he has like
another kind of path that he sees to
AGI. He's he's he's still a professor at
NYU, which I think is where he does most
of his research these days.
>> Interesting.
>> Um so, I think he'll probably just stay
in academia. Does he have any active
classes going on this semester? because
if he does, we should send you onto the
campus to uh to study. Not just
>> not just from the timeline, but in in
the classroom and you can do a little
little uh
>> on the ground reporting.
>> Taylor in the chat says, "Lredit,
>> has he has he taken a formal victory lap
on scaling laws not holding?" Uh because
from your perspective, it's a preemptive
it would be a preemptive victory lap
because I know Gary Marcus was sort of
taking a victory lap with Richard Sutton
after that Dwar podcast and then Andre
Carpathy sort of like confirmed that it
might be a little bit harder to scale up
the current paradigm. Um
>> yeah, I mean I I don't think anyone is
saying like scaling up is going to get
easier, right? You just need to you need
bigger data centers. you need to like
spend way more money.
>> I I think it if I I don't think today
you can just say that like pre-training
is dead though. That's like definitely
not true.
>> Isn't Isn't that sort of Yan Lun's take
though or Richard Sutton's take or
>> I I think um
Yan Lun is is generally against all
LLMs. He's not just saying that like LM
were they were very promising and then
they kind of um fizzled out. Mhm.
>> I I think he's kind of always been
against LMS as a way to AGI.
>> Yeah.
>> Um I I think it would definitely be
preemptive to say that he was like
correct though.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. I don't want to cut you off,
Tyler, but this is more important. OTP
in the chat says Buffett is low-key a
huge boxing fan and I know at least one
gym around his state that he has at
least had a hand in funding. Oh,
>> and I looked it up and he's a huge fan
of Terrence Crawford, the boxer. Uh, and
he will go watch uh he'll go see the
fights and he likes the cheap seats
because he can see he has a better he
feels like he has a better angle.
>> That's interesting. I like that.
>> That I did not know. So, he is he's a
patron of combat. We're not ready to say
he's a patron of of of the arts, but in
some way this is Marshall.
kind of some somewhat of a martial art
down on Warren Buffett. This guy's
amazing.
>> Uh loves McDonald's,
loves boxing, apparently. Loves
allocating capital efficiently. You
know, he he he stays in his lane. Uh
it's great. Uh do we have an update from
Brian Johnson? He came back from his his
trip. He was on psychedelics.
I
feel like I'm expecting at least
one fast food restaurant. I want him to
to flip around on at least one and say,
"Okay, yeah, I'm I'm I'm an In-N-Out guy
now." Um he's been he's been quiet. Um I
I do wonder if he'll if he'll update on
anything or if he's just like so so
powered through that it just will not
affect him at all because like wasn't he
was kind of framing it as like I'm I'm
this is like a big deal. It seems like
he got through it just super fine.
>> Saw a very viral post of somebody saying
I don't think it's a good thing that
billionaires can talk about taking
schedule one
>> drugs publicly with no repercussions.
did seem that he was doing it like this
seems like such still such a gray area
where you can get it prescribed by a
doctor but it's still
>> schedule one.
>> Um he posted an update uh on on his
experience. He also talked about more
about why he says there's potential uh
it's potentially a longevity therapy for
>> uh psilocybin expands lifespan in mice.
Um, it can, uh, reduce inflation markers
tied to aging. It can increase brain
entropy, breaks rigid patterns, and
boosts long-term cognition and
flexibility.
And
>> yeah, I I don't know. I I kind of agree
with that with that uh that person who
is uh who is saying like they shouldn't
be able to talk about it publicly. I
feel like he should have a disclaimer or
something because there's gonna be
there's people he has such a huge
audience that there's going to be some
people that just look at what
>> early in the early podcast era
>> you had uh Tim
>> Ferris
>> who to his credit was like doing work on
himself
>> and would share what he was doing.
>> Yeah. But he would talk about doing
things like Ibagane, which is like a
cra, you know, super powerful
psychedelic. Yeah.
>> And he wasn't directly saying, "Hey, I
think you should go take this." But
>> when hundreds of thousands of people
like follow Tim for health advice, it
sort of is like an indirect uh it's
somewhat of an it's it's somewhat of an
endorsement even if it's not directly.
>> So,
no. No. I mean, I 100% think some people
will see this and be like, "Oh, looks
like he had a good experience. Let me
jump straight to exactly his protocol,
which is clearly not accessible for the
average person. Like, he has been
building up a tolerance to this
particular chemical for probably a
decade. And so, it's going to hit him
very differently than it will someone
who's not in the same place." We were
joking yesterday about like, oh, if he
wanted to like really challenge himself,
he would have been at like a crowded
concert or something. And there are
going to be people that see this post
and and wind up actually doing that and
winding wind up in a very very rough
spot. Um, I feel like there should be
more a little more disclaimers on this.
Like, hey, I'm I am running a crazy
experiment on myself. Like, do not try
this at home. He needs It's the It's the
You know, you ever watch Jackass back in
the day? remember it opened every every
episode opened with like don't do not
these are stunt professionals like they
do this professionally like yes they
just look like random guys but like
behind the camera there's a huge team
they are stunt men like and and even
that was still like was like okay kids
were like you know trying to trying to
jump their skateboards down too many
stairs and getting hurt um but it wasn't
like that bad but there was still like a
do not try this at home
>> I did I did see some people responding
and saying I took a similar dose to this
and it ruined basically ruined my year.
>> Terrible.
>> It took me you know months and months to
recover. So
>> yeah, I would say stay off the
psychedelics. Stay on linear because
linear is a purpose-built tool for
planning and building products. Meet the
system for modern software development.
Streamline issues, projects, and product
road maps. That's where you want to be.
You want to be locked in in linear.
>> Yeah, I do. I do. I I have I have joked
in the past. It's like is is
uh you know are psychedelics going to
fix your life or just doing the tasks
that you've been avoiding? Is that going
to make you feel relief? Yes. You know,
is that going to make you feel better
about your life?
>> It's like that meme of like the the
anime ninja, if you're tired, do it
tired. If you're sober, do it sober,
>> right? Just do it.
>> John Kugan,
>> if you're sober, do it sober. Um, well,
if you want to help make history,
>> Angelist uh is launching a new product
uh to fund uh the most creative,
hardworking technical founders building
the innovations that push humanity
forward. Uh, Angelist is hiring a
marketing lead to launch and scale this
product. Uh Eric over at Angelist, a
friend of ours and the chief legal
officer over there says, "You don't need
prior experience running a marketing
function, but you do need to be scrappy,
data driven, and comfortable in a
startup environment. Uh you'll own
marketing strategy across a variety of
channels to build awareness and drive
growth." Uh I know what this product is.
I'm very excited about it. uh and uh but
I I uh unfortunately can't share, but if
you reach out to Eric, if you DM him on
X uh and you're interested in the role,
I'm sure he can share more. Uh but uh
excited uh excited for this one to come
online uh in the next couple months.
Uh I thought this was good. Somebody
found a post from Sam Alman in 2016.
>> Oh, I didn't realize this is old. I
thought he just posted this.
>> Oh,
>> 2016, so almost 10 years ago. says,
"Digital add digital addiction is going
to be one of the great mental health
crises of our time." And Blade says, "Un
had this thought and immediately was
like, how do I profit from this? The
greatest to ever do it." DBH
>> hilarious. Hilarious.
>> Of course, Chat GBT wouldn't launch for
many many years. And
>> yes,
>> uh but in that same he was did when did
he write the merge?
>> Uh that that was like around the same
time or something. But also, I don't
know, to to be fair, like I like there
are lots of things that you could like
if you're if you're trying to like layer
up like the the Open AI is bad like
case, like you don't start with like the
product's too addictive, like I don't
think that's the claim. The claim is
like it uses too much water or it like
it it like oneshots people or it does
erotica or it's like AI slop. But very
few people are saying like, "Oh yeah,
people are on their phones too much and
it's because of Open AI now." People are
like it's people are on their phones too
much, but it's because of Instagram and
it's because of like social media.
Actually, not the AI
>> because of Sora.
>> Well, I think it's a little bit too
early to say that. I don't think it's
that I don't think it's working.
>> Certainly short short form video.
>> Have you ever been in in in like the gym
or in a coffee shop and seen someone
scrolling Sora like over your shoulder?
I haven't seen I meant I meant vertical
video broadly.
>> Totally. Totally. W- Which is I guess I
guess like a good take here, which is
like how do I profit from this? I got to
make an AI version of it. That's that's
probably like more of what they were
thinking. Um but uh but in terms of in
terms of actually profiting on uh on
like digital addiction, uh it doesn't
seem like it's going very well.
>> Yeah, for 40
seems to be extremely addictive. So much
so that
>> very for a very small amount of people
like absolutely.
>> Yeah, for sure.
>> Yeah. And we don't know how many people.
>> Yeah. You know what else is addictive?
>> Doing your sales tax with numeral
putting your sales tax on autopilot.
Spend less than five minutes per month
on sales tax compliance. Um I'm also
addicted to the Financial Times. Uh the
Financial Times has coverage of Sequoia
Capital and uh and what's going on with
uh Rolof Boa out.
>> Both of these top top lieutenants
pushed Rolof out.
>> That's what they say. Leadership duo
prepare to chart a new course at Sequoia
after ousting of Imperial. Both the uh
venture capital firms limited partners
hope Grady and Lynn can boost strategy
and bring super intense period to close.
They want to become less intense. That
is very interesting. I would not think
that. Um um okay let let's run through
let's try and understand the level of
intensity at Sequoia now and potentially
in the future. So from this article we
love seeing uh Andrew Reed there. They
they the Financial Times, let's just say
they they had to find a picture where he
was pushing where he looked like he was
pushing. They're like, you know, we're
going to tell a story about about
someone being pushed out. We need a
picture of one of the lieutenants
pushing as much as close as we can get
to that motion because that's the story
we're trying to tell. Um let's let's
figure out what's actually going on.
Sequoa Capitals Rolup Bo was ousted by
top lieutenants who lost confidence in
his ability to keep Silicon Valley's
most powerful venture firm ahead of its
rivals. Bo stepped down LA as managing
partner of the group last Tuesday
following an intervention from Alfred
Lyn Pat Grady and Andrew Reid said
multiple people with knowledge of the
matter. The trio of senior partners had
the blessing of the wider firm and
Douglone Sequoia's former managing
partner said the three of the people.
Their move came on the back of concerns
about both his management style and
questions about Sequoia's artificial
intelligence investment strategy and
followed high-profile clashes between
senior figures at the firm. The people
said Financial Times spoke to 10 people
close to the firm. It's a leaky bucket
over there in Sequoia Capital. They got
the Financial Times on speed dial, I
guess.
>> Including investors.
>> One of them was an LP.
>> Yes. You know, also also it says people
close to the firm, not necessarily
people that are actually at the firm.
It's hilarious to be like, "Oh, sorry. I
can't I have to I have to I can't be on
our on our all hands today. I have a
call." Oh, with who?
>> I'm going to the dentist, actually.
>> I'm going to the dentist. Yes, I'm going
to the
>> You went to the dentist last week. Oh,
yeah. I'm going again.
>> You're going again?
>> I have another checkup. I just got to we
just got to give props for one second to
Shawn Maguire for there being an article
about Sequoia and not being in it. I
mean,
>> round of applause.
>> Whoa, it's amazing. He's like,
>> this is the first
>> freedom. I'm not in the doghouse for
once. Oh, thank goodness. I love it.
Yeah. Props to Sean for staying out of
the dodging the bullet. You did it. They
said it was impossible.
>> Dodging the bullets. Okay. So, investors
who have worked with Botaa and
institutions that bankroll Sequoia known
as LPs. So, the LPs are snitching. The
LPS are snitching. Uh, his ousting was
motivated by a belief that a new
generation of leaders would better serve
Sequoa's LPs, they said. So, yeah, I
mean, typically if there's a change in
leadership, even a change in the GP
structure at all, you would expect an
email to go out to all the LPs. That's
probably what uh what they're leaking.
But then a lot of the LPs probably got
on the phone with people and then the
Financial Times got on the phone with
those people uh with those LPs. One of
one of those described the removal as a
revolt against both imperial style of
leadership following a period of
upheaval at one of Silicon Valley's uh
most successful and enduring firms. On
an IQ level, he is off the charts. Off
the charts.
They didn't say which way he's off the
charts.
Are they calling him zero IQ? Negative
one negative one IQ. That would be
terrible. No, they clearly mean he's
very intelligent. He's 180, 200, 300 IQ.
Who knows? Uh, but the heart of the
matter is that Roloff is one of these
people who always needs to be seen as
the smartest guy in the room.
Interesting, the person said, adding
that both his emotional intelligence did
not match his intellect. Roloff is an uh
legendary investor, a leader in human
being. Sequoa's new leadership team told
the FT.
>> I mean, it's possible he was using too
much Claude.
>> And Claude kept telling him after every
meeting he would dump in like the
meeting notes and he'd be like, "Claude,
>> am I goated?
>> Am I goatated?"
>> Like, you're definitely in the
conversation.
>> You're absolutely goatated.
>> You're absolutely right. The reason
Sequoia has stayed Sequoa for 53 years
is they've refused to cement themselves
in hierarchy. Grady and Lynn will now
run the firm while Reed and Grady will
co-lead Sequoa's funds investing in more
mature startups. So Reed is going up to
the uh to the growth stage. Uh Lynn and
another partner uh Luciana Lexandrew
will co-lead uh the firm's early stage
investment fund. So Alfred Lynn will be
doing some seedstage investing early
stage. uh BOTA who's run its US and
European businesses since 2017 and took
over the whole firm in 2022 will remain
as an adviser. The 52-year-old grandson
of Rolof Pikbotha
um the last foreign secretary under
South Africa's aparttheid regime and
later a member of Nelson Mandela's first
government was hired by PayPal uh by to
PayPal by Elon Musk early in his career.
He's led investments in Instagram,
YouTube, MongoDB.
Um, Sequoia has raised has returned more
than 50 billion uh to its US and
European investors. Despite those
successes, partners decided Lynn, who
has backed Airbnb, Door Dash, and
OpenAI, and Grady, who's behind
investments in Snowflake, Zoom, and
Service Now, were better placed to lead
Sequoia under both the Sequoia has taken
a more cautious approach to AI
investment than some rivals. invested a
little more than 20 million in OpenAI in
2021 when the chatbt maker was valued at
about 20 billion and has boosted that
stake in subsequent rounds when OpenAI
raised funds at 260 billion valuation.
Sequoia offered to invest 1 billion but
ultimately was given a stake a fraction
of that. Oo, so they didn't get their
they didn't get their 1 billion position
which still would have been less than
1%. Uh, Sequoia also holds a stake in
Musk's XAI, but has focused on early
investments in AI application companies
such as Harvey, Sierra, and Glean, an
approach also advocated by Grady. This
is very interesting. Well, uh, we have
our first guest of the show, Casey
Hanmer, in the Restream waiting room.
Welcome to the show, Casey. How you
doing? Happy Veterans Day.
>> Thank you. It's good to be here.
>> Great to be here.
>> Is this a real background? What's going
on here?
>> I mean, it's a real photograph.
>> It's a real photograph.
>> What is it a photograph of?
>> Sorry, there's a weird lag there. Uh,
that's a photograph of, uh, some sample
containers made last year of, um,
pipeline grade synthetic natural gas,
uh, made in America,
>> uh, fossil carbon free, 100%.
>> Yeah. Uh, g give us the update on on
Terraform. How how's it going? What's
the latest?
>> Oh, Terraform's going great. Yeah,
thanks. Um we're 23 strong now and uh
>> we're like literally putting finishing
touches on on our first full scale uh
synthetic fuel system. So this is a
machine that takes in sunlight and air
and produces pipeline grade natural gas.
>> Also kicked off work on a methanol
process which is kind of the other half
or the flip side of the coin. So
methanol is in the department of liquid
fuel and and natural gas is a department
of gaseous fuel.
>> Um so between those two we pretty much
covered everything that humans need. Um
and uh yeah, it's just it's kind of a a
fairly mindboggling boggling thing to
think that you know in in 100 years in a
thousand years in 10,000 years humans
who need hydrocarbons for any purpose
whether that's flying rockets or jets or
making paints and fertilizers or you
know pigments or medicines or whatever
will do so using a a solar synthetic
process and that we're building the
first one. Do you fit neatly into any of
the current uh the current
>> market
>> political I was I was going to say like
political sk uh like trends or
initiatives like uh I mean we had Isaiah
Taylor on yesterday from velar he's part
of this like group yeah just raised and
there's like four companies that it
feels like the administration is really
trying to accelerate in nuclear um it
feels like solar you know Elon's a solar
maxi there's tons of energy around solar
generally. Um, but are there specific
programs or milestones that are or just
conversations that are happening on
Capitol Hill that you're like kind of
drafting off of?
>> I mean, the the genesis of Terraform,
which actually four years ago yesterday,
was a uh
>> basically very suggestive spreadsheet.
Um, and very early on I said like I
don't I don't really want to make this
dependent on political, you know,
various political whims. And so it
hasn't been. But um but actually across
the spectrum like we we deal routinely
with you know crunchy coastal liberal
elites and and heartland Americans and
everyone in between. And uh I've never
met anyone who says they'd like their
fuel to be more expensive please.
>> Um so we're on the department of making
more fuel uh making it better, making it
cheaper, making it locally um making it
free of various geopolitical
catastrophes. And I think that actually
as I said never met an American who
disagrees.
>> Yeah. What about the AI narrative? Is
there uh is there is is are are you
drafting off of that or is it just a uh
like a separate industry that's growing
or is there is there basically a way to
lower your cost of capital by you know
doing a deal with someone who wants to
buy a bunch of uh synthetically produced
natural gas
>> press release economy
I should I should hire you guys as my
pfin
>> I mean I mean like there there's a right
way and a wrong way to do it and at a
certain point it's like if it's if it's
raining make hay right like there's just
a little bit of like, okay, maybe
there's something, but I I I'm wondering
how you're like tussling with it, like
what's real, what would be over your
skis to do, what's what's the actual
application of the technology, like take
me through the various intersections.
>> Yeah, one of the really fun things I get
to do as a as a CEO of this company is
is um, you know, basically make
spreadsheets and charts all day long and
and try and figure out how this stuff
will go. And and I've got a blog post,
you know, I like to have ideas and write
them down two years ago saying that the
way that this is going to go is we're
going to need we're going to need solar
power to power AI data centers beyond a
a significant, you know, significant
leap beyond what we're able to do with
natural gas.
>> Um and you know, people have paid
attention to that. We've had significant
inbound interest from um most of the
major players at this point um saying,
"Hey, can you help us figure out how to
do uh solar plus battery, you know,
mostly or or completely off-grid um AI
training data centers and inference data
centers?" and we said, "Sure, happy to
help." Um, and we've done done quite
well by that. Um, it's actually a very
very strong market signal that that
maybe I'm I'm in the wrong job and I
should be a energy system design
consultant rather than a CEO. But tough
luck to my stars. I'm determined to
figure out how to build a a hardware
company and manufacture stuff. Uh,
because
>> you can never have enough factories. You
can always have another factory. More
factories is more better.
As far as natural gas goes, yeah, I
mean, I think that the primary the
primary constraint that the um the AI
hyperscalers are seeing right now is in
the in the department of of methane
destruction, that is to say that the
turbons that produce power as opposed to
the department of methane creation,
which is us and then every driller
between here and uh maybe Charlotte or
something like that. Um the United
States at this point at least is is uh
you know, once again the the great
beneficiary of God's bounty when it
comes to synthetic fuel. Uh when it
comes to fuel in general, actually
synthetic fuel is is a work in progress.
um break down um
>> I would can can you say more about the
very suggestive spreadsheet?
>> Yeah, sure. Um
essentially you look at a chart and you
you try and make a prediction for what
oil will cost to produce in 5 years, 10
years, 15 years, 20 years, 25 years. I
mean peak oil, it's it's an idea that's
been around for a long long time. And of
course over time uh oil drillers are
very very studios and hardworking people
and they they figure out better ways of
getting oil out. And we've seen the
fracking revolution and I think that's
just a wonderful thing. I I genuinely do
think it's a wonderful thing. Yes, it
has certain climate you implications,
but at the end of the day, the the hum
like human welfare benefits to cheap oil
are, you know, 100 times better than the
than the climate problems caused by it.
Um, it's just a matter of fact that like
we will run out sooner or later. Um, and
so oil is unlikely to get radically
cheaper in the future. On the other
hand, solar is getting something like
40% cheaper per doubling of cumulative
production, and that takes about two
years. So, we're seeing like 20% cost
reductions per year. And when you see
something like that, it's a little bit
like, you know, um Steve Wnjak and Steve
Jobs or with Bill Gates in the 1970s
looking at the uh the the arrival of
integrated circuits and and consumer
grade uh computing systems like very
very primitive computers by today's
standards and thinking hm you know that
this this is a this is a product that
has already hit product market fit. It's
already hitting this this uh cycle of of
cost improvement. There's going to be a
big wave here. You know, how do I ride
that wave? How do I commodify that
compliment? How do I build value on top
of this platform? And I'm thinking, what
could I what could I use these cheap
solar panels for? You know, like there's
already plenty of people out there
building large utility scale solar
arrays and plugging them into uh plug
plugging them into the grid. And the
grid itself even even then was was kind
of strained by by that. And in
particular, the kind of grid development
bureaucracy was strained by that. What
else can you use it for? And I was like,
well, off-grid off-grid stuff obviously
behind the meter build a giant solar
array and then have a captive load
attached to it for, you know, AI
computing type stuff. That's an obvious
one to do. Uh, and then, you know, fuel
synthesis. Uh, fuel synthesis was was an
idea I've been thinking about for
probably 30 years at this point because
we have to do it on Mars someday. And,
um, I was saying, well, on Mars, it's
enormously expensive due to energy cost,
but energy cost on Earth is getting
cheaper. I wonder when these lines
cross. You know, if I'm able to surf
that wave of cheaper solar and I can
pass most of that value onto my
customers by keeping my costs under
control, um, then at what point should
it be cheaper to synthesize fuel rather
than dig it out of the ground and ship
it halfway around the world? And the
answer then, and I think the answer is
basically the same now, was sometime
this decade, you know, 2030 at the
outside. Uh, okay. Wonder if anyone else
has noticed this. A few people had. What
are they doing about it? Not what I
would do about it. Okay. Well, I guess I
should probably stop, you know, kicking
myself in the in the shins at NASA and
go and do this at uh go and start a
company and at least give it a go. Find
out what it's like. Uh see see if
building a hardware company is as fun as
everyone makes it sound. And um and here
we are. So uh you know I say it's a
infazard to play around on spreadsheets
too much.
>> What happens to the price of land as
solar uh as as solar energy production
costs uh decline?
>> Yeah, that's a good good question. Um
because because ultimately the the value
of of land under solar is the value of
what people are willing to pay for that
power and things they do with that
power. Um and so what we've seen for
example is that um the value of land
under solar is something like a 50 100
times higher on a per acre basis or per
revenue basis than than your kind of
average agriculture even in a fairly
developed agricultural state like the
United States. And that's the same for
synthetic fuel. Um the the flip side
actually and the thing that I worry
about in terms of AI safety is that um
it's pretty clear to me that the uh
economic utility of of land that's being
used as solar array to power an AI data
center is over $100,000 an acre at
present value. And that's just higher
than almost any kind of existing human
use other than particularly dense and
and large cities. Um which makes me
wonder maybe not in 10 or 20 years but
in 30 or 40 years whether the AIS will
encroach upon our agricultural land and
make it harder for us to eat.
>> Yeah. this runaway AI that just decides
it's in my best interest to blanket as
much of the US or the world as I can
with solar uh to you know further
myself.
>> Yeah, I mean it seems to create a strong
economic forcing function and maybe we
can slow it down a few years with usual
regulatory uh stuff. Um but I think that
may be one of the reasons why why Elon
has been talking more about um doing
large scale AI development in space. If
you can convince the the AIs they're
better off doing it in space where they
don't have to fight with humans, maybe
they'll go there first instead of I mean
there's there's there's plenty of land
on Earth. There's there's more land on
Earth that's not being farmed than there
is land that is being farmed. But, you
know, just not inexhaustible.
>> Um something like a 100 100,000
terowatts uh lands on the oceans and
50,000 terowatts lands on parts of the
earth that no one lives on or uses and
humans consume about 10 terowatts of
energy. So, there's plenty to go around
for now.
>> Yep.
>> For now. That makes sense. Uh I want to
get into NASA government shutdown, bunch
of stuff. But uh before let's touch the
third rail.
>> No, let's let's No, let's go even more
skitso. Uh Tucker had a guest on the
show yesterday uh that was uh talking
about talking about chemtrails. Uh
what's your take on
>> on uh on on uh chemtrails?
>> I'm I'm a pilot and I've I've flown
around a fair bit and I've never seen
one. Um I think I think that uh like you
know playing around in kerosene is not
very good for you. Um and and we we do
see like health impacts from people who
live too close to freeways and things
like that. You know there are
>> definite health impacts from from
burning the longer chain hydrocarbons.
Um as far as chemtrails go
>> I must confess I'm not not as deeply
familiar with uh
>> various conspiracy theories like that.
Although I do think that NASA's been
covering up life on Mars. So we'll see
about that.
>> Covering up life on Mars.
>> Yeah. Before we talk about life on Mars,
the uh chemtrail thing is funny because
you have to believe that that you know
tens of thousands of people are
coordinating to do this largecale
operation. Not not not one of them has
ever come out and said hey here here's
here's here's evidence that you know
this massive operation is is happening
without
>> there are aircraft which spray chemicals
right like they call crop dusters. you
have crop testers
>> and they have a very particular look and
feel
>> of course
>> um and then and of course if you if you
if you spend much time doing like
structural calculations um and you you
look closely at say a trip 7 or
something it's pretty clear that um that
um sorry my son's at work today and he
just wanted to see if he'd come in um
>> it's a familyfriendly show
>> Veterans Day.
>> Yeah. Yeah. His face is not on the
internet though nor is he a veteran if
he was and hopefully never will be. um
uh crop to aircraft. You know, I fly to
Australia every now and then and you're
like,
>> you know, actually the conspiracy theory
that that planes can't contain enough
fuel makes more sense to me because it
seems unlikely to me that that you could
actually keep a plane that big up in the
air for 14 hours and cross an entire
ocean like halfway around the world.
>> Oh yeah.
>> Like where where where are you putting
all the all the chemtrails you're
spraying out? Like in the overhead bin,
there's never any room in there.
>> So I don't understand
>> like Yeah. Yeah. We got plenty of space.
Let's bring the fuel and the and the
toxic chemicals or whatever. Yeah. Yeah,
I mean there there are there are levels
to the to the conspiracy because there
is just the world of like what if it's
just like leted gasoline where it's like
sort of the chemicals are deranging
people in a bad way because it's just
pollution. Like I don't think people
really debate that like
>> the possibility of pollution is
happening. It's different when it's like
okay yes it's like specific chemical
that does a specific thing and and
triggers a specific reaction from the
population. I mean there are plenty of
chemicals that can make you crazy. Most
of them taste very good.
>> Really? Like what?
>> Stevia,
>> diet coke. No, I mean likeite quite
literally like until the invention of
GLP1 agonists like something like a
third to a half of Americans were going
to die quite younger than they otherwise
would because of
>> you know weight weight related heart
disease and obesity. Why? Because sugar
tastes good.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Okay. So that's a poison. It's actually
poisoning you. It's it's actively
degrading the quality of life.
>> Ray Ray Pete would would disagree. But
uh why are we covering up life on Mars?
Yeah.
>> Um,
so to be fair, you know, you don't want
to be the boy who cried wolf and shut
it's aliens. It's aliens. It's aliens.
Um, but so so so what tends to happen in
in these um in in scientific fields is
it becomes very fashionable to be quite
skeptical
>> of of things as as it should be. Um but
at the same time, you know, evidence
will accumulate over time and and so
you'll have this kind of neat cottage
industry of people who can explain away
any evidence they see um without uh
without necessarily updating their their
prior prior knowledge or prior
assumptions about it.
>> And I I I was trained at Caltech by the
geologist um uh I've forgotten his name.
This is age. Okay, it's coming to you.
It'll come back to me eventually. Uh
Kosh Joe Koshank and um a legend legend
among men. And uh and he was the guy who
who when he got his sample of ALH84001,
a Martian meteorite that was found in
Antarctica a while ago now um that uh he
he he identified these um cubo like
hexahedraledral
magnetite crystals um that that were in
the meteorite. It's it's
non-controversial that they were found
in the meteorite. Uh and it's also never
ever been demonstrated they can be made
by any known lab process other than
culturing magnetactic bacteria that use
them for navigation. um essentially. So,
so you know the meteorites are full of
magnetite. Magnetite is a naturally
occurring mineral, but there's a
particular configuration of of of it
crystallin form which we we only know
can occur. We only know of ways it can
occur with biological precipitation. So,
>> um yeah, that's that's it's called the
magneto fossil if you want to Google it
at home. And I think it's it's it's
about as strong as evidence as you could
possibly hope for finding without
actually going there and kicking rocks
yourself.
>> Are you familiar with this thing, the
great unconformity in the Grand Canyon?
Have you ever heard of this? Yeah, I've
been there. Yeah.
>> Can you explain this to me? It Somebody
sent this to us. You got to talk about
this on the show, and I was just going
to read the Wikipedia, but now we have
someone who actually is familiar with
it.
>> Not an expert.
>> I don't want to pop quiz you, but like
it would be cool if
>> No, I've been there. I've been there.
I've been there several times. It's it's
it's amazing. I've taken my kids there.
Um so so if you go to the southern rim
of the Grand Canyon, uh there's a trail
called the Bright Angel Trail, and if
you're very very fit and it's not too
hot, you can walk down to it and back in
a day. Um but I would recommend starting
at midnight, right? you get down to it
in the early morning and then and then
um you know after after after daybreak
but then you get back up before it gets
hot
>> or take a couple of days enjoy it. Um
but there's also an exposure just
northeast of Vegas at a place called
Frenchman Mountain which you can just
drive right up to although last time I
was there it's unfortunately covered in
broken glass.
>> Um okay great unconformity so uh over
time you know the the oceans rise and
fall due to climatic variations and also
land rises and falls due to geological
stuff. Um, and when land is above sea
level in general, it's it's eroding. And
when it's below sea level, it's in
general accumulating sediment. And so
what you see in the Grand Canyon, that
is to say the the most of the Grand
Canyon is a series of layers of of
carbonates, which means it's it's
shallow oceans that are forming reefs
and and sand sandunes and sand
sandstones, which means it's um you
know, rivering kind of delta environment
or something where where the land is
gradually sinking relative to the ocean,
creating an accommodation space in which
um which uh new new uh dirt and soil and
rocks and stuff can can come down and
fall and and be compacted and form these
layers. Um, and then what happens is if
the if the ocean falls down or or the
land gets lifted up, uh, then you then
you see erosion. And what happens is
that is that newly formed rock gets
eroded away for a while and then it
sinks again and then it starts to build
up again. And so you get these like what
are called little unconformities, which
is where you've got a little period of
missing time, a million years here,
100,000 years there, 10 years over here,
and maybe 10 million years over there
where where the land has been above sea
level, and so no new rock has been
forming or if it has, it's since been
eroded away.
>> Okay, so this occurs at all scales. And
it turns out that the at the bottom of
the Grand Canyon or very close to the
bottom is a thing called the great
unconformity. And it's kind of
mindboggling because the rocks on on one
side of this are this kind of the Vishnu
shist basement rock. It's this ancient
rock that forms the you know the core of
our North American continent at least in
this place. Um it's it's ancient at
crystal. It's 1.6 billion years old.
It's like what 13% of the age of the
universe. And then literally like one
thumbs width away from that above it is
the the oldest sedimentary rocks in the
Grand Canyon which are 500 million years
old. I think they're just after the
after the um
>> the uh um
Cameron explosion. Um okay, this is
stretching my memory. This is a long
time ago now. 535 million years ago. And
it's just kind of crazy. So, so what
happened in there?
>> It's a missing billion years.
>> It's a missing billion years. And so,
>> so, so in that time rock formed, right?
>> Sure.
>> And probably entire mountain ranges
formed. Like it takes it takes a 100red
million years to form a mountain range
and then eroded away to nothing.
>> Sure.
>> Right. So like the Appalachian Trail,
the Appalachian Mountains were were a
mountain range taller than the Himalayas
130 million years ago. Pretty much
eroded away to nothing. Um so you could
form and destroy a mountain range the
size of the Appalachian mountains
>> in that time.
>> 8 n 10 times in that time. Entire
continents form and sink. Entire superc
continents form and sink. Probably not
dinosaurs back then as far as we know.
But but there was definitely like life
in lots of life in the oceans and and
some plants and stuff on on land and
some insects and things. Um actually
insects I think came later. Look, don't
quote me on this. Check Wikipedia. Ask
Grock. Um,
>> but it's all gone. It's all gone. At
least,
>> you know, and and and when you look at
one of those geological time scales, you
see a lot of recent rocks and not so
much detail in the older rocks. And
that's just cuz like as you go back in
time, you get exponential destruction of
of the geological record. There is
actually a corner of the eastern Grand
Canyon where what's called the Grand
Canyon Supergroup, which is a a series
of layers that's inclined like this kind
of pokes up. And that's the only place
on Earth that we have rocks from that
age. It's kind of an intermediate
intermediate age rock. Um, yeah, it's
just bizarre. So you can go there. You
could just outside Vegas like skip skip
the tables for half a day, drive out and
uh
>> maybe they could put a casino at the
great unconformity.
>> I mean on on the Wikipedia page, the
reason this is so interesting is because
on the Wikipedia on the Wikipedia page
it says there is currently no widely
accepted explanation for the great
unconformity among geoccientists. There
are hypotheses that have been proposed.
It is widely accepted that there was a
combination of events which may have
caused such an extreme phenomenon. One
example is a large glaciation event
which took place during the Neoproto
Zoic around 720 million years ago. Um
and so there's like a whole bunch of
theories but there's like how did they
grind away so much so much rock?
>> Yeah.
>> Because because essentially like where
this where the rock is forming and being
destroyed is very close to sea level
almost always.
>> Right.
>> Yeah.
>> And and so at some point the rock that
is on the underside of the great
unconformity had to have been lifted up
near sea level. Mhm.
>> And then it has to have sunk down a mile
or two to form all the rocks above it,
right? And now it's been lifted up again
above sea level because the bottom of
the of the Grand Canyon, the Colorado
River is obviously above sea level.
Otherwise, it wouldn't float to the
ocean.
>> Um, so it's kind of crazy that this goes
up and down. Um, yeah, I mean that's
geology for you. There's still work to
be done. Um, maybe you'll figure it out
one day.
>> Okay, forming a new great unconformity,
right? Like the the rocks below the
Grand Conformity, the Vishnu shift are
being eroded by the Grand Canyon as we
speak. So if the Grand Canyon ever fills
in and starts to, you know, build rocks
again in the future, the the Great
Unconformity will be below where it is
now
>> in that part of the world.
>> Okay. Well, let's let's talk about
something we can all agree on, which is
three Atlas. What's going on with that?
>> What? I don't know anything about this.
>> You know, this is a comt.
>> Yeah. Some people think it's a they're
saying it's a comet. A lot of
celebrities are saying it's a an alien
ship, but what's the Casey Hanmer? Give
us a breakdown on We haven't been
following it. there's been enough
uh in technology.
>> Likewise, I've been focused mostly on
the finer details of like fixing
electrolyer seals and things like that.
>> I would say that these interstellar
objects are super interesting and I
would like to get a close look at them
and I really wish that we had some like
maybe Tom Mueller could build a series
of spacecraft with like lots of onboard
ISP that we park out, you know, near the
moon or something and then when we one
of these comes through, we press the
button and it immediately like adjusts
its orbit and shoots off in that
direction and we get a nice flyby. we
get a few photos. Um, that'd be super
cool. We're seeing them about once a
year at this point and that's just cuz
our our telescopes have gotten better.
As far as Atlas goes, um, I have a
cousin who who routinely texts me
updates on like it's an alien ship for
sure. Um, I I don't think it is. I think
it's a comet. I think that actually some
of the earlier ones will be better than
it. I think it's a very large comet, a
very old comet. Um, seems to be a comet
to me. But
>> but if you were a sufficiently advanced
alien, you know, uh race, would you not
want to just attach yourself to a comet
that was headed in the direction you
wanted to go and just ride along with
it?
>> No.
>> No. I think I think um
>> too slow.
>> Well, so I I went Oh, yeah. Exactly. I
went Well, who knows how long the aliens
live, but I I went to I went to Celtech
to study kind of warp drive to try and
understand how to do that, and I didn't
succeed, obviously. Um but someone might
one day. Um, but I think that uh if
you've seen Avatar 2, the the spaceships
that Jim Cameron puts there for the
humans to fly to Alpha Centuri are like
kind of what I have in mind when I think
like how would how would humans or
aliens that are comprehensible and
legible to humans travel. It' be
something like that, you know,
enormously energetic uh relativistically
uh accelerated, very very bright, very
flashy, very obvious. Um or or maybe
something like Warp Drive if we can ever
figure it out. Um but I think you know
comet that takes 100,000 years to kind
of wander its way from the nearest star
to here. Very boring. Very boring. Yeah.
Boring. Yeah.
>> Uh Moon, Moon or Mars. This was a debate
that we were having earlier. Seems like
uh the Jared Isaacman nomination was
kind of reinvigorating some discussion
over whether the US should prioritize
Mars over the moon. Elon has been pro
Mars for a very long time. Moon is kind
of incidental. Uh other folks see moon
as like a key geopolitical race that we
have to address right now and win and
then that gets you a ticket to the real
the real competition which is Mars
potentially. Uh how are you thinking
about the tradeoffs between resources
spent going to the moon resources spent
going to Mars?
>> Um
so initially I was quite pro Mars. Um,
and I wrote a couple of books about uh
doing stuff on Mars and realized that,
you know, its advantages are actually
like both both both destinations are
pretty difficult in their own way. Um,
they both have their challenges. Um, and
and actually I think what SpaceX
correctly realized is that if you're
going to do anything meaningful on
either place, you have to develop a
rocket system like Starship
>> that can basically uh fire hose mass at
pretty much any target in mind. Um, you
know, it's not a fair fight, you know,
kind of situation. And um and so once
you have something like a starship, you
know, doing something pretty cool on the
moon is very straightforward. Um but if
you're if you're constantly trying to
put together some mission that's like
just made of like little bits and pieces
and and small puny rockets and very
expensive, you know, slow going
contracts and stuff, you really struggle
to do anything meaningful on either of
them ever. Um, so yeah, I'm I'm very
much in favor of of uh, you know, kind
of incidentally on the way to Mars,
setting up a couple of lunar research
stations and putting a few thousand
people there and running it like the
space station is now, but for more than
six people.
>> Yeah.
>> Um, and I think we could totally do that
for like Antarctica program level budget
with Starship.
>> Yeah. My my my theory on it just as you
know an outsider has always been uh fire
hose mass at low earth orbit. Get
Starlinks going every day. Tons of I
love those montages that are just
showing Falcon 9's up and back every
single day. Do that in low Earth orbit.
then do that for the moon and same thing
like like dozens of flights to the moon
and back every single day and then and
then start you know weaving to the to
Mars because it feels like Mars is just
a completely different uh set of of
tradeoffs and cadences based on when we
can actually launch. It's not every day.
And so, uh, just getting the reps in of
like humans, just even just a human or I
don't know, maybe a robot at some point.
Uh, like getting off of a like landing a
rocket on a celestial body and then
getting out and jumping around. Like
even if that's if that's happening every
single day, it's going to be that's a
lot of that has to transfer to Mars, I
would imagine.
>> What's the most underrated planet?
>> Yep.
>> H underrated planet.
What's a planet that you think about a
lot?
>> I spent a lot of time thinking about
Mars.
>> Mars still underrated.
>> Mars.
>> Most people would put it at their number
two after Earth.
>> Yeah. I had a little little side project
where I I built like the highest
resolution topo map of Mars using um
using a bunch of like NASA data that's
kind of in the archives, not not being
directly funded. So I have I have a 6 m
resolution global topog topography map
of Mars. Um, and I've been doing some
like hydraology simulations and stuff
with it to see what happens when we
terraform.
>> It's um, yeah, so it's kind of hard to
appreciate, but like planets, even small
planets like Mars are overwhelmingly
big. Once you start dealing with these
planetary scale data sets, it's like 200
terabytes. You know, I start asking my
wife, "Can I please buy another hard
drive?" And she's like, "You've already
spent $5,000 on hard drives this month.
Maybe you should slow down." And I was
like, "Well, okay." But like, planets
are really, really big. And yet I have
a, you know, almost photorealistic
render of of Mars to, you know, sub 100
meter resolution sitting on a on a
spinning platter on my desk at home.
It's pretty wild.
>> That's pretty cool
>> that we get to do that. I could never
have dreamed of that when I was a kid.
It's just unimaginable.
>> Yeah.
>> Air traffic control. Should it be run by
>> a pregnancy test?
>> Pregnancy test.
>> No, I don't think so. Um, but it could
be. Uh so so you know I mean at the end
of the day like the the shoulds the the
normative discussion is is kind of
beyond my pay grade but the descriptive
discussion of like whether whether it
could is something that I think I can
appine on and um
>> and yeah I mean fundamentally what a a
graphics uh you know system does on a
computer is it's doing you know roughly
a billion collision calculations a
second and
>> um that that's a much more sophisticated
uh graphics engine than than Doom but
but still it's something that you can
buy in any PlayStation or something
today. Um, and ATC is just not that
complicated,
>> right? It has it has a bunch of edge
cases, but it's not that complicated.
And and it's also a a system that for
justifiable reasons is very very um
conservative about adopting new
technology, but at the same time, you
know, the the cost that we endure as a
as a civilization to um various uh air
traffic control problems and they're not
only caused by government shutdowns
>> um kind of undeniable. And there's also
an efficiency aspect. you know, we could
probably shave 5% of our uh fuel usage
if we were able to have basically
weather weather optimal director uh
pointto-oint flights for for all
aircraft that that wanted them rather
than the usual ATC thing, which is, you
know, basically follow existing uh
instrument approved routes between in
many cases like places on maps that were
once radio navigation beacons but no
longer exist.
>> Yeah. You mentioned uh giving it giving
the project to the MAG 7. Uh, I wonder,
do you think that there's an opportunity
for a startup to sort of do like the
Anderoll flipped model, build it with
venture capital dollars, then try and
sell it to the government once you have
a better system in place? And also, is
the actual software and hardware like
actually the problem? There was that uh
Nathan Fielder HBO special that was kind
of like
>> it's maybe more about pilot
communication and human training, human
error when something goes wrong and it's
not necessarily like a computer system
and like a bad line of code.
>> Yeah, I think you probably still want to
have have people sitting in in control
towers looking at radars. Yeah. Um I'm
not saying like the the solution to our
problem is to fire every last air
traffic controller. M
>> um quite the opposite but like if you
think about what those air traffic
controllers are doing a lot of the time
it's stuff that could be a few lines of
code right like it's one of these things
we got I know a thousand corner cases
but 99.99% is just one case it's just
the standard like
>> did these intersect
>> instrument in instrument routing well
just like you basically get a clearance
to fly to fly a certain route at a
certain time and then you know all goes
well you'll never see another plane um
but you know every now and then you've
got to got to keep an eye on things you
got to control the airspace. M yeah
>> it's not it's not a complicated puzzle.
I mean like uh Microsoft Flight
Simulator 95 had a pretty good
simulation of this. So it's the sort of
thing that I think is uh well well
within our technical capabilities.
>> Yeah. Something that we actually want to
do.
>> Yeah. I guess to some degree you can
forecast the entire flight path before
the plane takes off and make sure that
it does not intersect with any other
flight paths at any point in time.
>> Yeah, that's relatively straightforward.
I think I think some people on X were
like, "Oh, you know, sure, we should
just hand another monopoly to to Starink
to do all this stuff." I think actually
I don't think that's the case. I think
that you could actually design a series
of algorithms that would run centrally,
but also autonomously on every aircraft.
And so you have like everything in in
aviation is these like multiple layers
backups. Um so so there's always always
something checking the checking the
system that um uh sorry and a co-orker
just brought in a new baby cuz uh I I
start this company and then all my
employees start having more children. I
think I'm doing something right.
>> That's that's a great sign. Yeah. Um but
um
uh yeah. So so the so the idea there is
like your your onboard computer on board
your aircraft if you're flying a you
know commercial 737 or something should
be like getting minute-by-minute updates
on weather and tailwinds and headwinds
and so on and being like well you know I
can save 5 cent fuel fuel if I go up
1500 ft you know route into the jetream.
Sorry about the bumps everyone. and and
we get the rift faster and um and then
it just kind of automatically does the
flocking thing where it it it sees and
avoids and and doesn't uh intersect with
other other aircraft. Um but yeah, just
just the the technology adoption cycle
at the FAA is understandably and you
know airlines and and um aircraft
manufacturers understandably are pretty
conservative, but it's also very very
slow and so we end up with a situation
where where you know delays and and
actual crashes and stuff are occurring
because the system is not as good as it
could be. So, I think the the way I mean
it's way beyond my pay grade, but the
way you would do this is you would you
you'd uh basically commit to buying or
purchasing a family of of improved
products that are interoperable
according to some pretty straightforward
standard. Um you could base it on, you
know, Australia and Europe has largely
automated ATC at this point. Um and uh
and then you integrate systems automated
>> what is there already?
>> Europe automated traffic control.
>> Europe and Australia is a terrible place
to be a pilot, right? Like in the United
States, you can you can fly VFR like as
when I was a private pilot, I flew VFR
visual flight rules under 18,000 ft.
>> You can you can do basically anything
you want and I don't know if the uh if
the ATC systems could could handle that
quite yet, but when I was flying, we
didn't have ADSB rolled out very well.
So, you know, basically you had to look
out the window all the time and try and
spot out the aircraft.
>> Yeah.
>> Um
>> Yeah.
>> Do you have a take?
>> Pretty pretty dicey in LA sometimes.
>> Do do you have a do you have a strong
take on the AI capex buildout? It feels
like um I I I just feel like your
company and a lot of the a lot of the
companies kind of of your vintage are
very much aligned with like do something
really ambitious that as it scales it
compounds and all of a sudden like once
it's working you're marshalling like I I
do imagine when I think about your the
story of your business I think about um
you know billions and billions of
dollars flowing into more and more solar
panels and just this crazy flywheel once
the technology gets working. We've
talked about this in the past. It feels
like that's kind of happening in the
context of like token factories right
now. Um, but are there anything that
that has given you jitters to the
structure or how things are playing out
or do you or or do you see it as like um
uh as like one narrative is just like it
it's felt cool to watch big things get
built and I'm wondering like how you're
processing like the AI capex build out
all the crazy capex that's going on.
Um,
I think the United States has always
done well when they're able to take a a
difficult problem and transform it into
a form that could be solved by pouring
money on it and then pouring money on
it.
>> Yeah.
>> Um,
>> let's give it up for pouring money.
>> Yeah. And so
if um if someone were to ask me like, do
you really think that every dollar being
spent on hyperscaling right now is being
spent the best possible way it can? No,
of course not.
>> Yeah. Right. Um but is it nevertheless
efficient uh from a perspective of
competition to to spend as quickly as
they can to ramp this technology up
right now?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I mean there's obviously a there
there I use all the models every day.
It's
>> um I'm a discerning customer and I think
that's quite transformational. I mean
they frustrate me as well but like
>> that the the the direction of
improvement is very clearly going in in
one direction. Mhm.
>> Um and this is not a a race where United
States can afford to be anything but
first.
>> And uh and I think it's a real question
to wonder like what what does the UN
Security Council look like in 15 20
years when
>> um uh when you know basically most of
them today have their own nukes and I
think they actually UN Security Council
permanent members all have their own
nukes these days. Um and in the future
most of them will not have their own uh
AI sovereignty. Oh, do you think that
the AI sovereignty projects are not
going to bear fruit because they're
under scoped or undercaled?
>> Because I feel like a lot of countries
would say like you just answered the
question, but a lot of countries
>> we're doing a we're doing a one gigawatt
data center like we're good. We're
checking the
>> United States is is deploying hundreds
of billions of dollars in this direction
right now. And and how much is I mean
China I I guess is serious about it. Do
you think Russia is serious about it?
>> It does not seem like
>> UK and France are. It does not seem
>> some of Russia Russia's biggest clusters
are like a thousand GPUs.
>> Australia we did hear is investing in
quantum computing. Do you think that
that's going to be relevant?
>> No.
>> Can you say more?
>> Just sent the market down. I can I'll
say I'll say it in Australia
has this has like basically the best
solar resource on earth and and it has
you know it's a modern western liberal
democracy with like rule of law and
>> and uh incredible natural resources and
and 25 plus million well educated
wealthy people.
>> Yeah.
>> And and every time there's a new wave of
technology they go ah never mind mate
we'll catch the next one.
>> We'll catch the next
>> and
drives me crazy. Um, so, um, so that's
why I'm here. Um,
>> but they have Kira. Yeah.
>> You ever surfed? You ever surf there?
>> It's one of the best point breaks of all
time.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, the beach is doing
comparable. And like I live in I live in
the San Gabriel Valley, but I come to
Santa Monica about once every two years
under duress, I will add, and people
say, "Oh, Santa Monica, it's the most
amazing beach." I'm like, "Yeah, maybe
if you're like from, I don't know, like
Canada or something." But, uh, I grew up
on I grew up on Kilk Beach in, uh, in
the central coast of New South Wales.
It's I would I wouldn't I wouldn't swap
all of Santa Monica for like a single
bucket of sand from that beach.
>> It's the best sand.
>> Absolutely incredible.
>> Best sand on Earth.
>> You've been there. You've surfed in
Australia. Australia. I didn't know
that. That's good.
>> Yeah. Um,
>> EVPN down under.
>> Yeah, we need to mark your calendars.
>> Down Under. I I like I like
>> I love Australia feels like a just a
very large
>> Fosters
>> California. It feels like California as
a continent.
>> A violet crumble. That'll get me going.
I love crumble.
>> Last thing I was curious to get your
take on. Uh this company T1 Energy went
super viral last week because they're
just making a massive amount of solar
panels. Everyone got really excited
because including ourselves saying,
"Wait, we know how to build things." uh
and turns out it was a Chinese company
that was like a forced
>> seller of their uh of their
manufacturing facility. Do you think
there's anything that we can learn from
T1 Energy and and what what the the
original kind of builders of this
facility facility did in terms of like
just scaling that out?
>> I I haven't actually heard the story so
I'm not the right person to comment.
>> Yeah, T1 Energy I mean you you would
you'd be interested in the story. It's a
It's a eight $800 million stock. They're
making one gigawatt worth of solar a
year. And people got really excited.
>> Tiny.
>> That's tiny.
>> Yeah. I mean, like globally, we're going
to make 1.4 terowatts of solar this year
and deploy about 700 gawatt.
>> Yeah. So,
>> yeah.
>> Uh, a couple years ago, I used to say
it's it's about one megawatt per minute,
but now it's it's closer to one megawatt
every 40 seconds.
>> 40 seconds.
>> So, you know,
>> we got to get those kind of nuts.
>> Okay.
>> And and so is is Are you like in
are you
>> two billion modules this year?
>> Like would you encourage one for every
family on Earth?
>> Would you encourage America or like the
like the venture ecosystem or the
government to like to like try and bring
you know manufacturing capacity back to
America because when we've talked about
this before you've always said like hey
if China's going to be subsidizing it
just buy as much as possible. And that
makes sense like economically, but over
the long term like if you need to scale
exponentially there there might be a
case for reshoring. Do you think that
that's a good a good idea?
>> Yeah, I think controlling supply chain
for for solar technology is super
important. Um and uh and just because
China currently leads doesn't mean the
US can't lead in the future. I mean
we've we've seen this in the past,
right? Yeah.
>> Um the the industry is extremely
dynamic. You wouldn't have to try all
that hard to if you had like a 5% edge
over your competition, you could be the
number one in 5 years or something like
that, right? Um uh much different.
>> Why didn't you look into that or why
aren't you vertically integrating? Uh is
that just something that might happen in
the future?
>> I mean, it might be the last thing we
vertically integrate. It's it's a well
it's well it's not really a problem for
venture or government, right? It's a
problem for banks.
>> Sure.
>> Right. It's like buy buy the machine
from from Germany. put it in a shed, put
it in a giant building and start turning
them up. So, it's it's it's pretty well
understood how to do this scale.
>> Um, it's not really a technology
problem.
>> Um, technology development problem, but
that's my bread and butter. My bread and
butter is like doing doing weird
complicated stuff.
>> Is the reason that it's in China mostly
labor cost or environmental concerns or
regulation or just the cost of capital?
Do you have an idea of like like I
understand like the whole story of Yeah.
the whole story of like why the iPhone
landed there. Like I understand that
story a little bit. I don't necessarily
understand why solar panels went there
specifically.
>> Yeah. I mean, Australia invested a bunch
of money into developing this technology
and and then Germany spent a bunch of
money on manufacturing it at a steep
loss
>> and both of them basically gave up at
some point. And meanwhile, China looked
around and said, "hm, we just had the
Beijing Olympics. We're kind of a big
deal now." And uh um you know we we'd
like to do something about Taiwan sooner
or later, but the last time anyone got
uppety in the East Eastern China Sea
area. Um they they they did a lot of
damage until until the United States
curb stomped them with uh by choking
their supplies of of energy.
>> And it turns out that neither Germany
nor Japan had had anywhere near
sufficient supplies of of the domestic
energy sources. And once the combined
bomber offensive and the the um the the
submarine war took out their ability to
transport oil from where it was being
made to where it was being used,
>> basically both war efforts collapsed
within months. So if you're China, you'd
be like, "Hm, where's my oil coming
from?" You know, 16 12 million barrels a
day is coming from uh coming from Middle
East
>> a long way away via via like the straits
of Aman straits of Malaca, straits of
the straits of Malaca, which we don't
control, can't control. Don't have a
deep water blue water navy. um you know
via via our you know historical and and
current geopolitical adversaries uh who
kind of allow the oil to pass by because
they're they're playing nice today right
like hm maybe maybe it's actually
something we should spend you know
because the US sorry the Chinese um
political economy is is much more kind
of expansionary and it's spending it's
much more um supply driven rather than
demand driven um so if we're going to
spend a bunch of money on like you know
more or less inflationary projects may
as well spend them on giant solar panel
factories and they got really good at it
>> and you know all credit to them like
it's It's a bloody lot of hard work to
do that and they did it. Um and um now
basically we all benefit from that you
know if we willing to buy from them but
that doesn't mean it's something that's
like intrinsically impossible for the
United States to do. Um you know it's
it's just a question of will. It's just
a question of who who actually wants to
go and do this at scale.
>> Mhm.
>> Always a pleasure.
>> Always a pleasure.
>> Thank you for taking the time. after you
after you create abundant energy, uh
we're going to require that uh or we're
going to make a a bid for you to become
a uh
>> you know a more uh invest more of your
time in podcasting.
>> Yes. Yes, we do enjoy this.
>> That' be hard to do at this point. I've
been showing
>> Yeah, you have. You've been on a tear.
Congratulations. You've been uh you've
been all over. Uh
>> I know your secret that sitting around
talking about stuff is is incredibly
fun.
>> It's so much fun.
>> It really is.
>> Well, thanks for doing it with us today.
>> Great to see you. coming by.
>> Uh, talk soon.
>> Happy Veterans Day. We'll talk to you
soon.
>> Uh, let me tell you about Finn.AI, the
number one AI agent for customer
service, number one in performance
benchmarks, number one in competitive
bake offs, number one in ranking on G2.
Uh, we have a surprise guest joining us
in just a few minutes. We'll see if he
can join in the uh, Reream waiting room.
He says he's down to join. Um, in the
meantime, let's go through some more
post. What else? Back in the timeline.
Um, there's some news in the Wall Street
Journal.
>> You see some of these images leaking
from Nano Banana 2.
>> No. What is this?
>> Uh, they are a little too uh
photorealistic for for my
>> interesting.
>> Uh, for my preference.
>> Okay. What's going on here?
>> Oh, wow. Okay. So, it's got Jeffrey
Epstein and
>> with Diddy Diddy together.
>> These are very accurate images. These
seem remarkable. Third term. Um yeah, is
this uh so this is from Roberto Nixon
who's who came on our stream at Meta
Connect. He says, "Wild Times Nano
Banana 2 apparently leaked a few hours
uh today on some platforms and the
limited results by a handful of users
have been pretty insane. The model was
apparently from an uncensored slightly
older checkpoint. when it actually
launches, it won't be this uncensored,
of course, but crazy to think what a
handful of engineers at the Frontier
Labs have access to and the chaos they
could cause if they so wished. Um, I
wonder Yeah, it's so it's so interesting
where I I would love to actually trace
where these leaks came from, what the
whole flow is, because um it's possible
that uh like it's possible that there's
like some Photoshop in here as well.
Like if you're in the business of
creating a leak or a fake leak, you can
uh you can do all sorts of funny things.
Um there was a uh what what was it?
There was someone who
what what did they do? They went and
they they filmed something normally and
then they went into After Effects and
they made it look like they were on a
green screen for it and they made fake
behindthe-scenes footage for their real
footage. So it looked like they were
ser. So they actually went surfing and
then they and they and then they made a
a CGI version behind the scenes. Uh just
like that there there's that Apple uh
trailer now for the for the introduction
to uh Apple TV and they say we made it
all uh practically. We did it all
practically. Um let me uh see we need a
uh we need an image for uh uh for our
next guest because we are not doing
video. We are just doing
>> he is semi non but we have growing
Daniel in the reream waiting room. Let's
bring in Growing Daniel into the TV.
>> Growing Daniel, how are you doing?
>> Doing really great. How are you guys
doing?
>> Fantastic.
>> You're doing well. It's great to finally
have you on the show. It only only took
you three invites, but you've been busy
and you finally made it.
>> It's an honor to be here. I didn't I
didn't have anything to say before.
>> I'm glad. Now you do.
>> I'm glad. Yeah.
>> You're launching the moral discernment
company of San Francisco.
>> Getting into moral discernment. Uh
finally I would love to know what that
what that means. Well, like is this is
this is this a vibe shift for on your
part or do you feel like this is a
continuation of your you know affinity
for moral discernment? walk me through
how you evaluate like what is or is not
a good startup idea or like a virtuous
like uh Trace Stevens says that good
quests philosophy like how how do you
think about judging the the work of the
technology industry that we see every
day on display on X
>> I guess it's not really complicated to
me I mean okay so if you're selling like
uh gambling then uh you're basically um
selling drugs to people
>> uh like and everyone knows that right.
Uh I
I didn't think it'd be a big thing to
say, but you should want to build things
that are good for people. And I think
that's exactly what the pope was saying.
Um if you are engaging in the act of
creation, then you should try and create
something that's actually good for
people. And I think over the past uh 10
years, we've had this like really weird,
I guess, school of moral philosophy that
we all collectively call woke.
>> Sure. It's been really dominant and it's
had an extremely aggressive uh priest
class that tries to get every it tries
to coersse everyone into bending the
knee to it. Um and nowadays that's not a
very popular perspective thankfully. I
think that that fever kind of broke. Uh
but I don't think what replaces it is
nothing. I don't think that's a good
solution. I think everyone should want
to should want to help.
>> Actually, you cannot criticize
technology at all. If it's software, you
cannot criticize it. We're banning you
you we're making it illegal to identify
negative externalities of any technology
product.
>> And a lot of this stuff is even
externalities. It's literally just
you're selling drugs to people in terms
of the economic transaction, right? Like
it's the core product. It's not like
somebody got, you know, left fielded
walking down the street by gambling.
It's funny. People people used to be
criticized, you know, 3 years ago it was
like stop building enterprise SAS and
people were like okay I'll build
gambling apps.
>> Yes. Okay. But on the gambling issue uh
walk me through how you think about the
utilitarian calculus of like what is or
is not gambling because uh when I think
about like like putting money in an S&P
500 ETF in an IRA that I hold for 30
years, I don't think of that as
gambling. Um, but then if I'm if if
you're a professional fund manager and
you're managing retirements, like that's
not gambling. There is risk, but then
you go down to like zero day options and
it's starts to look a lot like gambling.
Uh, and so do you believe in this like
moral relativism? Do you think that
there's a clear line, a bright line like
what is or is not gambling these days?
Passive income.
>> I mean I mean yes, sometimes there just
interface with it, but is it is it I is
it I'll know it when I see it.
Uh, I don't even think gambling's wrong,
by the way. Like it's like I think it's
fine to get together with your friends
and play poker on a Sunday or something
like that's totally fine. Um,
uh, so as far as like gambling goes, I'm
I'm saying that if you're going to
dedicate your life to building
something, which is what you do when you
start a company, it's not like you're
just like, you know, doing something as
a hobby. Uh, then what I'm saying is
that you should reflect morally.
>> Yes. if you get like I I don't think I'm
not here to tell you what is right and
wrong. Um but the pope's entire point
was that you should think about that and
try and do good things and uh I didn't
think anyone on earth I guess one person
for sure had a problem with that. Um and
so I I don't have the moral guide book.
Uh there is a guide book. I I uh I own a
copy. It's called the Bible. Yes. Um but
uh I do not I cannot uh you know
extrapolate that to every modern
situation. Um but I do encourage
everyone who's building anything to
think about what they're building. What
good is it? Is it actually helping
people? And by the way B2B SAS doesn't
get me up in the morning but hey that's
honest software that actually you know
solves people's problems. That's a great
thing to build. I think
>> I like that. I like that. Um,
I mean, so le let's get into steel
manning the other side of this because,
uh, that's what's fun. Um,
>> it's okay to it makes for good content.
So, uh, it so it's okay to it's okay to,
you know, hit the casino, the crafts
table like once every couple years, you
know, on a on a vacation or something.
Uh, isn't that what Andre's doing? like
like by by total by net asset value by
the actual deployment of the capital
like 99% of the dollars are going into
honest B2B software data bricks it's
going into things that feel virtuous and
then yes they do have speedrun which is
an incubator and yes within speedrun
there are some crazy crazy companies and
I'll give you that but as a percentage
of the capital that has allocated we are
in the uh Yeah, once a year he goes to
Las Vegas. We're not in the he only
funds gambling. So, how do you react to
that?
>> I think that if you are uh if you're
going to Vegas, uh then you're there's
nothing the whether or not you're
betting black or red is pretty it's it's
an extremely amoral situation. Okay.
>> Um when you come out and you put $15
million into CLI, I think that is not an
amoral situation. you made a decision
there uh about what you want to fund,
what you want to see in the world.
>> Okay.
>> Um and so what I see uh if he if he
wants, you know, and again that's, you
know, obviously A16Z will do what it's
do what it wants, right? Like they don't
have to listen to me. Um but for a lot
of people, I think the CLY investment
was a real moment. At least for a lot of
my founder friends, that was a moment
where it was like, oh, okay, like we're
just literally going to fund whatever
[ __ ] thing now. Um, no matter, you
know, whether or not it's good, uh, it's
just more vibe, more more, you know,
bigger tweets. Come on. And, you know,
just trying to keep this constant, uh,
sense of excitement going. Uh, and for
what? For for this cheating app. Like,
this is stupid. Like, what are we doing?
Um, I didn't come out here to build
cheating apps. I didn't come out here to
build uh gambling apps that advertise
that they can, you know, help people
gamble under the age of 21.
uh like these things do not seem um they
don't seem they don't seem immoral to
me. They seem actually immoral and
that's a decision they're making and I
would encourage them to not make that
decision.
>> Well, the good news is that it does feel
like Cle has pivoted to just B2B SAS I
guess. So maybe maybe it's total victory
victory for for honest sass. Uh I have
one more I have one more steelman that I
Daniel helmet.
>> I should get the helmet out. Although I
don't know. Can you see us or is or can
>> I can see you right now.
>> Okay, good. So, John's going to throw on
the the helmet.
>> The helmet for the second helmet is the
steel
>> second steelman. Uh I was really I was
really hoping it'd be a crusader helmet.
>> Yeah. So, this is the steelman helmet,
which is which is for when you're steel
manning a point. Um and so it's very
hard to wear, but um
>> as it should be.
>> Yes. Uh heavy is the head that wears the
steelman helmet. So the second steel man
is uh is while I agree with you that you
should not mock the pope, you should not
try and dunk on the pope. It's kind of
rude. I I would say that potentially it
is okay to
uh critique the pope for uh trying to
set regulatory frameworks around
business. And I would cite the the Wall
Street Journal's postmortem uh like you
obituary on the previous pope and kind
of look back on some of the stuff that
the pope had done that was uh maybe
leaning too heavily into some of the
environmentalist trends and maybe caused
too much of a shift that actually sort
of hurt the quality of life in Europe
and America and uh and it was not it it
wound up being incomp compatible with
human flourishing. And so the pope is
maybe not always correct. And so there
does need to be some level of dialogue
between even Catholics and the Pope.
>> John, did you just say the Pope isn't
always correct?
>> I'm saying I have the Steelman Hamlet on
for a reason.
>> Yeah, of course you could say that. Of
course that's a totally You don't even
have to wear the helmet. It's a totally
reasonable take. Of course, the pope's
going to say things that are incorrect
and especially I think on uh temporal
issues on on political issues. Um the uh
the Pope does not just raise supreme. We
can't disagree with them. Um I do I do
think that if the pope makes a very like
you know anodine and earnest post about
how we should care about the things that
we're building and the effect it has on
people, uh then you shouldn't mock them.
Yes. I think I especially especially I
mean if you're some you know lobby
that's whatever but if if you're Mark
and come on man. Um so I guess seeing it
from him I was like that bothered me but
no absolutely uh obviously I disagree uh
with you know probably many things the
pope believes on on political issues.
>> Sure. Uh we do have a question from the
chat. Why is the pope above being
mocked? I we touched on this but is it
just is it just purely respect? Do you
think all people should avoid mocking
the pope or specifically Catholics,
specifically religious people,
specifically Americans? Is there any
more nuance to who gets to mock? It
sounds like lobies maybe could mock the
Pope if they're, you know, some sort of
a non silly young growing Daniel. Young
growing there's a young growing the
future growing Daniel.
>> Would would you have mocked the pope two
years ago? Probably.
Um
>> I think I think my my view is just is
not to interrupt but I'm guessing you
agree
>> just like it it should be okay to
>> expect like the technology industry
broadly has so much power. It impacts
our lives in so many different ways
>> that people within the industry should
criticize it. People outside the
industry should criticize it. We should
we should expect that people understand
the weight of their work even if it's
not in defense tech or national security
related etc. Like the work
impacts our lives and it impacts people
that are outside the industry and to
basically I don't even know I mean part
part of this is like this was such a new
meme format I was trying to clock like
okay what does he actually mean by this?
This is like this is like a
>> he was so bad at applying it. Did you
watch the full interview, the GQ Sydney
Sweeney interview?
It was very interesting because it was
an interview for uh an event that GQ
holds that's called men of the year and
it and and it was an interview between
two women and so I I I I think that they
have like genericized the term but they
stuck with giving an award for men of
the year and then they give it to
whoever or something something like it
was very confusing branding for me.
Can't say man.
>> But then uh but then also like there was
a very weird uh it felt like a little
bit of a roar shock test actually
watching the interview because when I
actually went and watched the YouTube
video, it feels like they're having a
ton of fun with each other for like 10
minutes and then they do get into that
one question that's kind of sharp
sharply worded and she kind of dismisses
and says like look I'm not
>> Why would you even try to understand the
source material, John? It's just a meme.
>> I I I get it. I don't know. No, that
that was that was part of my like uh you
know Mark Mark applied it in a bunch of
different ways in a very short period of
time, right? So it's he was he was a
little trigger happy with it.
>> I don't know.
>> Oh well.
>> I think I think Mark got excited that he
thought there was a new image that you
could quote tweet someone with and it
would just own them every time. and he
wanted to go apply that in as many
places as possible before the cool
points ran out because of people like
Mark applying it and and running down
the cool clock. So, he wanted to get as
many of these out as possible and that's
what he was trying to do and I don't
think he understood the source material.
Um, but
>> he paid the price. Yeah,
>> it was. It was definitely Anybody out
there that was thinking about mocking
the pope, I think, is gonna is going to
at least think twice.
>> Yeah, the pope is like level 9,000.
>> Have you been Have you been leveraging
that prayer? We We covered We covered
the prayer uh I I forget which church
it's in exactly, but the prayer
>> Star of the Sea.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Have you leveraged that at all?
>> Oh, I leverage that every week.
Absolutely.
That seems like some some serious alpha
that that should have become the current
thing. There should have been lines at
the door.
>> It's insane that it's available uh for a
50 cent candle. Uh you can go and uh
pray for St. Carlo to intercede for you
who is in heaven by the way hanging out
with God
>> and he will intercede on your behalf for
your technical problems. Incredible.
Incredible. Star of the Sea Parish, San
Francisco, everyone.
>> I could see VCs, you know, actually
putting that in term sheets going
forward. You need to take 50 cents.
>> Who's the patron state of of capital
allocation if it's like I think I'm
going into a down round. I think my I
think my portfolio is about to tank. I
need to pray.
>> What do you think? What do you think
tech is getting right right now?
Anything?
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Uh oh. I think we're in a way better
place. So, I don't know. I came out here
in 2018.
Uh from then till 21 uh most of tech
Twitter was crypto Twitter and that
sucked. Um and so now we're actually
building tools that are useful.
>> Many AI tools are actually legitimately
useful which is a radical change from
when I was out here in those three four
years. Um so I think a lot of things are
going really well in tech right now. Um,
I think that uh AI will continue to
creep into every crevice of uh our
capital structures and our processes
throughout society. Um, I think that's
awesome. I think it's going to save
people a bunch of time. It's going to
make people's lives much better. Um, so
yeah. Uh, I think tech's doing really
great overall right now.
>> Why do you think there's so much
darkness on the timeline?
>> John and I were talking this morning. It
feels like more more infighting than
ever.
>> Close. It feels like it es and flows,
but right now Yeah, it feels like
there's a lot of infighting right now.
>> Infighting like what?
>> I mean, the you and Mark going at it was
pretty much the the pinnacle of
infighting, but it does feel like
there's just generally been like a
little bit more spices. And from my
perspective, it feels like it's because
there are actually questions about like
like is the is are we in a bubble? Is
this about to pop? people are getting
like sort of defensive like oh like
maybe I shouldn't be uh e even if you're
not like like oh I I I have my entire
net worth in this one thing. Uh there's
even just like I don't want to look
stupid for being overly promoting
something that's about to sell off by
20% or 50% or something like that. And
so it just feels like people are in a
little bit more of a defensive posture
online. And I was wondering I don't know
do you feel that or do or do you not
feel that? I don't feel that. The only
thing that I feel is weird lately and
it's in San Francisco and in tech is
that
>> uh it we attracted a lot of like kind of
grifty signaly people
>> and um there's like people messaging me
about how to like you know establish
their image in San Francisco and stuff.
I'm like what are you talking about? I'm
like what are you doing?
Like literally like if you like building
things then come find some guys or
whatever. come find some people that
like building and talk to them and and
if you vibe then you can work on
something, right? Like I don't know.
It's how it always was.
>> And so there's a lot of people that are
like now moving in and trying to like,
you know, get their head shots done like
they're moving to LA and you don't have
to do that. You don't have to do that,
man.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I said earlier I think it
won't be the top until you have founders
doing pitching at demo day and
chromearts and Rick Owens. When that
happens, it's over. Sell sell
everything.
>> Uh
>> I hope the top comes before the end.
>> What is uh what is the correct way to
launch a new startup today?
>> Is it a is it a is it a 90 second vibr?
>> I feel like a lot of stuff played out,
but like is there anything that you
think is like actually the correct way
to do it?
>> Um I think first you should have a
Twitter account with 175,000 followers.
>> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Step for sure. post
until you do that.
>> Yeah, post constantly.
>> No, I uh I don't know. It's different
for everyone. Like that's the thing is
like I don't know. I always hate like
startup advice because it's like
literally everything is different. Like
literally if it were automatable then it
would be uh and so it's like what is
your situation? Like I don't know. Um
but you got to figure out the way in
which you're weird, you know, and uh and
work on that. That's usually your uh
your comparative advantage.
>> Yeah, I like that. I like that. Just
just the advice is like avoid the
templates basically.
>> Do you get any inbound do you get any
inbound customer interest? Like do any
any any uh anybody ever put it together?
>> The least monetized account with
$179,000.
>> I got one
>> one customer shocking to me.
>> Let's ring the we
go.
>> Hell yeah. customer from X.
Congratulations on your one customer.
>> I mean, that's probably
>> it's great.
>> It's one more than I thought I would
get. I uh we won't talk about my
industry here, but I definitely work in
an industry that is um
>> a Twitter industry. Yeah. Um and so, uh
I never expect I really should have
built DevTools or something. I should
have done something wrong. Um but, uh
yeah, so my uh Twitter is not really uh
related to my real life at all. Um, but
yeah, we did get one out of it.
>> I think uh I I think at some point you
could uh just just all the people asking
you for advice uh you know on personal
branding. Just say fine, I made I made a
course. It's $10,000.
>> I I the $10,000 course. The $10,000
course. It's effectively non-dilutive
funding for the company.
>> Yeah, you can do it as a joke.
>> I don't think that would be good for I
don't think it would be good for the
world.
>> That's true.
>> Wouldn't actually make it good. And I
feel like I'm just ripping people off
and I don't want
>> moral discernment strikes again.
>> I am I am the most I am the least
probably except no except Rune uh the
least uh under monetized uh person on
Twitter which is pretty amazing. I see
people with 20,000 working hard so
inspiring brother get out there.
>> Um I will say we have an announcement
>> uh from my real life. Uh the council has
met and we've decided
We are hiring an engineer.
>> Wow.
>> Congratulations.
>> So,
uh, DM growing go on X the it's the
everything app in case you forget which
which app X is. Go and find growing
Daniel and you can send him uh your uh
LinkedIn or your uh your resume. Um, if
you want to live in San Francisco and
you can pass an FBI background check,
both those things have to happen. and
you are a good engineer. Uh then you can
come work with growing data.
>> Every everyon
poster was just qualified.
>> It is never you are the most doxable
person in the world.
>> Thank you for taking the time to come
on.
>> No, we will we protect this.
>> We will protect we protected. We
protected.
>> Thank you guys so much.
>> Very exciting role. Uh, I'm gonna I'm
gonna message some people and say, "Hey,
go go go go go join the moral
discernment company of San Francisco."
>> I respect it on so much. Like I don't
even save like full names in my phone or
anything. The first time the first time
growing Daniel sends me his email for
some reason. Uh, it's just his full full
name in his email. Like just first name,
middle name, last name. Like dude, you
just
>> If I could do it again, if I could do it
again.
>> Thank you guys so much for having me.
Great to see you. Great to see you.
Great to talk to you. I love love love
watching you build and and have fun on
the internet and
>> you know how to do it.
>> We both we both come a long way. I think
we uh we met up at
>> very had a very LA meeting many years
ago. Got together at Arowan. There you
go.
>> I don't remember what we got but uh
>> but uh it's been it's been fun uh to
watch you you build and uh entertain us
all. So I think
>> fantastic.
>> See you guys.
>> See you. Goodbye. Let me tell you about
some honest B2B software. Adio customer
relationship magic. Adio is the AI
native CRM that builds, scales, and
grows your company to the next level.
You can get started for free. We have JD
Ross from with coverage in the Restream
of Openor.
>> Co-founder of Open Door. We're back with
Open Door Week here.
>> How you doing, JD? Good to see you.
>> All right, guys. What's happening?
>> Oh, wow. I love the effect.
>> Sometimes it's uh it's a little bit of a
jump scare getting you into the Ultra
Dome from the Reream waiting room. You
can see you're on display here. Uh, you
got some news for us. What's What's up?
I'd love to ring the gong. First, why
don't you introduce yourself? Why don't
you give us a little bit of background?
>> He says he likes one sound effects.
>> Matt sound effect. You got an America.
You got the bald eagle. Let's hit the
bald eagle. Let's have some
>> bald eagle. I'm in Texas.
>> He's in Texas.
>> There we go. How you doing? What are you
working on these days?
>> Yeah. I I mean, I'm working on honest
B2B software. I'm working on extremely
honest software.
>> Fantastic. I I think uh you know you had
Cass on yesterday by the way talking
about the importance of having like a
leader the right leader in a business
you know he's he's really amazing um
>> that is a hard business like open door
is I think we
>> like we had a core value called we eat
basis points for breakfast
>> and like a basis point is a 100th of a
percent and so you were like fighting
for each edge of a percent to cut off
the cost to make the business good back
in the day um he's obviously a better
operator than I Uh, so I'm working in
the opposite business now. It's an
insurance business where you have like
99% retention and 99% gross margins.
Wow.
>> Um, because I'm I'm lazy and I don't
want to fight anymore. Uh, and it's all
coverage. And basically the background
was a couple years ago, you know, I was
talking to my my buddy Max who's my
co-founder and I was like, look, in
every company I've started or been in,
we've had great like legal counsel. I've
liked my tax council. My insurance guy
and everyone else I know's insurance guy
is kind of an idiot. Like they don't
really know what we do. They don't
really know what is for our business.
Yeah.
>> And so we're like, we could probably do
this better. Um let's just mess around
for a bit and see what we can make
happen. And it's now two years later. We
have uh well over 500 clients, 10
million revenue, profitable the whole
way.
>> There we go. That's great.
what uh
>> profitability not not not something you
see we're going to hit the gong for
profitability.
>> Um real quick before we dive more into
coverage I wanted to ask you about uh
Open Door's new feature. Uh Cass was
talking about uh you know introducing uh
returns to uh home buying. Uh I I think
you could make the case that it would
just increase overall sales velocity if
people knew like hey I can buy this and
if I don't like it I can return it. But
when you talk about eating basis points
for breakfast like you know returns end
up being like a huge like line item or
expense for a lot of companies that sell
uh physical goods. Um but what's your
take? My my view is you always want to
have the right incentives in a business
>> and returns is a good incentive in a
business. Like if you know that you can
be returned, you are going to keep your
quality bar high. You're going to make
sure that you are selling with
integrity, that there's a true value in
the product. And if you can't return it,
you can sell it. You're going to sell as
cheap as you possibly can.
>> This is lemon law. Lemon law in cars,
right? It's like you you don't want to
sell lemons because you you would be
forced to buy the car back if there is a
problem with it.
Exactly. And the same thing for a house.
Right now, everyone's biggest fear when
buying a house is, did I buy a lemon?
Because it's every dollar I probably
have.
>> It's, you know, it's by like 8x the
largest purchase I'm going to make in my
life versus like a car or anything
afterwards.
>> Uh it's scary and you only do it a few
times in your life. And you're kind of
trusting this person you met probably a
month ago to as your adviser who's very
incentivized to get the deal done.
>> And so you want to be able to have that
confidence point. And if you're like,
"Hey, this is going to affect the bottom
line." Well, only if you're selling bad
product. Sell the right place.
>> I had a friend who bought a house who
had gets into it and like a year in
discovers that like it has a bad
foundation and I was like that sounds
like a catastrophic loss of that house.
Like
>> of the house you want to have a bad
issue.
>> Exactly. It's like if if the if the if
the chimney on the top protects
>> Okay. Just pick up the whole house,
we'll fix a foundation.
>> Fixing the roof feels way easier than
the than the foundation.
>> Yeah. Just just get under there.
>> Yeah. Uh so so what what are what what
are your clients actually looking for on
the insurance side? Uh I mean we have a
variety of insuranceances here. Is it
all one deal? Like uh does it get
crazier as the as the companies get
bigger and bigger and bigger? um how we
had we had an experience getting
insurance for uh TVPN
>> that I couldn't tell you how many times
>> they would come back for a new signature
and I was like I've signed I've signed
for this insurance like six times now
it's like oh there's another doc you
missed you you didn't do this one doc
and I'm like oh well
>> didn't know this doc was coming
>> in one dock put all the docs in one dock
>> you didn't know about this doc or the
last one or the last one or the last one
I got to keep signing uh So
>> yeah.
>> So I I think the way first of all the
the hardest part of our business by far
is just getting the first call
>> because it's something no one wants to
care about. Unless you're talking about
our our insurance clients in
construction where it's a huge deal for
them.
>> Uh most clients it's just like just get
the first call. Once we have that
they're like oh wait this is much much
better. It's like ramp before you know
versus any expense management system you
had in the past. No one was thinking
about changing out the expense
management system. But then once you
have a much better risk management
system in our case now your entire life
as sort of a CFO or you know GC gets a
lot easier because this whole thing that
you know is very important and are very
afraid of but don't understand is taken
care of. And so our view is we replace
the traditional broker with a tech
platform. uh we pair them with an
industry expert who's basically your
fractional risk manager. And instead of
commissions, we try to align the
incentives with a fee so that our job is
to save them money instead of making
them spend more money year-over-year.
>> And those three things, the platform,
the plan, and the team driving savings
has generally worked really well. And
the types of insurance depends on who
we're talking to, right? like for a
restaurant and or a manufacturing
company or like a next generation
defense manufacturer, it's workers
compensation. Typically, there's
contractual risk. Um, if you're talking
about fintech, it's like cyber insurance
and errors and omissions and things like
that. Uh, for tech company, it's usually
DNO and then benefits. And so, our job
is just like build a point solution at
each stage of this. Software has gotten
so much easier to build than years ago,
right? AI makes it so you can just you
can launch new features when you have
the right foundation. It's not cracked
and you don't have to return it a few
years later. Uh when you have the right
foundation as a business, you can build
these things much easier now than you
could in the past. And our clients
really like they get a lot of value from
that.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh
>> have you thought about buying existing
insurance agencies? I've heard I've
heard uh I heard at least one company
that uh a portfolio company of a of a
fund M&LP in.
>> It's just a hot trend right now with the
AI thing is like pull forward by your
investors legacy thing. JD, it'd be
great if you could figure out us a way
for us to give you another $50 million.
I do not like how profitable you are.
This is a big problem for us.
>> Yeah, literally. I think that's part of
it. I think people are chasing
opportunities with dollars before
understanding the opportunities.
>> Sure. Look, insurance is a very like
inquisitive space these brokerages
because it's been the only way to grow.
I think we might be the only one I know
of who's doing purely organic growth
where you're saying, "Hey,
>> you know that guy you golf with every
weekend? Forget him. Come on over to
us."
>> And having that work and I think it's
because the whole industry is broken.
Like everyone kind of feels fleeced by
their guy.
>> Uh but no one in that space actually
wants to innovate because they're it's
the most one it's the most boring
industry on earth. like no one wants to
talk about this or think about it. Even
if it's your job, you generally don't
want to think about it. And now with AI,
it's finally like right for disruption
on a platform side. But if you're
acquiring brokerages, you have to
convince this 50-year-old
golfer, whatever to change their
operations. Like, no way.
>> Uh I noticed you don't have the words AI
agents anywhere on your website.
>> Is that intentional?
>> Even had a website until like a month
ago.
>> Yeah. Yeah. But no, no, but it feel but
it feels intentional where there like
other people building this business
would say would have would be selling
this as like we're bu we're building AI
agents for finding and insurance and
risk management. But it feels like
businesses don't really care. They're
not used to using agents that are
awesome yet. And so that's not really a
selling point. I'm curious how you think
about how software is evolving and how
you think about like integrating AI for
the user as well as kind of back office
and actually to to deliver value.
>> Definitely I I think right now the
storyline for AI on the foundation model
side is really obvious, right? It's just
increasing general capabilities and I
think the AI software pure kind of play
where you're just saying hey we're
selling AI into businesses to make them
more efficient
isn't working as well as people want in
certain areas it's really going gang
busters like engineering um software
engineering others it's and content you
know generation things like that in
others it's just not performing as well
our view is that you it's much easier to
build an AI native business than it is
to build the software and sell it into
people who don't know how to even adopt
this stuff yet. Um, over time, I think
maybe it'll get easier as the the uh the
entry points make sense in each of these
businesses, but it's very experimental
right now.
>> And so, we're very very focused on from
the ground up, how do we build a
business where it works from an AI
native way, right? Like where our
clients can just say, "Okay, I'm buying
something I already understand." And
behind the scenes, yeah, when you
request a certificate of insurance, an
AI agent does that, right? It reads
through this 200page PDF and says, "Are
you qualified to get this data or not?"
Okay, great. We're going to email your
insurance carrier, blah blah blah, and
it comes back and works to the customer.
It's just magic. They just get what they
want. They don't need to know how. Like,
it's like explaining. You don't want to
know where the the sausage meat comes
from. You just want to get your sausage.
>> Last question. Do you have any mattress
companies that you're working with?
>> We work with this incredible business
called Eight Sleep.
>> Let's go. That's my next ad read. Thank
you so much for coming on the show. I'm
going to transform.
>> Amazing uh setup. Well, you're you're
our new uh insurance correspondent, so
anytime there's some hard-hitting
>> insurance news, just a risk guy.
>> Risk guy.
>> Whatever just call me in.
>> Yeah. Uh
>> uh if something I mean careful what you
wish for.
>> I mean the big the big question actually
is uh is is the like the how how uh like
who is it? Deutsche Bank is like
creating insurance products around the
AI data center leases to try and hedge
the risk there. That's a fascinating
story, but we'll have to jump into it
another time because we're we're running
late. But thank you so much for coming.
>> Great to finally have you on and come
back on anytime.
>> Yeah, we'll talk to you soon.
>> Have a great
>> How did you sleep last night, Jordy? I
got a 76.
>> I still am away from my eight. Oh, yes.
>> I gotta move it over. Um I'm I'm
fighting against myself then. Uh let's
get to Tyler's cam. Just check in with
Tyler. Oh, what? What? What happened to
your Oh, oh, what happened here?
>> Oh, you can't see it. You can't see your
desk.
>> He He He backed down. He backed. You can
see that the c the microphone is moving
upwards because he he uh lost the
strength to stand at his standing desk
and put his standing desk down.
>> I didn't lose the strength.
>> You lost the strength. You
>> I like to move around. Sometimes I like
to sit down. Okay. Well, you can sit
down then. That's No problem. No
problem. Our next guest is Josie Zer uh
who is uh building a literal unicorn
>> using DNA editing to
>> I will be right back
>> to modify horses. Is this correct? I
mean welcome to the show. How are you
doing? Good to see you.
>> Hey, what's up John? How's it going?
Yeah, I mean we're gene editing animals.
I think animals are kind of like the,
you know, software of reality.
>> Fantastic.
>> And uh
>> software of reality. What a turn of
phrase. I love it. Uh what like what
does this actually mean? Uh is it
>> I know. Especially nowadays with all
these people.
>> Sorry, there's a little bit of a delay.
>> No, it's not theoretical. Here's the
thing. Yeah, I know.
>> Okay.
>> Where am I? I'm in my lab in Austin,
Texas.
>> Oh, fine.
>> Doing is the delay still there? Can we
go?
>> Yes, it is. uh why don't you give me uh
an introduction on the company kind of
where you are and I'd love to know uh
how what your actual timeline is for
building this actual you literal unicorn
that going through
>> yeah so you know the company I run is
called Embryo Core and we're working on
gene editing animals I'm kind of just
like I'm tired of people investing in AI
note-taking apps And I look at
universities and how science isn't going
forward. So I'm like, [ __ ] it. I'm going
to build a startup company that people
actually care about and like and I'm
going to science that I can invest my
blood, sweat, and tears in. And to me,
that's gene editing the future of life,
you know.
>> Amazing. Uh I think we have some Is
there anything we can do about the delay
or or should we come back to this? I I
think we might need to have you back on
the show another time. The that the
delay is just a little crazy right now.
Um but uh uh but I'm I'm glad we got to
check in a little bit and talk about the
story somewhat. Uh I'm sorry we couldn't
get it figured out. Somehow we can edit
animals DNA and yet we can't get the the
the Wi-Fi to work. It happens. Um but
the chat is loving you and uh they're
they're very excited about this. Uh but
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we uh that we
ran into technical difficulties, but we
will check in with you soon. Have a good
rest of your day. We'll talk to you
soon. Um let's bring in our next guest
after I tell you about public.com
investing for those that take it
seriously. They got multiasset investing
industryleading yields and they're
trusted by millions. Our next guest is
Scott Shapiro from Coinbase. Let's bring
him in from the reream waiting room into
the TBP Ultradom. Scott, how are you
doing?
>> Great. How are you guys?
>> We're doing fantastic. a little uh
recovering from some technical
difficulties, but hopefully there
haven't been any technical difficulties
in your life recently. Uh give us the
update. What uh what what is the latest
news in your world?
>> Probably our token sales announcement
from yesterday morning.
>> I think that was in the Wall Street
Journal. Correct. Can you give me Can
you give me the full story
>> guys got in the journal the sacred text?
>> I I think so. is is Coinbase launches
site for so for token sales. Blockchain
startup Monad will be the first to sell
its digital coin on the new platform.
Coinbase Global is launching a new
platform to allow individual investors
to purchase digital tokens before they
are listed on its exchange. You tell me,
is this fake news or is this the truth?
>> That is probably the realest news in the
whole journal yesterday. We are for the
first time bringing token sales to the
full US retail community since 2018.
>> That's fantastic. Okay. So, yeah, break
down the different levels because I know
you guys just acquired Echo. That serves
a different use case, but what what are
the different types of offerings?
>> Yeah, you know, we're trying to go full
life cycle when we think about asset
issuers, right? We have a great
exchange. It's been around for a long
time for secondary trading, but we
announced yesterday introduces primary
issuance right before it starts trading
on the secondary market. Echo and a
related company, Sonar were acquired by
Coinbase a couple weeks ago.
Coincidental, we were playing this token
sales product working with Monet
already. That is even further upstream
what Echo is doing kind of pre-sales
before a token is even ready to be
traded or used.
>> Awesome. So, so this new product you
could compare to uh uh certain you know
companies like Robin Hood and Public
will take an allocation in different
IPOs and give an allocation to everyday
investors, people that are
non-investment banks or sort of
established uh investment firms. Is that
like a good comp?
>> It's a it's a fair comp. I'd say the two
biggest differences these are not IPOs.
These are token sales. Purely crypto, no
stock exchange involved.
Second difference is it is only
distributed to retail investors on
Coinbase. So there's not a little IPO
allocation for retail and then a big
allocation for institutions. This is
100% just focused on a sale to the
retail community and then post sale the
real float that comes will be from these
folks who bought uh tokens on Coinbase
in that primary sale.
>> That makes sense. uh what uh why why was
now the right time to bring something
like this to market? I know I mean if
you look back through the history of
crypto, there was an era where these
kind of offerings to retail were much
more popular and then there was a lot of
pro you know kind of like problems and
regulatory gray area from that uh time
that uh is starting I feel like to be a
bit more clarified but you know maybe
you could talk about the timing.
>> Yeah, there's a couple things here. One
is just our ambitions have gotten much
broader in terms of becoming what we
call the everything exchange. So being
able to offer every asset class at every
stage of its development and what I
focus on is really making that tailor
made for the retail community all around
the world. Second thing is the
regulatory environment is much better.
And so where a company like Coinbase was
being uh not not so favorably looked
upon by the SEC a couple years ago um
that regulatory environment has improved
to the degree where we feel much more
comfortable offering this type of
product not just to the US community but
in dozens of other countries around the
world and that's a really new thing uh
for crypto.
>> Yeah, it makes sense. Uh what about uh
what do you expect the volume of
offerings to look like? Monad is is
going to be the first. Is this something
that's happening on a on a weekly basis?
You know, monthly basis. What are the
plans there? What can you share?
>> Probably more like monthly than weekly.
We're really not trying to maximize
volume. This is definitely a quality
over quantity play. So it really depends
on the types of issuers and the depth of
those teams involvement and really their
willingness to do this in a way like the
Monad team has agreed to where they're
not just going to turn around and sell
all of the you know insider allocations
right away but they're looking to
develop long-term incentives and hold
themselves to a standard of longerterm
lockups and longerterm vesting schedules
uh that really puts control in the hands
of the retail investors. uh and you know
you look in the past a lot of these
token sales on backwater types of
markets have not done that um and so we
think that if issuers are willing to do
that we'll we'll engage with them.
>> How does how does pricing work? Is it is
it a function of supply and demand or is
an issuer you know setting a valuation
uh and and a specific allocation amount
like what can you say around that front?
>> It's it's exactly the latter we
described. So the issuer sets the token
price, they set the allocation to uh
what goes in into this primary sale. Uh
we make sure that it's a team of high
quality and that they're willing to be
transparent about their unlocks
investing schedules and that they're
really committed for the long term. Um
and then it's really up to the retail
audience. They can invest as little as
$100 um or six figures uh paid in USDC,
of course, stable coins uh to be
involved in the sale.
If I'm doing if if I'm starting to sell
tokens through this through through this
process, uh are there like ad units
around this? Like we when we go to an
IPO in New York, we'll often see uh taxi
cabs will be wrapped with we were at the
Clara IPO for example, there were pink
taxi cabs everywhere. At Figma, they
really like went all out. There was like
a DJ outside. there was a lot of
celebration big uh like you know massive
canvas that gets hoisted and there's a
lot of attention that comes to it and
the New York Stock Exchange and the
NASDAQ too to some extent uh sort of
offer effectively like marketing
packages to celebrate the moment. Uh is
that something that you'll have like an
analogy to in the digital realm at some
point?
>> I love that idea. I I worked in ads for
a decade uh in Silicon Valley before
coming to Coinbase. Follow my crypto
passions.
>> Thank you. Honestly, powers modern
American economy.
>> Yeah, Cheryl Cheryl Sanberg used to say,
"It's the Lord's work."
>> It is the Lord's work.
>> Back in Facebook,
>> finally,
>> um, we do not have that today. I think
that's an interesting idea. This is
something that if you go to the Coinbase
app, you will see it pretty prominently.
And right now, so the sale actually
starts on the 17th. Right now is the
time when people can come learn about it
and get reminded so that we can notify
them. Um, but there's no paid media
involved and that's something that we
might consider longer term.
>> Uh,
>> I think that'd be fun.
>> What uh has any details released on on
pricing?
>> Yeah, the price is 2.5 cents per token.
>> Um, the FD FTV, the fully diluted
valuation is 2 and a half billion. So,
you can do the math on the number of
tokens out there. Um, the allocation to
Coinbase is $187.5
million uh worth of monad tokens. And
again, that will represent the bulk of
the float uh once it's tradable. So, the
actual market cap that's floating is
going to be a small fraction of the
total long-term fully diluted valuation.
>> Fascinating.
>> That makes sense. Uh well, very very
interesting new product and uh I'm sure
uh hopefully we can get the the Monad
team on uh as we get closer to them to
learn about uh the protocol and what
they're working on.
>> Yeah, that'd be awesome. Thank you so
much.
>> Thank you guys.
>> Have a great rest of your day.
>> Thanks, Scott.
>> Cheers.

>> We're cooking. We're cooking.
>> We've heard your complaints. Not enough
TVPN billboards. Haven't seen one in a
while.
>> We The funny thing is we actually have
been getting that complaint. Very silly.
Uh we have Lawrence Allen from Tteranova
in the reream waiting room. Let's bring
him in into the TVPN Ultra Done.
Lawrence,
>> what's happening? Look at that. Look at
that flag. Look at that. The flag, the
suit. Wow. Royal flag. Isaiah looked so
dapper yesterday. I I figured I had to
put a suit on.
>> You look fantastic. Give us the news and
then I want to go into what the
>> Florida ceiling flag.
>> Yeah, this is it's amazing. This is a
great time.
>> So, some of these flags are just too
small, you know? It's like hard to even
tell if they're they're real or not.
American flag.
>> I'll I'll let you in on a secret. If you
want to win the game for the biggest
flag, you got to put it outside. Go on
the roof. Everyone's putting the flag
inside the factory. If you hang the flag
outside the factory, uh also the world's
biggest flag, they they bring it out at
uh like the halftime of the Super Bowl
every once in a while. There's one of
them. It's like the huge And you can get
it for like 500K.
>> Only 500K.
>> It's not that much, right? If you if you
got 7 million,
>> I mean, it's a lot of money, but it's a
lot of flag.
>> It's a lot of money, but it's a lot of
flag. Anyway, sorry. Uh, it's great to
have you. Great to have you on the show.
>> Weirdest.
>> Weirdest office ever. And the the
outside of the part that's my bedroom is
painted rainbow. So, I was thinking we
just repainted American flag.
>> Okay, there you go. So, you sleeping in
the office, too.
>> Absolutely. You know, it's I think it's
becoming the standard.
>> Where Gundo?
>> We are not. We're We're in Berkeley.
>> Cool.
>> The flag would be a little smaller in
Gundo because the the price is like 320
a square foot there.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Great. bringing American dynamism to
Berkeley,
>> going on the offensive behind enemy
lines.
>> Um, uh, anyways, great to have you on
the show. Congratulations on the launch
yesterday. Uh, breakdown, maybe give
some background on yourself and then
let's talk about the company.
>> Yeah,
>> sure. Yeah, I'm a recent Berkeley grad,
dropped out of Stanford grad school. Um,
I worked at SpaceX before and I am CEO
of Teranova. So, we just launched out of
stealth. We probably had the longest
stealth mode you've seen. And we
>> How long the the There are companies
that have been in stealth for like a
decade.
>> Longer than you've been alive.
>> Maybe not the longest you've seen.
>> I mean, humane humane humane humane I've
been in stealth for like seven years.
>> Yeah. How how long? A couple years.
>> I've been working on this since I was at
SpaceX, which is like late 2021. So, I
was in school until under a year ago at
Berkeley.
>> I stay corrected. Serious stealth mode.
>> Serious stealth mode.
>> Serious stealth mode. Yeah. So, we're
we're we're officially out. Um, proud to
announce our $7 million seed round led
by Congruent.
>> Great hit. Great hit.
>> Congratulations. I was excited for that
one.
>> And Outlander as well.
>> Fantastic.
>> Awesome.
>> Yeah. Who funded Valor and also
Ponderosa and Gothams?
>> Uh, very very cool. What? Uh, so what
are you working on?
Yeah, we're building terraforming
robots. So, usually when you hear about
terraforming, it's some in the sky stuff
like what Augustus is working on at Rain
Maker. Here, we're talking about very
physical on Earth terraforming where we
are lifting land physically out of flood
zones. I think this launch video
captures it very well. Um, but we're
basically injecting really, really large
amounts of material underground to just
directly lift land. So this would be
really useful for you if you are
currently in a coastal area. I think
lots of places all over LA, even parts
of Gundo have this issue uh where you
were just too low. Long Beach was called
the sinking city for years and the
reason is because it just sunk about 10
or or 20 feet due to subsidance and from
that subsidance you have flooding. So
it's not just sea level rise, it's
usually petroleum extraction or
groundwater extraction or being built on
fill. So cities all over the world are
facing this issue and there's just
really not much you can do about it. You
already have the infrastructure in
place. What do you do? You know, there's
no way to lift that infrastructure up.
You can't put it on some little stilts
like you can do a small, you know,
singlestory house. You can put a giant
seaw wall in. Usually you're looking at
hundreds of millions of dollars for
things like that. Sometimes levy systems
will work, but usually what's happening
now is they're just demolishing the
infrastructure, putting a ton of filter
on it, waiting, you know, a year, year
and a half for it to compact and and
moving around dirt on the surface to
make that happen. And then they're
rebuilding that infrastructure. And so,
you know, maybe that's fine if you have,
you know, some inexpensive property, but
we're talking highways. These are, you
know, 8 billion projects for Highway 37,
which is, you know, a few miles north of
here. You're talking about mass
displacements when you're doing this to
whole cities. I'm from Sanfell. We are
facing this problem. Sanfell has about
60,000 people and they're facing a 500
to900 million bill for the seaw wall
system that they need. There's just no
way they can afford that. And so we took
a a super first principles approach. How
could we save our hometown? And this is
what we came up with. So you're
injecting dirt and rock into the ground
in order to uh uh effectively move uh
move move like an area uh or a facility
or a town uh higher. How much uh how
much dirt how much mass do you need to
do that effectively?
>> Yeah, you wouldn't believe it, but dirt
is actually way more expensive than what
we're using. We're using wood. So wood
chips are free delivered in whatever
category you want. Um you can get this
anywhere in the world. It's abundant.
It's usually free delivered because it's
such a large waste product. And so we're
taking this wood chip slurry, pumping it
directly underground. It compacts in
about 2 hours to pretty much the full
consolidation. And then you would just 3
ft higher or whatever you wanted to be
at the end of the day.
It's hard to wrap my head around how
much wood chips you need to raise a city
in height. Uh, but our shipping
container is sized to process 20
semi-truck loads of wood a day.
>> So, we're basically moving 20 semi
truckloads of wood chips through our
system. We have a bunch of robots that
run around the site that deliver that
final fluid underground and then that
processing unit that we call our arc. So
the Prometheus system, that's the the
robot, we call it that because it's
bringing something fundamentally new to
the world, is delivering that final
injection pressure. And you're basically
just moving as much material as possible
underground because really what you need
is volume, not, you know, mass or
something like like you would expect.
>> Uh these wood chips, what what is the
primary source? This is a waste product.
when people are getting trees removed
from properties, manufacturing
processes, where where does it actually
come from?
>> Lots of sources. You know, if we were
going to do the Santafell project, for
example, uh there's a place called Marin
Sanitary right across the street from
the place that floods the most. They
ship eight semi-truck loads a day of
wood chips to be burnt in biomass energy
plants, which are subsidized by the
state because they're non-economic. and
they would way prefer to instead of, you
know, polluting the air up in Stockton
to just pump that right underground. So,
you can get it locally. You can also get
it from sawmills, you can get it from um
fire trimmings all over the state.
Obviously, we have huge fire issues here
in California and so they're doing
massive clearing of of forest and then
they really just don't have anything to
do with that wood.
>> Okay. So, goal is to save San Rafale or
save them from this, you know, massive
uh infrastructure bill. How do you start
small and prove that the company can you
know execute on this type of operation?
Are there specific sites that are uh you
know much smaller scale where you can
kind of start uh proving out uh the the
thesis?
>> Yeah. So I I just got this text from our
team. They are all at our pallet site
right now uh doing some drilling, doing
some pumping. Um you can see we use like
augur drill bits and uh you know big
injection machines to do our our pumping
and have our shipping containers. So we
are deployed this works. We've been
doing this for about a year and we are
looking for more commercial projects to
do right now.
>> So what site what site are they on
specifically? Is that like a testing
ground?
>> They're undisclosed site near Sacramento
um that is primarily a testing ground
but they also have huge drainage and
subsidance issues that we are are
fixing. Huh. Fascinating.
>> Wild. So, so what what are what what's
like the the dream customer right now?
>> Yeah, we would love to do strangely some
wetland restoration projects and also
some new home development projects. So,
things that don't already have a lot of
infrastructure in place are very ideal.
Uh we've seen a customer willingness to
pay slightly higher there because their
risk appetite is a little more because
there's there's not much to go wrong. Uh
we feel ready to do some roadway
projects as well. Sorry, break that
first one down. It's basically like I
have a bunch of land that's undeveloped.
I'm thinking about putting a bunch of
houses on it, but there's a problem
because there's like a marsh in the
middle of it and you can kind of get rid
of the marsh. Is that roughly correct?
>> Not quite. So, in the bay, it's usually
you've dyed or levied off an area and
then because it's organic, it's
subsided.
>> So, there's an example. It's an 80acre
parcel uh right on the water infell near
the target. This has subsided 2 m. And
so because of that, if you were to break
the dyke, it'd be under sea level, of
course. And so they want to do two
things. They want to put some wetland on
that. To do that, you have to lift it so
it can become title. And they also want
to put um about $100 million worth of
homes on that property on the more
upland section.
>> And so that you would also need to lift
it because that section is also too low.
So both are fixed by the same solution
which is ours which is just directly
lift it and make it so you can develop
it and make it into higher quality
wetland.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes a ton of
sense.
>> Uh how long until you have uh you're
getting death threats from conspiracy
theories.
>> Yeah. Modifying the world easy.
>> Yeah. People, you know, obviously
Augustus has been on the show.
>> You're going to get blamed for
earthquakes. That's what's going to
happen. Like there's going to be an
earthquake.
>> We actually think we're going to help
with earthquakes as well. We haven't
been publicly claiming this cuz we're
still doing testing. But this performed
dramatically better. Um, this
underground looks very much like
particle board. It doesn't look like
wood chips. It's compact. And so this is
better than normal earth.
>> Uh, this is very controllable. It's very
physical.
>> Get ready to go on info wars, buddy.
Because I I no matter what the science
says, you are going to get blamed for uh
for earthquakes because people are just
going to be like they were doing
something and then the earthquake
happened. you have you have Augustus as
as as a as a model. Augustus, you know,
was was in the hot seat,
>> but he's done a great job. And I think
that there is a path for communicating
with all constituents, not just tech,
not just Twitter. Augustus has done a
great job getting to, you know, AM radio
listeners and and random uh random shows
that uh do not break through in tech
Twitter. He's done a great job there. Uh
but yeah, communication across all the
constituents has to be really important
for this business. But
>> yeah, I think it's important to say this
is not like a blue state solution. This
is very much red and blue. Totally. We
pitch this all over Florida. Of course,
Miami faces some of the worst flooding
issues. And this is also not just a US
problem. This is something that's
happening all over the world. Uh
Southeast Asia is particularly bad.
We've had ministers from Indonesia, from
Cambodia come here. They're saying like,
"I'm moving my entire capital city of
Jakarta. Help me." And this is very much
going to be the fundamental way that you
solve large scale flooding problems. And
so I I hope that conspiracy theorists
don't come for us. Um we definitely are
willing to show them what's happening.
You know, this kind of looks like a
black box underground, but actually we
have systems where we can measure this
to like a a 2 millimeter level
precision. And so you can have very good
idea of exactly what's happening.
>> That's amazing.
>> Uh one more question just because I'm
trying to wrap my head around the scale.
How many like you know truckloads or
shipping containers worth of wood chips
would you need to let's say raise a
square mile like uh call it like five
feet.
>> I will do that math for you right now.
Um so let's do
acre to square mile. So basically, you
need 20 truckloads per acref foot, which
is actually much better than fill
because with fill you're
>> an acre an acre foot is an entire one
foot like picture an acre and then one
foot.
>> Okay. So one foot deep, acre wide long.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So um you want
>> uh we're doing math on TV right now. I
got
>> Well, while he's doing the math, let me
tell you about Wander. Find your happy
place. This book a wander with inspiring
views of photography
cleaning a 24/7 concier services
vacation home but better. Uh and you
know maybe in the future your wander
will be on terraformed property. We
might be increasing the number of of
vacation homes.
>> Absolutely. So a square mile lifted by
5T is a lot. Of course you know that.
>> Um this would actually be uh 64,000
truckloads of
>> Let's go. Let's go.
>> However, however, as much as it sounds,
there is
>> way way more than that. just in
California, we could absolutely source
that much. Okay, we looked and it is
very straightforward to source a
thousand semi truckloads a day in the
Bay Area. Um, so that would maybe be a
two-month project if you were really
about your logistics and maybe a
two-year project if you didn't care
quite as much.
>> Okay, fantastic. Well, we're looking
forward. Yeah, you're taking taking
something that people want to get rid of
and saying we'll take it.
>> Yeah, lot of people.
>> Thank you so much for taking the time to
to stop by.
>> This uh fun. The chat was mentioning
you. How how are you guys not talking
about this? And we did we did sort of
miss the the the the announcement, but
we're really happy to have you join and
really appreciate
>> Thank you for having me, John. I've been
watching you since you're making YC
videos instead of tech startup videos.
So,
>> that's amazing.
>> Well, uh well, thanks so much.
>> Well, super exciting. Uh congrats to the
whole team.
>> Good luck. We'll talk to you soon.
>> Talk soon.
>> Uh before we move on, let me tell you
about bezel.getbbezzle.com.
Your bezel concier is available now to
source you any watch on the planet.
Seriously, any watch. And in tariff
news, Switzerland has been making moves.
>> Oh, yes.
>> The luxury watch market might be in
turmoil again. We might need to call get
them on the show again.
>> And Switzerland are working on a deal to
slash the 39% tariffs and try to get
them um to 15%. Uh Rolex got uh Trump a
oneofone desk watch clock
>> that has been photographed on Trump's
desk. Uh and
>> that might win him over.
>> And uh yeah, 101 Rolex and win a lot of
people over.
>> That's pretty cool.
>> Kind of uh
>> uh So,
>> didn't didn't uh Barack Obama get a
Rolex as well? I believe he got some
sort of watch from his secret service
agent. His Secret Service agent probably
might have been an Omega. might have
been a Speed Master, but uh but it
became the watch that he wore. He wasn't
a watch guy. Then one of his Secret
Service guys was like, "You got to wear
this watch." And he did.
>> Yeah.
>> Very cool.
>> Uh did you see this post? Jeff Davies in
2016. A lot of posts from 2016
uh these days. Jeff Davies in 2016 said
Apple should buy Nvidia and lock up VR,
AI, and autonomous car tech for the next
decade. Look back 10 10 years from now
and great use of cash. And Apple would
be a uh
>> a10 trillion dollar company
>> basically.
>> Wow. Wild. Uh looking also back this uh
Fireflies. Is this AI noteaker? Someone
was talking trash about AI noteakers
today on the stream. Uh I I I don't even
remember who at this point, but uh so
Shiel Monot says, "This is wild. It's
about a screenshot of a LinkedIn post by
Sam Udotong, who's the co-founder and
CTO at Fireflies AI. This is an AI
note-taking startup. I think they're
doing very well. I think they've raised
money recently. Um, and uh, and they
say, "Came across this post on LinkedIn.
Turns out the first version of
Fireflyy's AI uh, the AI meeting
assistant doesn't even have AI. It's
just founder joining the calls, taking
notes manually, and sending a summary
back. Sounds crazy." Uh, and that is
exactly what Sam wrote on LinkedIn 10
hours ago when this screenshot was
taken. said, "We scaled Flyerflies to a1
billion dollar valuation after six
failures from our original crypto food
idea, food delivery idea." Um, that's
hilarious. Uh,
>> if you're if you're working on a crypto
food idea, pivot to AI noteaker, get to
a get to a billion dollars, uh, uh, a
billion dollar valuation. And so, uh, he
says, this is the key segment. When when
when customers scheduled a meeting, we'd
manually dial in as Fred from
Fireflies.ai. We'd sit there silently
taking detailed notes and send them 10
minutes later after taking notes for a
100 plus meetings and falling asleep in
many. We were finally able to make
enough money to pay the $750 per month
rent for a tiny SF living room. That was
the point where we said, "Let's stop and
automate everything." And so this is
being put in this is being put in like a
dunk because they're saying like, "Oh,
this billion dollar AI note-taking
company doesn't use AI." It's like,
yeah, this was in 2015 or 2016. Like I
actually I actually knew Sam at the time
and I DM'd with him. I was a customer
and I was completely fine with this
because I was like this is awesome. I
get somebody to take my notes for me.
It's basically like an outsource
noteaker. Um but it's being sort of like
reframed as like as like this is what
how they would do stuff now. And it's
like no obviously it's been a decade
almost since they did.
>> Yeah. I think if you're a customer and
you didn't know, you have the right to
be frustrated that you were just
inviting a human and no no uh
>> hilarious hilariously scrappy.
Hilariously scrappy. But yes, they they
were
>> and as long as they were being
transparent with the VCs at that time
that yeah, we're just using couple guys
to do this.
>> It's so crazy looking back on this uh
this conversation with Sam in my DMs.
Uh, and he just says like, "Hey, uh,
like I'm working on I I needed notes
from something. Like, can you uh can you
send in, uh, and transcribe everything?
I've been using Rev, this, uh, this this
manual transcription service that would
take an audio file and just give you a
text text file back, but it was done by
humans." Um, and so here he says, "You
can add Fred at Fireflies to the
calendar invite and Fred will join."
>> Give it up for Fred.
>> Let's give it up for Fred. I was like
just I I was like hey just got my grow
first transcript pretty solid like and
he's like how would you com how
comparable would you say it is to rev
lots and ums and captured uh I I I know
the exact comparison in a day because I
sent the recording to Rev earlier so I
was doing like AB testing actually
seeing like what was what was useful
what wasn't. It was just funny like
actually seeing this company grow so
much and having been an early adopter
and then uh and then see people get the
story wrong. So, you know what? If
you're using Firefly, of course they're
using Whisper. Why would they be using
humans still? It makes no sense. The
technology is good. Uh,
>> um, Tim Sweeney is landmaxing.
>> Oh, what?
>> And behind Fortnite has bought over
40,000 acres of US wilderness not to
build to keep it forever wild.
>> Forever wild. I love it. Where else are
you in the in the timeline? Are you deep
in there?
>> Uh, Mr. Beast says 2% of human time is
now spent on YouTube. M Well, thank you
to everyone who's been spending at least
>> We spend way more than We spend way more
than that.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> Because we're doing like 15 easily 15 15
to 20 hours a week. Oh, yeah.
>> 50 weeks a year.
>> And uh you know, that's we're we're
getting the goal should be to get into
the double digits, right? Somewhere
around
>> somewhere around seven or eight% now. Um
>> Dean Ball had some uh support for your
take yesterday. He said, "I don't think
you should th just throw del at someone
who's identifying a negative externality
of a new technology. That's not
necessarily decelerationist."
Dean Ball says it's heartening to see
such eminently reasonable takes making
their way into prominent protect new
media. There's something very well or
actually neotrad media uh to be clear,
but he says there's something very old
man about the terms of AI policy debates
and per and perhaps this is because it
has been largely old people who have set
them. When I hear certain arguments
about how we need to let the innovators
innovate and thus cannot bear the
thought of resolving negative
externalities from new technology, it
just sounds retro to me like an old man
dimly remembering things he believes.
Milton Friedman once said, "Whereas
anyone with enough neuroplasticity
remaining to internalize a concept as
alien as AGI can easily see that such
simple frames do not work." Um, Ronda
Santis says, "We might have to see if we
can get Pelosi to run Florida's pension
fund." She's showing, uh, this is pretty
incredible. Generated $133
million of profits and a 16,930%
return.
>> I don't believe that number. That's
16,000%. I mean, I guess this is since
1987. She was probably making money and
adding to it. consistently over that
time. Uh
>> what if she just invested like
>> she just invested once and then
>> I'm I'm very I'm very skeptical of that
second number.
>> You don't believe she could just 10x it
and just 10x that again and then 10x
that again
>> and then 16x that last time. Uh it's
possible, but it's like I don't know. I
I I would just imagine that you're
adding to it every year and you can't
just like take the current net worth and
divide it by the the amount of money
that she had when she started investing,
right? Like uh what is 133?
>> Uh anyways, that is a good place to end
the show. We will be not be getting into
the fifth hour today. So, sorry to
disappoint everyone, but uh tomorrow we
have some uh fun guests. We have uh
Brian uh Halagan, CEO of HubSpot coming
on. Also uh a partner over at Sequoia
and then uh Fay Lee from World Labs.
>> So very excited for all of that and we
hope you have a wonderful uh Veterans
Day uh at home wherever you are and
we'll see you tomorrow.
>> See you tomorrow. Goodbye.
>> Cheers. Thank you.
