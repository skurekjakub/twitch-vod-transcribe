Welcome everyone. Today on the Joseph
Carlson show, Duolingo, the stock that's
on everyone's mind. It's down a
staggering 29% on the day. The stock
price is being obliterated. And why is
that? Well, the stock is obviously being
rerated because investors are now
concerned about its future deceleration
in growth. Now, anytime a highly rated
stock, one that's trading at a higher
multiple, has any concerns with its
growth, investors sell out of the stock.
They rate it much lower. And that's what
we're seeing happen here. So, this is
clearly a rerating event. And this is
something that I have a little bit of
experience with in the past with
Netflix. That was another stock that
concerned investors for a time, and
investors quickly rerated the stock to a
much lower multiple, causing it to fall
75% from the highs. So, given this
situation with Dolingo, what do we do?
Do we sell out of the position? Do we
accept our losses, do some tax loss
harvesting, and move on? Do we hold the
position? Do we buy more and double
down? There's a number of options
available to investors in these
situations. And what investors do in
these specific scenarios, in these exact
situations where a stock like Dualingo
sells off dramatically, what we do now
can in many cases determine your future
returns to a huge extent. So, we'll be
talking about Dualingo and I'll be going
over some of the fundamentals of the
business as well as commentary from the
management. Management held an earnings
call yesterday. that I will admit was
one of my favorite earnings calls ever.
It was incredible to listen to the
vision of this management and I want to
go ahead and highlight some of the
things that the CEO said on this call.
So, we'll be looking at everything.
We'll be looking at the portfolio, the
position sizing, all of the damage being
done by Duolingo. Uh we'll go over all
of it. Now, of course, we have other
news to get to. Google is on the move
again. It's one of the rare stocks that
at least right now is in the green on
this red day. Google is by far my
largest position. It's one that I'm very
proud to have as my largest position
because like I've said many times, I've
never seen so many good things going on
with a single stock. It's incredible.
And this is just one more thing to add
to the list. Google's now rolling out
its most powerful AI chip, taking aim at
Nvidia with custom silicon. This
company's doing it all. It's just doing
it all. We're going to be looking at
Google's advancements. And then finally,
we've already had a fail of the week
this week, but we have a second one. So
that's two fails of the week. And in
this case, it's going to be Chipotle.
Chipotle is struggling. Unit volume is
going down. Customers are frustrated.
And one of the primary reasons is the
inconsistent portion sizes. Sometimes
you get a big burrito, sometimes you get
a small burrito. You never know. It
feels like a gamble going to Chipotle.
And in this episode, I will be fixing
Chipotle. I have the solution. I have
the answer. I can fix this company and
get it back on track. We'll be going
over that fix. So, we have a ton to get
to in this episode, a lot to go over.
We're going to be jumping into all of
it. Just a quick mention before we jump
in. I have launched Qualrim Direct,
meaning that you no longer need to go to
Patreon to sign up for Qualramum and
join the Joseph Carlson Show Discord
community. Now, this is a great value
because you get both qualum.com full
access to it, the entire website, all
the benefits, all the bells and whistles
for 10 bucks a month. And you also get
the Joseph Carlson Show Discord included
with that. So, there's no upsells,
there's no cross-selling, it's all just
one thing. And you can sign up directly
on qualum.com without ever using
Patreon. Now, there's two different
plans. One of them is $10 a month. You
get a free trial, a 7-day free trial.
The other one, if you really love the
service, you can pay $8.25 a month on
average. Build once a year. So, this is
the annual plan. Either way you pay,
it's dirt cheap. We now have above
11,000 users. In the past week alone,
we've had 800 people sign up. So, I
appreciate everyone for trying it out,
and the reviews have been overwhelming.
I mean, it's just it's awesome to hear
people's great experiences with the
product, saying, "This is amazing. I
I've tried it out. It's exactly what
I've been looking for. We're getting a
lot of that." So, I appreciate everybody
and hope you have a good experience with
it. Now, let's go ahead and jump in. The
first thing I want to mention with
Dualingo is we can look at my position
sizing because this isn't just some
stock. This is one that's in my
portfolio. Now, it's in the story fund.
And here we have it. If we look at the
story fund, this is a little bit more of
a an aggressive portfolio, so to speak.
In general, these stocks are more
volatile. They're more aggressive.
They're faster growing. And you'll also
notice a theme that they're almost
always subscription-based companies or
they're data companies. They offer
products that people use for a very long
period of time. So they're not very
transactional companies. These aren't
ones that you have an experience with
once and then you leave. So they're not
like car companies. These are companies
where you live with the product. You use
it all the time. It becomes part of your
daily routine. Think about the fact that
Amazon is a product that is a part of my
life. I I have immense lifetime value
with Amazon. Netflix as well. I think
I'm going to have a membership for the
rest of my life. Same with Google. I use
their products every single day, all
day, all the time. Microsoft, the same
thing. Then we have S&P Global. This one
is a a bit different because it's more
detached, but it is ingrained and
embedded in all of the markets. But then
we have more of this with Dualingo. This
is another stock that despite the
volatility, despite the fact that the
stock price is all over the place, this
is a company that people use all the
time. 50 million people are using this
every single day. 50 million a day and
even more on a monthly basis. Now, the
thing that I want to highlight with
Dualingo before we even get into the
analysis of what's going on and what I
plan on doing is I want to emphasize one
point and that is position size.
Dualingo has always been a small-sized
position and the reasons for that were
intentional. I intentionally put it as a
smaller position because I recognize the
inherent risk and volatility in the
company. It is a small company meaning
that it has higher levels of volatility.
Smaller levels of capital move the stock
more either up or down. that increases
the amount of volatility which in many
cases increases the amount of risk
because when stocks go up 50% or down
50% it can become much more difficult to
hang on to that company. So volatility
was part of the reason that I kept it as
a smaller position. Another reason why
is because the company is less
established than many other positions.
For example, no one can reasonably argue
that Dolingo has a much more proven mo
and proven business model than Google,
Netflix or Amazon. You just can't.
Google, Amazon, and Netflix are just way
more proven stocks. They're more at a
steady state. They're more mature. Now,
Netflix 10 years ago, then you could
argue that they're on par with each
other. Netflix 10 years ago was a bit
more dicey. It was a bit more risky, so
to speak. But that's where Duolingo is
now. It's earlier in its arc. The
probabilities, the outcome distribution
is wider than these other companies.
Now, having said that, I've taken in all
of these risk factors and I assessed
that this stock needed to be a smaller
position and I sized it as a 2%
position. Let's go ahead and just take a
look at how this looks on Qualrum. I can
look at my passive income portfolio and
the story fund or I can look at them
combined. So, let's go ahead and just
take a look at them combined for a
minute. We have here at the top Google.
Google is a 13% position. A lot of that
is growth. Google stock has grown to
$72,000 in gains, not counting dividends
paid. And then the rest of it is
deposits. I've deposited into Google.
I've purchased myself over $100,000 of
Google stock. So, an enormous amount of
money has been spent on Google at all
varying stock prices because I'm so
bullish on this company. But Google's
also grown with 72,000. So, it's roughly
a $172,000
position. Now we also have Amazon 11%,
S&P Global 9% or 10%, Netflix 10%, and
all these companies have made massive
gains. Then we scroll down the list. We
have all these holdings uh 6% 8% 5% 4%
3% for Equifax. Even Texas Roadhouse,
which I sold off half my position, is a
3.2% position right now. Duelingo is
less than a 1% position. Now, that's
partly because it sold off by half the
position. It's down $11,000.
Before this company sold off, it was a
2% position. So, it went from 2%, it's
down 50%, now it's at a 1% position.
Meaning, the total impact on my
portfolio, the NAV of my portfolio was
dinged by 1% because of Dualingo's
underperformance. Now, I'll admit having
a 1% hit to my portfolio is not fun. I
want every single stock I make to be a
successful one. I try hard to make good
investments. So, it's not good. I'm not
celebrating that the stock is down 50%
and that it's a 1% hit to my portfolio.
But the reason that I bring this up is
because it's important to look at
position sizing. A lot of times when we
look at other people's investments, we
just see a list of holdings. But looking
at how much money they have in every
holding is incredibly important. For
example, the total amount that I've put
into Dualingo myself is $20,000. That's
what I've contributed. So, the most that
I can lose on the stock is around
$20,000. Now, with Google, I've
contributed five times that amount. So,
it's a $100,000 contribution to Google.
So, Google's over five times the size of
my contribution to Dualingo. And that
represents my levels of conviction in
these stocks. Now, that shouldn't be
interpreted as me being bearish on
Duelingo, but I just believe that it's
deserving of a smaller amount of
capital. I think that's prudent
investing. And I've highlighted this
before today. This is something that
again I've been saying for months. Three
months ago, I said it's fair to say that
a much smaller market cap, higher
volatility, a thesis more heavily
dependent on continual high growth
rates, and only a partially proven
durable moat are all factors in the
smaller size position for Dualingo
compared to other more established
companies. That's what I wrote on my
Discord a couple months ago when I was
continually asked about why the stock is
such a small position in my portfolio.
So, I've had experience with stocks
dropping. In fact, I've seen rerating
events like this happen before
firsthand. One time with Netflix years
ago, I had Netflix as my top position.
Netflix was a stock that I was so
bullish on, I couldn't even contain my
my excitement about the company. I made
video after video about the stock. You
can go back and look at this very
channel. Look at around 2020, 2021,
2022. That's where you'll see a lot of
content about Netflix. Netflix ran into
troubles with future expected growth.
They said that they're not only not
growing with subscribers, they're
actually turnurning. They're going to
lose some subscribers. They're going to
lose about a million subscribers. Wall
Street didn't like that. The stock price
valuation was raided and dependent on
continued fast future growth. When
Netflix indicated to investors that
growth is going to be upset, that growth
is going to be much slower than
expected, that they may not even have a
total addressable market to grow into,
investors became incredibly bearish on
the company incredibly fast. And in many
cases, this can catch you off guard. It
did with me. I didn't know that Netflix
was going to sell off 75%. After all, I
had it as my largest position. So,
Netflix began to sell off quarter after
quarter, two consecutive quarters, and
it sold down 75% from the highs. My top
position was completely obliterated.
Now, that was really stressful. That was
not a fun thing to have happen. And ever
since then, I've been careful when I
invest in companies that are dependent
on continued high growth rates, ones
that have a lesser established and more
volatile story. In that case, Netflix
was my biggest position. So, that was a
pretty tragic event for my portfolio. In
this case, Duelingo is my smallest
position. It is not a tragic event. This
isn't something that's really going to
impact the portfolio performance over
the long term. It is so far a 1% ding to
the portfolio. Now, in any case, I don't
like it when my stocks go down. I want
all my investments to do well, including
Dualingo, including even my small
positions. I put the $20,000 into this
stock because I want to make money with
it. So, let's go ahead and just take a
look at the situation that we're in. The
stock is is being rerated. It's down
30%, and these type of sell-offs happen
for specific reasons. They happen
because investors have determined that
this company no longer deserves the
premium multiple that it once traded at,
so they rerate it down to a lower
rating. The most common reason why is
because this company is dependent on
high growth. Investors have outlined and
underwritten high amounts of growth,
revenue growth of the company. And so
far, Dualingo has delivered on that
revenue growth. You can see the very
fast revenue growth. It growing 41%. It
it continued growing in the future. But
Dualingo gave investors a reason to be
concerned that growth may be
decelerating and that was in their
earnings report. In their earnings
report, they go over everything, but I
want to skip to the 2025 outlook and
beyond. When we look at the 2025
outlook, they have something here called
bookings. The Q4 bookings, so next
quarter to grow 22% year-over-year or
19% on a constant currency basis at the
midpoint. Now, why is this important?
It's important because Wall Street
believed that they were going to grow
their bookings at around 24%.
which is more than what they said
they're going to grow. So, Wall Street's
saying, "Oh, wow. Not only did they not
meet their booking estimates or exceed
it, but they didn't even come close.
They're they're below what we expected
them to grow." And so, we see a company
that's growing slower than expected.
Now, what is the booking growth? The
booking growth is like the amount of
subscribers and the amount of revenue
they're gaining that's advertised over a
year. So way to think of this is right
now the revenue that Dualingo is
receiving this quarter is bookings they
got last year. Meaning that the bookings
they get this year is going to be the
revenue they receive next year. So
bookings are a preview of the future and
the preview of the future shows revenue
slowing down. When a company's priced at
a premium multiple and revenue slows
down further than expected, you get
stock prices rerated. So that is the
single reason the stock is down today.
It is that booking number. Now, if we
look at other things, I think there's
actually a lot of positives in this
report, and I want to go over a handful
of them here. If we look at the overall
subscription revenue of the company, it
is growing incredibly fast. In fact, the
subscription revenue grew by 45%.
Subscription revenue makes up around 90%
of their total revenue because they are
a subscription-based company. What I see
here with this most recent quarter is
incredible economics. You have a company
that is growing the subscription base
over time. These users are also falling
in love with the product using it every
single day. And we see that in the other
numbers. For example, we have the
monthly active users. This is a big
scary point just a quarter ago. Remember
uh a big problem with Dualingo a quarter
ago was that their monthly active users
actually declined. It declined. Oh no.
Everybody was concerned about the
monthly active users going down. Will it
ever grow again? Was this because AI is
eating away at Dualingo's mode? Was this
because Google Translate is now stealing
customers? Well, this quarter proved
that wrong. It continued to grow even
past where it was in Q1. The growth of
the monthly active users is up 20%
year-over-year, and now they have 135
million monthly active users. So, I'm
personally very happy to see this
continuation of this trend. I thought
that it would continue back upwards, but
there was no guarantee. there was a
chance that the monthly active user
could come in below where it was last
quarter that it could continue on its
decline and we don't see that. So that's
good news for the Dualingo shareholder.
Then we have the daily active users.
These are people that log on and do a
lesson every single day, every day of
the month, the entire quarter. We have
it right here. It's now past 50 million
daily active users. We look at this and
it went from 47.7 to 50.5. Now this
level of engagement having 50 plus
million daily active users surpasses
many top social media companies. A lot
of them do not have 50 plus million
daily active users. So I like seeing
this growth as well. We see the paid
subscribers. The paid subscribers also
grew by 34% year-over-year. Now they
have 11.5 million. That's a bump up from
10.9 million the quarter before. We see
continued growth. All the charts going
up and to the right. So that's what we
see with Dualingo. All of these charts
are moving in the right direction. One
thing that didn't move as much as
investors may have expected is the paid
subscription penetration, but that is
for specific reasons. The management
noted that they're not focusing on that
right now. And this is part of the
concern of this quarter. Management
basically said that their main focus has
shifted. It's shifted away from turning
the screws of monetization and making
more revenue to now going for a big
opportunity. and the CEO highlighted
over and over again the opportunity that
they're going for. I want to play some
clips of the audio just from this most
previous earnings call of Lewis, the CEO
of the company, talking about the
opportunity he sees ahead with
education.
>> Yeah, I I mean, look, we're uh like like
you said uh and like I said in the
shareholder letter, um there's there's a
huge opportunity right now. We see a
huge opportunity um over the next few
years. education and the way people
learn um are they're going to change
fundamentally and and it's because of AI
and also because of AI we see we have
line of sight now to create an app that
can teach really really well much better
than anything that humanity has seen
before as good as a as a human tutor but
that is also more engaging um and if
we're able to do that you know right now
we have I don't know we just posted 135
million uh monthly active users if we're
able to do an app that teaches just that
well way much much better than we have
now. We would be talking about billions
of users that we have and that's what we
want to shoot for here. So this is why
we are we are um investing in the long
term and and what that look like looks
like is that we are putting relative
more relative investment in things like
teaching better which you know teaching
better if if we teach better what that
does is that that helps user growth but
there's a lag um you know just whenever
you improve your courses users do grow
but it takes a while for that to happen
and then user growth there's a lag to
get to monetization because people take
some time to subscribe. So, this is kind
of a long-term thing, but we're we're
we're very bullish on this and this is
why we're we're doing that.
>> He talks about how they're in the low
100 million users and his ambitions are
to get to billions of users and he
mentions this opportunity again
throughout the call multiple times. I
want to highlight one more time where he
talks about this uh as as to why now
this I mean it's a great question. The
reality is that over the last couple of
years um it has just become
progressively
clearer and clear that we are in a
unique point in time particularly with
education in terms of how education is
going to happen in the world and also
how well we can teach at Dualingo. We
just see it uh in our own metrics in you
know how how fast we can put out content
with things like video call. do we just
see how how much it is improving every
every month and so that just kind of has
been coming for for for a while and what
has happened is that over the over the
last month or two um I've really rallied
the company towards this this shift the
CEO has come to the conclusion that
we're at a very unique moment in time
where the landscape of education is
shifting dramatically he has this big
opportunity to grow into this category
of making Dolingo the go-to biggest
platform in the world for education and
they're trying to direct the company
more in that direction. Focus on getting
more users, making them more engaged,
focus on expanding the content slate and
better teaching. He highlights teaching
better multiple times throughout this
call. They're putting a little bit less
emphasis on converting users from the
free account to the paid account, making
it so that they can price things a
little bit higher. that's not going to
be something that they never do, but
it's just less of their company's
resources and intent and focus. So, that
is the the gear change. That's the
opportunity that this company sees. And
when you look at this, you can take it
two ways. Many people on Wall Street
will say, "Well, that just means that
we're going to get less bookings, less
subscriptions over the next year, which
means revenue won't be as high over the
next year because they make money
through those bookings." But that's not
the only thing he's saying. He's saying
part of this is a deliberate choice. If
Duelingo wanted to, they could make
bookings go through the roof. They could
make it grow by 50% next quarter. They
really could if they wanted to, but that
would be at the long-term detriment of
the company. And he explains how they
literally have these mechanisms to
determine how much they convert or how
much they don't convert users from the
free tiers to the paid tiers. They
determine that. They can do it through
all their AB testing. He highlights very
specific examples.
>> Uh some experiments improve all metrics.
Great. That's an easy call. Just launch
it because it improves all metrics. And
that happens. But there are times when
experiments improve one metric but hurt
another. I'll give you a a a fictitious
example. If right now um uh a free user
free users get 25 energy units at the
beginning of the day uh and every
exercise that they do spends one unit.
If we were to do an experiment that
decreases that from 25 to say 24, that's
one fewer unit of of of energy per day.
We know that would make us more money.
that it just does because more people
run out of energy, so more people end
up, you know, wanting to pay to
subscribe.
>> So, he has a mechanism right there that
he knows would up their revenue. He
could just turn it on at any point, just
make it so that the energy units are 24
per day instead of 25, and they'd
convert far more people to the paid tear
because they'd be frustrated with
running out of energy. So, why doesn't
Duolingo just do that? Why don't they
bump up revenue and give Wall Street
exactly what it wants, more bookings?
Well, he explains exactly why they're
not doing that in this next part.
>> However, we also know that would
decrease daily active users because it
would frustrate some of the users.
We've always had to make decisions
about, you know, different judgment
calls about this. What we mean is that
what we decorizing
user growth over monetization in this
type of of judgment call. In the
fictitious experiment that I just uh
gave you, we would not launch that
experiment going from 25 to 24 energy
units, even if it meant, you know, quite
a bit of bookings gains if it has uh a
real hit on daily active users.
>> So, Dualingo has these hundreds of
experiments they're running all the
time, testing their product on learning
outcomes and behaviors and engagement,
their user retention and churn, all
these different things that they're
constantly tuning and turning. And what
they're saying is with all of these
tests, they're now focusing primarily on
user growth and user retention. They're
not focusing quite as much on conversion
or revenue. When you put this in the
greater context of the direction of the
company, this is a very intentional
choice, a focus on organic growth and
big opportunities ahead where later on
down the road, once you've gotten the
opportunity, once you've really won,
then you can turn the screws of
monetization. That's exactly what Uber
did. At first, Uber was focused on
growth and they're highly unprofitable
business. But Uber grew and grew and
grew to scale. They seized the
opportunity ahead of them and now
they're highly profitable now that
they've met scale. It was the same thing
with Netflix. Netflix ran free cash flow
negative so long that analysts, many of
them were convinced they could never
turn a dime of profit. Even smart
analysts, great ones like Aswatorn said
Netflix is just a a broken business
model. That's what it does when a
company focuses on scale and opportunity
over immediate monetization. It can in
many cases trick investors and analysts.
And I believe that's what's going on
right now. Dualingo by the metrics is a
globally dominant company. You look at
any of the metrics and it is growing
like crazy. They have 11.5 million
subscribers. These people are loving
this product. They're using it every
single day. They're growing quarter
after quarter despite all the people
saying that they would not continue
growing that their daily active users
would go down their monthly active users
would decline because of artificial
intelligence because of chat GPT because
of Google translate because of the Apple
AirPods with live translation. People
said the company would die. They said
that the usage would go down. They said
the turn rate would go up. All user
engagement metrics and numbers and usage
are all going up. And in terms of the
moat of the company, many people are
again concerned about AI learning and AI
translation. This has been one of the
top concerns that I've heard about
Dualingo since the very beginning. And
in this call, the CEO addresses this
concern headon. Here's what he says. The
two things that people say about the
competitive landscape with AI are number
one, why would anybody want to learn a
language with Duolingo when you can just
learn it with Chacht? Um, okay. Uh, I,
you know, we're not particularly worried
about that. Um, you know, the we've said
it before, the main thing that uh that
we do really well, not only do we teach
well, but the main thing that we do
really well is keep people engaged. And
in order to learn a language, you need
to be engaged for years. Really, it
takes years to learn a language coming
every day. And we need to keep you
engaged, actually doing it. And not only
that, we also need to have curriculum
for years for you to do that. So, you
know, with chat GPT, you can go there
and you can ask it to teach you a few
words here and there, but you know, it's
not like you can have really curriculum
for years um uh that that that teach
that. So, we're not particularly worried
about that aspect. And then the other
thing that people uh you know have said
that they're worried about is oh well
nobody's going to want to learn a
language because um you know the we're
going to have simultaneous language
translation and okay. Um also not
worried about that. Um, you know, I I
believe in 100% of the Google IO
conferences over the last 10 years, they
have showcased simultaneous language
translation. They do it every single
year and it's good. It works. Uh, but
this has been happening for the last 10
years and we have not seen the desire to
learn a language go down at all. In
fact, it has come up. Um, and I think
the biggest reason for that is because
if you look at our users, they fall into
two two big categories. Uh, one big
bucket is people who are learning a
language as a hobby. It kind of doesn't
matter whether a computer can do that.
It's kind of the same with chess. By the
way, computers are way better than
humans at chess, but still, you know, we
have millions of people wanting to learn
chess that so it doesn't matter if it's
a hobby. The other big group of people
that are learning a language with us are
people who are learning English and they
actually want to learn English. Like
that is, you know, for them, you know,
being able to have like a phone that
they have to hold out, it just kind of
that's not what they what they want to
do. So, we just we're not particularly
worried about the that um it just so
happens that uh people like to tweet
about that, but we're not worried about
it. He highlights the distinction
between Dualingo and a chatbt. Although
you can practice the language on chatbt,
continuing to be motivated for years on
end every single day is what Dualingo
specializes in. And these other
companies have not done nearly the user
behavior testing to have that level of
engagement. The next thing is a live
translation, which he accurately says is
not a motivation for people to learn
languages. People don't learn languages
because of a lack of live translation.
Especially many people that are learning
languages for job opportunities or for
cultural reasons or for hobbies. Just
like learning chess, where there's
computers better than you at chess,
learning a language in many cases is a
hobby for people. And I agree with this
assessment. I think it's an honest
assessment of the differences between
Dualingo and just some AI learning app.
Now, Lewis goes on in this call
outlining all the different things that
they're doing for the future, improving
their teaching, adding more courses,
making it more engaging, making it so
that they're adding more content to
existing courses so they can teach
languages to a higher level, and so on
and so forth. In the chess course, for
example, they're making it so that you
can now have player versus player. Half
of iOS users have that. They say that
chess is in the millions of users
already. It has retention rates better
than their language learning. So they
are growing a new path with higher
levels of activity. But overall the big
thing that I want to highlight with
Dualingo and I think the the most
important thing is I noticed something
with this company in particular and that
is that investors do what investors end
up doing for every situation like this
which I think is a mistake. They let the
stock price movement inform them of
their opinion on the stock. Meaning they
don't look at the fundamentals. They
don't look at the the growth pass and
the future revenue expectations or
anything like that. They don't look at
the valuations. They simply look at a
stock price going up or going down and
they say that is what my opinion is. If
the stock went down, there must have
been a reason why Wall Street is pricing
it lower. That means that the stock is
doing poorly. That's what I see a lot on
Twitter, on YouTube comments, all across
X. I see people letting the stock price
inform them of their opinion on the
stock. For example, I believe in an
alternate world. If you had this result
and the stock price, for whatever
reason, went up 10%. But nothing
changed. Not the bookings, not the
growth rate, none of these metrics, I
believe that most investors would look
at this company and say, "This was a
great quarter. The stock should probably
be up a little bit." And look, Wall
Street is pricing it up, so it must have
been a great quarter. That's the
influence, the impression that the stock
price leaves on you. And I think that
this is a dangerous way to invest. After
all, if you let the stock price dictate
your impressions of a company, if you
let the movements and the volatility
tell you how to feel about a company,
then you would not have bought Netflix
when it fell 75%. You would have sold
out because the panic. It really looked
bad according to the stock price. Even
though at the time, we can look at the
real damage that happened to Netflix.
Let's go ahead and take a look at how
bad things really were when the stock
price dropped 75%. We have Netflix here.
We have total subscribers. The stock
price dropped 75% right there. That was
it. Because this quarter right there was
slightly less than that one. 75%
decrease in stock price. Total
obliteration.
All because of those two quarters. Now,
Wall Street said that Netflix was
basically worth nothing because a stock
was never going to grow again. They
didn't listen to the management. They
didn't listen to the password crackdown
narrative. They didn't listen to any of
the the long-term thesis or thought
process behind what the company's
actually doing. What Wall Street thought
was that this company was highly rated
because of fast growth. The company's
now not growing as fast, so the stock
needs to come down. That's the mechanics
of the market. But if you let the market
inform you on how to feel about a
company, you'd miss out on Netflix. And
there's plenty more examples where this
came from. In 2022, Amazon was trading
at $80 per share. Right there, $86 per
share. Now, Amazon trades at $240 per
share. So, $80 to $240. What happened in
2022? Well, of course, it was because
they're investing in capex for their
retail growth and that was expensive and
it caused the free cash flow to go down
a lot. Investors in Wall Street looked
at that and they said, "Oh, no. We're
not going to make as much money over the
next year. We need to abandon the
stock." Investors that looked at this as
an opportunity of a company investing in
its long-term future that's prioritizing
lifetime value of customers and
expansion over short-term profits made
immense gains in that stock. I bought
Amazon very close to $80 per share. I
bought it under $100 per share over and
over again. And that's the reason why
that's such a big winner in the
portfolio is because I didn't let the
market dictate my thoughts on the
company. And again, these examples can
go on and on. There's so many stocks
that drop down for short-term reasons
that if you let the stock price dictate
how you feel about the company, you're
going to be misled and you could
potentially miss out on huge gains. And
on this point, I want to highlight a
story from Jeff Bezos. This is when
Amazon stock price crashed by around
90%.
>> Amazon's stock in a very short period of
time went from $113
a share to $6 a share. Was very
concerning. And shareholders were upset.
Employees were nervous. Uh we had all of
our employee base, their parents were
all calling our employees and saying,
"Are you okay?" You know, this was the
environment of great nervousness. But I
looked at the numbers in the business
and every month as the stock price went
from 113 to six, the a number of
customers went up every month. Our uh
gross profits went up every month. Our
operating expense, we were still in a
loss position, but our our losses as a
percentage of sales went down every
month. every single business metric, new
customers, customer repeat purchases,
everything that we were monitoring
through that entire period kept getting
better.
And so this that's one observation about
bubbles in general. The fundamentals can
be disconnected. The fundamentals of the
business. And of course, as
entrepreneurs, you're focused on the
fundamentals of the business. The stock
price is an output, an ultimate output
that you actually have very little
control over. uh Benjamin Graham the
great investor is famous for saying in
the short term the stock market is a
voting machine in the long term it's a
weighing machine and so as founders and
entrepreneurs and business people our
job is to build a heavy company we want
to build a company that when it is
weighed
it is a very heavy company the goal for
entrepreneurs like Lewis the CEO and
founder of Dualingo is to forget about
the stock price you don't have any
control over that, then that's the
long-term output of what you do have
control over, which is the fundamentals,
making a heavy company. Now, I'm not
suggesting that Duelingo is the next
Amazon. I don't believe that. I'm not
suggesting it. But I do believe there's
an opportunity here where Duelingo could
still turn out to be a pretty heavy
company, one that has a massive amount
of users, a really well-liked company in
a very relevant industry. We've seen
these type of similar companies play
out. these large platform companies with
hundreds of millions of users that end
up growing to large established
companies that in the end become very
heavy companies. We've seen it with
Spotify. That was a company that many
people were worried about the music
labels. And look how wonderful of an
investment that's turned out. We've seen
it with Netflix. We've seen it with Door
Dash. We've seen it with Uber. All of
these companies were money losing. All
of them have very volatile histories.
All of them have time periods where
investors are super bullish or super
bearish on the company. And over time,
what matters is the weight of the
company. Is Dualingo going to become a
heavy company. Will it become a big,
large, established, profitable company
or not? If you don't believe it will,
then don't buy the stock. If you believe
it might, or there's a good chance of
it, then it might be worth biting at. It
might be worth one to consider. And in
any case, I'd never recommend making it
your entire portfolio. I'm not doing
that here. If Duelingo doesn't work out,
it'll be a bummer, but it's not going to
impact my portfolio's performance to a
massive degree. But I still believe
there's a good chance for upside because
like Jeff Bezos says, I'm looking at the
fundamentals. I'm seeing the metrics go
up and to the right for Duolingo. As
long as I see that happen, I'm not going
to sell the stock. And in fact, I may
dollar cost average and buy a bit more.
Now, let's go ahead and move on to some
news. Now, amongst this big sell-off,
there are a few companies that are at
least holding up right now. Google's one
of them. It's sticking in the green,
just barely teetering in the green,
despite the fact that the rest of the
market is selling off heavily and the
QQQ, the mega caps, are selling off even
more. Why is Google doing so well?
Because Google has even more good news.
The company said on Tuesday that the
seventh generation of its tensor
processing unit, the TPUs, called
Ironwood, will hit the market for public
use in the coming weeks after it was
initially introduced in April for
testing and deployment. The chip built
inhouse is designed to handle everything
from training of large models to
powering real-time chatbots and AI
agents. In connecting up to 9,216
chips in a single pod, Google says the
new Ironwood TPU eliminates quote data
bottlenecks for the most demanding
models and gives customers the ability
to run and scale the largest, most data
inensive models in existence. Now, if I
was blindfolded and I just heard this
line, I would think this has to come
from Nvidia. At the very least, it might
come from AMD. They they might say
something like that, but that's not
coming from Nvidia or AMD. Now, it's
Google. Google is also good. They're
they're not just good at YouTube.
They're not good at robo taxi. They're
not just good at cloud hosting. Now,
they're good at making chips. Really
powerful ones, in their words, can run
the most data inensive models in
existence. How did Google get this chip
so good? How did they get it so it
matches performance and efficiency of
top tier chips? Well, like many things
that Google does, they've been working
on it for a long time. They've just been
investors in all these projects for
decades. The TPUs have been in works for
a decade. Ironwood, according to Google,
is more than four times faster than its
predecessor. The AI startup Anthropic
plans to use up to 1 million of the new
TPUs to run its clawed model. If the
market wasn't having a big panic attack
today and selling off 2%, Google would
be up two to three% on this news.
There's no doubt about it. Now, moving
on, we get to our fail of the week. This
is the second fail of the week. So,
we're going to have a maybe we're going
to have a fail of the week on a daily
basis, a daily fail of the week. Don't
ask me how that makes sense, but that's
what this has turned into. In this case,
it's Chipotle. Now, Chipotle stock is
down a lot. That in and of itself is not
the fail of the week. Many stocks go
down for all different reasons, but
Chipotle is down around 50% on the year.
And it's not just the stock price. The
company's also struggling. For example,
even though Chipotle is opening up more
locations and they're seeing some growth
that way, the average revenue per
location is declining and it's been
declining quarter after quarter. One of
the major problems with Chipotle is very
clear. Anyone that has gone there
frequently knows about this issue. It is
a fact that going to Chipotle to some
degree is a bit of a gamble. You don't
really know what you're going to get.
It's very inconsistent. And this is an
anecdote from my experience, but it's
also one that's shared amongst millions
of people. We look at viral tweets like
this. This is from Mike from Chipotle
Tweets. He's tweeted that uh he he
actually did kind of like a a little bit
of a sting operation on Chipotle. He
said that I ordered these burritos 15
minutes apart from the same store today.
The one on the left I ordered in person
and it's twice the size as the one on
the right which was ordered online. My
order online is always significantly
smaller every time. Stop ripping us off.
Off to the left, we can clearly see the
burrito is almost twice as big as the
one on the right. The one on the right
is like a normalsized burrito. The one
on the left is gigantic. And again, this
is not just Mike. Uh when he tweeted
this, everybody said the same thing.
This has 10 million views, 144,000
hearts, 7,000 retweets. This is one of
the most viral tweets across Twitter is
people saying, "I know this experience.
I've also gone and ordered online and I
get ripped off." Now, we can only
speculate why the digital ordering and
online ordering has such smaller portion
sizes than in person. But if I had to
guess, I believe it's because when you
go in person, the employee feels more
pressured to kind of deliver a good
burrito. They see you right there
looking at what they're doing. So, they
at least see some human connection when
it's just digitally. They go in the back
kitchen, they prepare something, they
don't even have to see you. They never
see you through the drive-thru really.
So, there's not that human connection.
Now, the previous CEO of Chipotle
noticed that this is a problem. He even
suggested going in person and then if
you get a smaller portion size than what
you believe you should have, if it's a
kind of a smaller portion size than what
you want, you give the employee the nod.
You give them a nod to get the portion
size you deserve. Here he is talking
about that. One of the things I think
it's great about Chipotle is if you come
into the restaurant and you want a
little more rice or you want a little
more pico, all you got to do is kind of
like and usually our guys and women give
them a little more scoop. Now, I don't
know about you and you may think I'm
crazy here, but I don't believe that the
customer should be the one responsible
for making sure their burrito is made
with the proportions that they're paying
for. I think if you just ask for
something, if you say, "I want a burrito
with chicken," then it should come with
the right amount of chicken. You
shouldn't have to give them a nod to
say, "Hey, I really want the the full
amount that I'm paying for." I don't
think that should be the case. And it
seems like I'm again not the only one
that feels this way. There are massive
amounts of posts on this subject with
tens of thousands of people, hundreds of
comments, all saying the same thing that
this company has a problem with
inconsistent portions. Chipotle has even
been sued for inconsistent portion
sizes. The inconsistent portion sizes of
Chipotle's food is such a big deal that
one Wells Fargo analyst took it upon
himself to do an in-depth study on the
subject. He ordered a 100 burritos from
all different locations at all different
times. He had the exact same order every
single time. The bowl weight varied
widely. The lightest bowl was three
standard deviations below the median.
Meaning that this is not just an
anecdotal experience. This is a
mathematical certainty. Chipotle has
wildly varying portion sizes with the
food that they give to their customers.
Management of Chipotle don't seem to
know how to solve this problem. They've
tried to tell their employees, "Hey, do
better." They tried to train them
better. But so far, they don't have an
answer. And Chipotle has taken to
blaming the economy in their most recent
earnings, saying, "Our third quarter
performance fell short of our
expectations due to persistent
macroeconomic pressures." And that
certainly is a factor. I'll admit that
it plays into any restaurant, but
there's also a big factor that you do
have control over. Even though the CEO
does not have control over the economy,
they do have control over how they run
their restaurant, and they could get rid
of this frustration that many customers
deal with. And luckily for the Chipotle
management, I have the answer. I have
the solution. This is a a really easy
problem to solve, and I'm going to lay
out the answer today. This will change
Chipotle for the better. When we see
this implemented, you're going to have a
better product because your product will
be completely consistent every single
time. We can take the example of a
restaurant called Mobettas. It's a
Hawaiian style restaurant. Uh it's a
really good one. I actually love this
place. So, if you've ever if you've ever
been around a Moetta, go try it out if
you haven't. I think you'll like it. But
we have a guy here. He's doing a food
review like Chipotle. This is a
restaurant where you have all the
pictures of the food. You have all these
different orders and you go up in a and
you go up and you assemble your food in
the line. So, we get to where they
prepare the food. Again, you go down the
line, they prepare it exactly like
Chipotle's. But there is one notable
difference, one thing that is just
different than what Chipotle does that
makes it so at this restaurant, you get
perfectly consistent portions of the
protein every single time you go in.
Let's look at exhibit one. We have it
right here. I'll outline it in red.
Right there we have exhibit one. That is
a scale. That's a food scale. What
Moveas does is they take your plate of
food. Before they put any protein in it,
they put it on the scale. They hit a
button that zeros out the scale. Then
they put food on to where you have the
amount of food in weight that is the
amount you're paying for. So, as a
customer, you see them pick up the food,
put it in the plate on the scale, and
then they have a nice little margin,
right? It has to be very close, but they
have a nice little margin of the amount
of food you paid for. It doesn't take
hardly any additional time. In fact, it
takes probably about 2 to 3 seconds
longer. But that 2 to 3 seconds longer
ensures that you get the correct
proportion of food. All Chipotle needs
to do is add the scales. That's it. They
add the scales and they figure out one
massive problem for the business. Food
scales are cheap. They're easy to
implement. They're easy to train. It
fixes a massive complaint for the
company. It doesn't cost the company
much in capex. and their throughput or
the rate that they can get people
through the line really isn't slowed
down that much. Maybe 3 to 4 seconds to
ensure you get a better experience. So
even though this is the fail of the
week, it's also ending on a positive
note. I'm glad together we could fix
Chipotle. We could make it a better
company and overall we can make that
unit volume grow again because if you
know what you're getting, you're going
to go there more often. That's going to
be it for this episode. Hope you
enjoyed. See you in the next one.
