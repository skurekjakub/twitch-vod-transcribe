The other day, I started receiving
messages from people asking me if Japan
is okay. Linking a rather ominous
sounding video called, "What is
happening to Japan?" It wasn't just the
title and thumbnail that were ominous,
but the description reading, "Is Japan
cooked?" I've seen a lot of changes, and
things seem to be getting worse. In an
era where I'm now being sent daily AI
videos and photos that sorely
misrepresent Japan from bizarre and
questionable accounts, it made an almost
refreshing change to be sent something
produced by a human being. And more
crucially, a creator who is one of the
biggest foreign content creators living
in Japan with 1.4 million subscribers on
YouTube alone and hundreds of thousands
more across other social media
platforms. In fact, the same video had
been chopped up into half a dozen videos
without dialogue and shared on Instagram
and Tik Tok, amassing over 3 million
views in just a matter of days. Now, I
was especially concerned, not just as
somebody living in Japan or Tokyo, but
actually this street where the
thumbnail's taken is somewhere I walked
down once or twice a week in Nakamero.
One of my favorite coffee shops is just
around the corner. And in fact, this
video I made earlier in the year was
filmed on the same street, albeit at a
different angle, not showing the
abandoned house. And not to mention,
I've actually been living in the
neighborhood myself for the last 3
years. And when I went to take the
thumbnail for my video, I quickly
noticed a few interesting differences
between my original ungraded photos and
the thumbnail of her video. It is a
rather fascinating game of spot the
difference. So, naturally, I was a bit
concerned to find out what is happening
to Japan, especially as over 3 million
people had seen this message. For half
of the runtime in the video, the creator
in question walks through Kabuki Chaw in
Shinjjuku, Japan's biggest nightlife
district with a reputation for being
dirty and gritty, filming bin bags,
litter, and homeless people. In the
short form content, the same videos show
the litter being into cut at times with
foreign tourists who are queuing
unremarkably to take a photo of the Toho
Godzilla statue. Although the angle of
the statue was left out the footage and
it's at this point I need to reiterate,
if you don't know Japan, Kabuk or
Shinjjuku can be a bit of a shock. It's
the equivalent of walking through
downtown LA or Soho in London. And in
recent years, it's been gentrified more
than perhaps anywhere in Tokyo. It used
to be genuinely quite dangerous. I
remember 10 years ago, I made a hotel
reservation there and had to cancel it
after there was a Yakuza shootout quite
literally across the road from the
hotel. The area is also synonymous with
Tokyo's homeless population as far back
as 2003 when the film Tokyo Godfathers
shone a spotlight on the long-standing
homeless population which according to
the statistics is thankfully going down.
And if you walk around there today
compared to 10 years ago there are far
less homeless people. But crucially,
Kabuk Cho and Shinjjuku doesn't
represent Tokyo. It doesn't represent
Japan. But if you wanted to make Japan
look cooked, it would be the first place
you would go pull out your camera and
hit record. The other half of the
runtime in these videos was dedicated to
Nakamero, a trendy district that's
historically one of Tokyo's most
artistic neighborhoods. And with a
recent history of graffiti, both
artistic and just tagging where people
just spray paint their name. A few years
ago, I think it was 2019, there was
quite a lot of graffiti and the local
schools got together to paint over it.
And then the graffiti came back again.
But when Japanese TV made a video on it,
interviewing locals, interestingly, they
didn't intercut it with shots of Asia's
biggest nightlife district and call it
what is happening to Japan. They called
it residents express discomfort at 37
graffiti sites found around Nakamero
station. And maybe that's why despite
having twice the number of subscribers,
they only got 100,000 views instead of
almost half a million. Silly traditional
media attempting to present news in an
objective manner in 2025. And so at this
point you might be thinking, "Okay,
right. So what's what's happened to
Japan? What happened next?" Now lean in.
Come closer. Come. Come over.
That was it. That was literally it. In a
country of 120 million people, they were
all cooked because of some bin bags in a
red light district and some spray paint
on a wall down six or seven streets in
the capital city. And while the YouTube
video was 15 long, stupid minutes I'll
never get back, it was the short form
content that really concerned me. We
live in a scary time when more people
now than ever before learn things about
countries and cultures from 30 to
60-cond videos without context and where
the more sensationalist the videos are,
the more you will be rewarded for it.
People are angry both in Japan and
around the world at the moment. And this
video or these videos seem to be
exceptional rage bait that made a lot of
people angry. without any exposition on
Tik Tok, Instagram, YouTube shorts, they
showed a series of awful images in a
densely populated area. And if you look
at the comment sections, particularly on
those shorts, you will see the most
vile, hateful, angry comments that you
can find. A creator isn't responsible
for what people comment on their
content. But subtle choices, the way the
images and clips are cut and edited
together with the message that goes with
it can have a very powerful effect. As
somebody who's edited over 300 videos,
I'm more aware of that than anyone. The
most unsettling thing is it's never been
easier to monetize sensationalist slop
content. And if you do it, you'll be
richly rewarded for it. Uh case in
point, this video the creator pointed
out made $1,500,
which is a seriously impressive amount
of money going around filming some bin
bags and some spray paint in a video
that would have taken a matter of hours
to record. And this is one of the things
that worries me the most, the
monetization of slop sensationalist
content. That's one thing I want to
discuss a little bit later on. It's at
this point I thought, look, just don't
say anything. Bite your tongue, move on.
But when I saw millions upon millions of
views, people angry, a current backdrop
of sensationalist sloped content taking
over, and a rise in anti-forign
sentiment here in Japan. I snapped. I
had to say something. I chose to bring
attention to it publicly. And I quickly
received two replies. The first was from
a guy who posted a photo of some
graffiti he saw in 1993 pointing out
graffiti has always been around in
Tokyo. And the other comment was from
the content creator herself who told me
to take it down. This was now a creator
on Creator Matter and they were just a
humble creator with a GoPro somehow
conveniently forgetting they were one of
the biggest foreign content creators in
Japan. Now I think if you are a large
content creator both literally and
metaphorically, you should be willing to
accept a degree of scrutiny. I know I
do. Every time I release a video, people
attack me for various things. And if I
see something that I believe misconstr
reality, then I'm going to call it out
as well. Impressively, no less than 6
hours later, she had shot, edited, and
released an entire video about what
she'd called an attack, calling me a
gatekeeper. I was accused of painting
Japan as a utopia. I was accused of
excluding her from my friendship group,
somebody I've never met, never spoken
to. I was accused of being grumpy, maybe
because her viewers had claimed that she
was more attractive than me and less
grumpy. And no, I'm not making this up.
This is actually a real video. And
finally, I was called the C-word, just
to add the cherry on top. It is
ironically one of the most bizarre
personal rambling attacks that I've ever
had. And I think it is really pointless.
It degrades any sort of debate or
conversation. And it's the least
important thing that I want to talk
about today. And for some clarity, I
really don't dislike this person. I
dislike their content. Uh not just this
video, but some other videos, which I'll
I'll discuss. I know I can be sarcastic
and silly, but I'm genuinely not a
malicious person. I quite honestly wish
her well. And I ask you if you disagree
with her, if you disagree with me, that
you always comment in a respectful
manner and don't share any hatred
online. There's already enough of that
going around. And I'm making this video
for two reasons. Number one, uh there
are much bigger issues in play here
around content creation around Japan,
and I want to discuss those. And second
of all, uh some people see it as me
bullying another creator because they
don't understand why I would bring this
up. And honestly, I don't do this sort
of thing lightly. Uh the only time I
think I've ever called out a creator was
Mr. Beast last year when he partnered
with Logan Paul, a man who did awful
things in Japan, which I had to discuss
publicly on Japanese national
television. I didn't enjoy making that
video or the attention or scrutiny it
brought me. I hate myself sometimes that
I can't keep my mouth shut on certain
things. But when you feel something is
profoundly wrong in here, you have to
talk about it. I've held my tongue
previously on other content uh that this
creator has produced. A few years ago, a
friend showed me a clip of a video in
which the same person walked through an
economically deprived part of Tokyo
filming homeless people under the guise
of showing the real Japan, filming the
most vulnerable people in society and
posting it online. Like, I've had
Japanese friends tell me this sort of
stuff makes them feel uncomfortable.
Beyond that, it sort of portrays Japan
as this magical place where there's a
barrier between us, where if you speak
Japanese, they will bounce around. They
will scream and shout. It will cure
depression. as if the entire country is
one big social experiment waiting to be
exploited. And I worry in an era of
nuisance content creators coming to
Japan doing things that are unspeakably
bad, they might see this sort of content
and go, "Wow, you get $1,500 for that?"
Maybe start to wave cameras around in
the faces of homeless people,
potentially leading to even more
nuisance content. And when the cost of
making such content is nothing, but the
profits are extraordinary, the only real
thing stopping you from doing that is
morals. And as we've seen time and again
with streamers in Japan, morals are
often in short supply. And coupled with
the fact there's rising anti-forign
sentiment in Japan, it makes me
concerned and uncomfortable. So what are
the real issues facing Japan? What is
happening to Japan? In the last few
weeks, I've been traveling around the
country filming videos. I've been to
Sendai, Nagono, Nagoya, GeFu, Okinawa,
and spending time with the locals out
there, talking with them, hearing their
concerns. I can assure you none of them
care about a [ __ ] bin bag in
Shinjjuku or some spray paint on a wall
in Nakamero. The two most notable things
are depopulation and a cost of living
crisis. And funnily enough, while this
stuff was happening, I was on an island
in Okinawa interviewing the locals on
how depopulation has affected their
island. Where once there were hundreds
of people, today there are 50. And this
is obviously affected island life. Quite
honestly, I would much rather be editing
that video than talking about this. But
it will take me weeks to edit that video
and do the islander story justice. And
this takes me to the real crux of the
matter, the thing that worries me the
most. In the same time that it will take
to produce this video, I could go out
and film 50 of these videos, make a lot
more money with a lot less effort. It is
increasingly hard to compete when you're
producing videos to a higher standard
when you have to fact check everything.
The creator of this video claimed it
took 50 hours to produce this video. A
claim I find to be quite frankly
baffling. I'm not sure where the 50
hours went. And you might think, well,
he does sound kind of jealous now. Maybe
she's right. Maybe he's just not getting
the views. And I say, far from it. I
could go out and make this content in
one afternoon in Tokyo. What I'm saying
is social media platforms don't care.
They don't reward accuracy. They don't
reward nuance or objective reason. They
reward clicks. They reward attention.
They reward sensationalism. Journalistic
integrity really doesn't count for much
online, unfortunately, uh, to an almost
dystopian degree. Some criticisms
leveled at me is that I also make
sensationalist content and that I only
show the nice side of Japan, the squeaky
clean rosetinted spectacle version of
the country. And to that, I would say
there's a big difference between
sensationalist content and clickbait
titles and thumbnails. I hate having to
pull a stupid face. I hate my thumbnails
and titles. But it is simply a matter of
survival on an increasingly crowded
platform that doesn't share your content
unless it has a high click-through rate.
And I tried to make up for the stupid
faces and titles by delivering content
that does the subject matter justice.
And the claim that I show only the
overromanticized utopian version of
Japan is simply ridiculous. Does this
look romanticized?
Is this a utopia?
Does that look romanticized?
Is this a utopia? But do I walk through
economically deprived parts of Tokyo
with a GoPro? No, I don't. And I'm sorry
if that is the only definition of
showing the dark side of Japan that you
have. I cover the matters that I
genuinely believe are affecting Japan
the most. And in fact, I've been
speaking with a homeless shelter about
doing a documentary, but it's a serious
topic and these are people's lives and I
need to tackle that carefully. If you
want to watch something about Japan's
homeless population, Life Where I'm From
has made a fantastic documentary series
on the subject. I would urge you to go
and watch them. I will say I felt sort
of disheartened this year in general
about so many things about the state of
the world and this is sort of to the
side of this issue. As you may know I've
been living here uh over a decade now
about 13 years and I've been extremely
lucky to be here and I've always tried
to show Japan in a fair and balanced way
particularly more rural areas that I
love which I've been lucky to call home
and more and more I'm seeing comments
and discourse online that I'm just a
foreign guy living in Japan. I don't
understand the culture. I'm a foreign
guy exploiting Japan. And I've had that
claim thrown at me more in the last 12
months than in the last 12 years
combined to the point it has sort of
sucked the energy out of me a bit and
made me wonder what am I doing.
Does what I do matter anymore. No matter
how many documentaries I make, no matter
what I shine a spotlight on, no matter
who I meet or what I do, just a foreign
guy exploiting Japan. And I felt Yeah, I
felt lost about what I what am I what am
I doing here? I was far happier as a
smaller creator without the burden of
expectations,
without people uh overanalyzing
everything I said or did. And to be
frank, the only thing that keeps me
doing this is knowing I'm very lucky to
have an amazing audience of people. I
know you're not just numbers on a view
count. You're actually real people. And
I'm very grateful I've got to meet so
many of you. I sort of need to know if
you're watching that I'm not going mad
here. If there's one thing to take away
from this video, it's to remember on the
road ahead, whatever the algorithm
throws at you, it's never been more
important to call out things that are
fundamentally wrong. What you choose to
click on has honestly never mattered
more. And unfortunately, much of the
time, you don't get a choice in what you
click on on some of the short form
content. We can look at the awful things
that are curated for us on screen and
accept that as reality, or we can go out
into the world and uh make sense of it
for ourselves. But we must remember the
bigger picture because if we don't, I
think bad things are going to happen
beyond this. I don't want to be
negative,
but I have to speak my mind. Otherwise,
what's the point of it all? Right. And
the good news is I'm looking forward to
to getting back to many wonderful videos
that I've shot in the last few days on
an island with Natki rumaging through a
forest.
Uh there's lots of great things to come.
So, thank you. Um, thank you as always.
