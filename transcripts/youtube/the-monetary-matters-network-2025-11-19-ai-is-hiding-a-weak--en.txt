The issue is that many of the AI
companies themselves are not profitable.
That's obviously a concern because you
can always have very good growth numbers
when you're selling $20 bills for $10.
We could see the rollover in kind of the
for the price and then capex maybe
follows by a year or two. If I had to
give a base case, it might be something
like that. We've already seen credit
default swaps of some of these AI
related bonds. That's an early signal
the market saying, are you are you guys
sure about this?
>> Whoever says Hosi is do you think
they're still alive?
>> That's a good question, but my my guess
is
>> today's episode is brought to you by
Vanex Rare Earth and Strategic Metals
ETF. ticker remx. Later in the show,
you'll hear about the growing investment
opportunity behind rare earths and why
these materials are crucial to
everything from smartphones to defense.
Let's get into it. Hey everyone, to help
you navigate this long conversation,
Lynn talks about Fed liquidity at the
24-minute mark, about Bitcoin and who
Satoshi is starting at the 33minut mark,
and about whether AI is in a bubble at
the 76 minute mark. Enjoy. Very happy to
welcome back to Monetary Matters, Lynn
Alden of Lynn Alden Investment Strategy.
Lynn, good to see you.
>> Always happy to be back.
>> Lynn, I'm going to get into many topics
with you. AI, Bitcoin, Fed liquidity,
everything. But just want to start off,
Lynn, is is the economy bad? Is the non
AI capital expenditure economy bad? You
know, I just looked up what would the
GDP growth be if there was no capital
expenditure on data centers and AI? And
according to Jason Ferman, the
economist, who actually I've
interviewed, it would be 0.1%. Whereas
now the real GDP now cast from the
Atlanta Fed for the third quarter is
4.1%. So there's just a huge divide and
you know a majority of the growth in
this country is from one industry data
center capex. So is the economy weak
other than other than data centers and
are you concerned about the part of the
economy that is not data centers?
>> The short answer is yes and yes. Most
kind of indicators are pretty weak. I
wouldn't bad I I would say they're weak
more than they're they're bad. Bad is a
more complicated term. They are
generally speaking not catastrophic but
certainly not good. Um so and I would
even add to that things that are not on
either the right side of AI capex or
fiscal deficits. Those are really kind
of the two big stimulus areas. Uh and
then the weak areas is is most other
things. So things that are on the wrong
side of of tightish monetary policy. So
commercial real estate, residential real
estate, less liquid, you know, types of
private equity, some some pockets of
venture, a lot of that type of stuff is
on the weaker side. We've had a long
period of flattish PMIs, both
manufacturing and service, and they're
not like so low that they're you
normally see in a recession, but they've
had an unusually long period without
kind of a reflation cycle in that
regard. So there's lots of headlines
around restoring manufacturing. When you
actually look at the manufacturing PMI,
it's it's just chopping along in like a
mildly stagnating way for for years now
and really no change here in 2025. So a
lot of a lot of weakness. Now that's
weakness built on a somewhat robust
frames. I think banks are pretty well
capitalized. They've gone into this with
a lot of kind of risk mitigation in
play. And so I I view it as kind of less
likely to just completely fall out of
bed uh in many of these areas. But
there's this kind of like longer grind
of weakness. And then on the other side
is it's partially held up by
structurally large fiscal deficits
combined with the obviously the very
important AI trend. Uh and so it's a I
would describe it more as that twospeed
economy rather than a weak economy
because you have pockets that are weak
but not necessarily catastrophic. You
have a couple small pockets that are
basically catastrophic. I mean
commercial office real estate is a
slowmoving train wreck. Um but for the
most part you have stagnation and then
you have boom and then of course it also
triggers along class lines uh because a
lot of the weakness we see is among
lower income segments that are generally
not on the right side of of of AI and
then they're also often ironically not
on the right side of fiscal deficits.
You know there's obviously some portions
of the fiscal deficits that go to that
group but a large swath of the fiscal
deficits go toward social security,
Medicare, defense and interest expense.
So that's not that that kind of big huge
chunk of the pie chart is not really
going to the the lower income. And so
that that that's kind of the segment
that's struggling the most.
>> Yeah. I mean, Lyn, I saw a chart. I'm
sure you've seen it. You probably made
this chart that but that the the
net expenditure that you give or get
from the government over as you age and
go throughout your life. So from the
ages of 20 to 55, you were just a
massive taxpayer to the government. From
zero to 20, you you get money from the
government for childare and ch child tax
credits and stuff. And then when you you
are a senior 65 and over, social
security, you are just a a massive
recipient of government stimulus. And
like that system, social bargain kind of
worked maybe when the demographic period
pyramid looked like 1960, 1970. But I'm
just looking at the sentiment out there
and I think there are a lot of young
people who are not happy with the
current arrangement and they're like,
whoa, there there's way too many of you
to to be doing this. Exactly. I think
you touched on the demographics is is
probably the biggest issue that it's a
much more topheavy system than it was
when it was designed. It was kind of
designed with the idea that every
generation would be bigger than the
prior one, which of course has not not
been the way that it's really gone. So,
you have a more topheavy entitlement
system and then you add on a couple
extra things, which is generally
speaking, you need more student loans to
go into the workforce now than you did
in in the decades prior. So, you kind of
start from a deeper negative. And then
two, it's it's demographics, but it's
also kind of the skill with which we
handle some of these systems. For
example, in Japan, they obviously have
have worse demographics. But for
example, despite living longer, they
spend less per capita on healthcare than
we do for a variety of reasons. United
States has the highest per capita
healthcare costs, which is particularly
relevant when you have an aging kind of
worsening demographics population. So
not only do we have this kind of
demographic skew, we we then also kind
of add fuel to the fire by having very
high healthare costs and other frictions
along the way. So you get this right now
we've kind of the the the social fabric
and the the social implications I'd say
are weakening faster than the broad
economic data because the broad economic
data has that kind of higher income
group and then those on the right side
of fiscal deficits or AI capex kind of
holding holding things up. So if a
majority of the economic growth in the
US is from artificial intelligence and
data center growth and a a majority of
the corporate profits in the S&P not
necessarily the corporate profits but
the corporate profits growth is is also
AI capex. Is the US economy and the S&P
500 just a bet on on AI now? And if so
how do you feel about this bet? Lynn, as
a someone who's trained as an engineer,
what do you think about AI? And do you
think that the massive sums being poured
into this space, $400 billion this year,
maybe a trillion dollars in 2028,
something like that, I don't know, is
going to be is going to be worth it from
from a societal sense, from an
investment sense as well?
>> Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, we
could have a whole podcast on that
topic. Uh, so it's hard to, of course,
summarize that. The short answer I I I I
think that it's real. Like I think that
basically the economic the long-term
economic growth in this will be
substantial but like many things I think
there will be bubbles along the way. Uh
that was of course true for the internet
where people said it's going to change
everything and they did. It just it took
took you know more time than some of
those initial investments uh thought.
For example, those laying the you know
the fiber optics cables. Uh when we look
over say Bitcoin over the past 16 years
it's both true that at times it's a
bubble but that it's also been
structural uh from bubble to bubble. Uh
and so I I kind of view AI similarly
that it it can get over its skis for
periods of time, but that when we look
back five 10 years from now, we will say
yes, this was quite transformative and
that it it it changed both the economy
and kind of the nature of a lot of
things. From a I guess kind of separate
finance and engineering. So we look at
it from a financial perspective.
Obviously the issue is that many of the
AI companies themselves are not
profitable. uh it's very much funded by
VC which is normal in an earlier stage
of of a technology. Uh but when you're
talking about kind of some of the
biggest private companies in the world
uh still running unprofitably and
importantly not really even having a
forecast to get the profitability
anytime soon that's obviously a concern
because you can always have very good
growth numbers when you're selling $20
bills for $10. But if your growth just
comes to a halt when you when you aim
toward being profitable and stop being
kind of that externally funded system,
it can it can reverse quicker than
people think. So obviously Nvidia is
making money and the uh you know the the
big kind of hyperscalers uh are making
money and it's really kind of the other
areas that are unprofitable and
therefore funded more by speculation uh
about what they will do in in say over
five years let alone not even really
have tracking toward profitable in the
next five years. saying that's a that's
a reasonable concern right there that
things can reverse quicker than people
think even if even when you still have a
very real trend. The engineering hat in
me basically separates data center AI
from portable AI because a lot of
people's mind when they hear AI they
also immediately lump in robots with
them
>> and uh one of the key things I think is
is very relevant is there's a huge
difference between like intelligence and
portable intelligence uh which is true
for a lot of things basically whenever
you're taking energy and you're making
it portable uh in this case when you're
taking processing power and making it
portable that's a radically different
conversation. Uh and so I think that the
a a the data center portion is very much
real in the sense that there's a good
chunk of white collar work that much
like how there is a lot of blue collar
work that we were able to displace uh
with automation and basically make that
each each remaining worker can therefore
produce a lot more because they're
basically overseeing and assisting
machines in terms of making and doing
things. I do think that in white collar
work we already are seeing and will
continue to see that type of thing where
uh many types of white collar work not
all of it but many types of it will be
learning to work with and overseeing
machines AI machines in this case that
take things that used to be pretty labor
intensive and make them much less labor
intensive because we're outsourcing that
to data centers now in the field auto
like robots and things like that that's
a much higher bar like when you look at
data center when they when when you look
at say like say Ray Kurs Kurswheel the
whole you know the singular and all that
he kind of maps out how much how much
neuron activity is happening in the
brain and then you can look at hardware
over over years and decades and see you
know what does it kind of cost uh you
know when when are our computers
reaching what the human brain can do uh
and it's not it's not quite apples to
apples because a 100 years ago a
calculator could do more uh linear
calculation than a typical human brain
could do even as obviously it was way
worse in virtually every other area. So
it's not like apples to apples, but over
time computers and especially
supercomputers have kind of reached
roughly speaking the the closest
estimates we have for how much
processing power happens in a human
brain. The the key difference though is
that the brain runs on something like 20
watts. It runs on less than a typical
incandescent light bulb whereas that
level of processing power in a data
center is measured in megawws, millions
of watts. And so that's not obviously
not something you can in any sort of
investable time horizon put into a
portable system, right? So so in the
field you're going to have a lot more
shortcomings. And it's the edge cases
where I think there's a huge difference.
Basically that that overseeing role.
Humans can automate things but they
still are the solvers of edge cases
because that's where those more nuances
matter. So I do think that there will
there will be disruption. I do think
that there will be change, but then I do
think that for at least for a long
period of time, we're going to hit a
plateau where we kind of absorb the
changes that have happened and look out
long enough, anything can happen, but in
any sort of re like investable time
horizon or career time horizon. I do
think it's real, but not quite to the
heights that maybe the the hyperbols
would would say.
>> Yeah, thank you. Well, the hyperbulls
think, you know, AGI AGI is coming any
any day, any any week. So Lynn, explain
that concept of difference between
intelligence computing power and
portable computing power because you
know on my iPhone so many of the
computations are done in a in a cloud in
a data center and that's been the the
huge transformation of the past 20 years
is but yeah basically all the
computation happens in in the data
center not on the device and as such you
you can do way more way more powerful
things. I don't I don't I don't know but
is that how a robot works or is all the
action in the robot's chip uh you know
in its in its brain?
>> Yeah, it depends on the type. Um there
can be and there can be a mix of both.
You can do local processing and off off
local processing back to the data
center. The challenge is this one is is
obviously speed and bandwidth. anytime
you're doing processing that is not
local, you obviously, you know, you're
going back to a data center where
there's more resources, but then you're
also introducing lag into the uh aspect,
which if you're looking up something on
your phone is fine. Uh if if you're a
robot trying to deal in the field, that
could be obviously more challenging that
that speed can be an issue. Uh number
two, your phone is often doing
non-critical things. Meaning obviously
phones are a huge part of our life, but
it's you it's not going to be life or
death if if your phone has a period of
time where it it goes slow or that the
the connection like the the data is is
stuck or limited in some way. It's not
as though that a car is going to crash
or a robot that's doing something pretty
critical is going to have like a a
meaningful loss of property or life. And
so we introduce those things. A lot of
that more more more generally speaking
has to be local because it has to be
able to not get itself into a situation
where losing data has very costly in
many ways ramifications. So the kind of
the ideal situation is you have
something that's smart locally but that
can call back to a data center for edge
cases but that's to limit it to things
that can only have major losses if its
callbacks fail in one way or another. So
I I you know I'm long-term bullish
obviously on almost any type of
technology you can imagine. Like I do
think that robotics will be a bigger
part of our life in in years and
decades. Um I do think that a lot of
white collar work will be you know
automated and and our nature of of work
will shift in that area. It'll become a
a common part of our workflow. Uh and it
already is uh for for people that have
been on this pretty early. But that
there's still I mean there's a
fundamental difference between the types
of thought that AI does and what the
human brain does. I would say a AGI is
pretty fundamentally different uh than
the types of AI we've seen and that
there's still kind of a lot of work to
do in the robotics. I mean, one of my
go-to things uh is for decades, they've
been trying to make robot vacuum
cleaners work, right? Uh and of course,
they you know, they they quote work, but
the the technology is not not even
gotten to the point where it's so
dominant that it just replaces, you
know, manual vacuum cleaning. Uh th
those companies have actually struggled
if you look at some of their stocks. And
that's a fairly simple thing overall
because you have a for the most part a
flat surface, occasional stairs and
things like that. You have a pretty
defined goal. Clean this flat surface
with some stairs and stuff in a home
where a human can occasionally help you
with edge cases. And yet that's still
been a struggle to make that economic
reliable not encountering so many errors
that it just the human just gives up on
it and gets a normal vacuum cleaner. and
and even that basically has been slower
than expectations, let alone far more
expensive, far more complex things. So I
I do think that a lot of this will be
solved. But a general rule in
engineering is like hardware is always
kind of way harder than you think,
especially compared to like software.
Obviously there are very challenging
software problems all the time, but
hardware like the the cycles with which
you you try something and then and then
correct that and try again and correct
it again. Those cycles are much slower
than they are in the world of pure
software. Deploying things into the
field, getting data, doing the next
generation of things in the field. It
it's often a much slower process than
people think. And when you compare it, I
mean, when you pair it with kind of
Moore's law and just overall getting
processing at the edges uh in a way that
is both fast and reliable compared to
the the the criticalness of what it's
doing are some pretty serious
limitations. Um, so yeah, I would
describe myself as a moderate bull on AI
and a bigger bull on things that are
more readily put into data centers and
more of a longer term bull, like
basically less bullish on things when
you're applying that in the field,
especially in a non-controlled
environment. So not in a manufacturing
facility, but out in the real world.
>> And how is this making you think about
investing in AI? And I'll just throw a
few sectors out there. Obviously there's
the semiconductor chips um most notably
Nvidia there's the data center providers
that that build them concrete makers all
that sort of construction equipment
there is the cloud computing companies
Microsoft and Google Amazon as well
which are investing a ton of money but
they they have apparently demand for it
that is kind kind of locked up right
right now so it's slightly less
speculative than a company like Meta
which is investing just because they
think it's going to transform their
business which it very may will and then
there's the the the very speculative
which is open AI which is uh you know
losing billions and billions of dollars
and all that sector as well as China
Alibaba is a is is a leader there and
the Chinese model has pretty impressive
AI with way fewer investment way way
cheaper chips and the like. So just that
entire segment,
how what's a bubble? What's not a
bubble? Which do you like? Which do you
think is over overhyped or just avoid it
all? What do you think?
>> Good questions. I mean I I've been at
times long and bullish on the
chipmakers. Other times pull back when
when they get I in my view over their
skis. Uh I the short is I tend to like
these profitable areas. So the
chipmakers have been profitable for the
most part. And I've also I mean I've
been for example long Alphabet even
though there were early concerns that
they might actually get disrupted by AI.
I've been on the camp that they're that
I think they're pretty well positioned
there. Obviously I monitor it closely.
There are a couple reasons for that. One
is that AI was mostly disrupting like
nonprofitable types of searches, right?
So if I want to if I want to look up
what was Napoleon what was Napoleon's
wife name, right? That's something that
Google or AI could tell me the answer
and Google's not going to make money
selling me something. based on that me
looking that up. It's just a fact I want
to know. Whereas if I look up plumbers
near me, Google very much wants to have
that business. Um, and AI in many cases
was disrupting kind of the former. Uh,
it's a it's a super useful search
engine. It makes search way better in
many cases, sometimes worse, but often
better, but it's not really disrupting
Google's kind of core ad business in
that sense. They've also been one of the
leading players in AI kind of they don't
get as much obviously focus as as Open
AI does, but they've had they've had
kind of a leading position there.
They've obviously got a lot of
profitable firepower to to back it up.
And that also my view is that AI and and
basically makes video generation uh less
expensive. I think we're going to
continue to see a growth of video
content and Alphabet owns the biggest
along with Tik Tok. YouTube is like the
biggest video platform out there.
They've actually been taking pretty
decent market share in paid video, but
even just like amateur creation, I mean,
people use AI to do podcasts, like edit
podcasts. They use AI to translate
things. They use AI to help with
graphics. Those higher bandwidth types
of things are historically expensive. AI
can compress the cost of doing so, which
makes more of them. And if you run the
biggest platform that that benefits from
them as long as you don't get heavily
disrupted elsewhere, it's interesting.
So now Alphabet might be a little bit
richly priced, but I I I tend to fade
the most bearish narratives on it. Uh so
one of the ways I I take this is I I
first I ask things like what benefits
from AI, obviously chipmakers and things
like that, but then I also say what is
not disrupted by by AI but is cheap. So
it's kind of like an flipping the
question around. So one of my answers
was was alphabet. Also for example MIT
did some study. I believe it was MIT and
they released it and they kind of showed
how kind of small the ratio now of
corporate trials for AI have kind of had
firm results where they can say yes this
saved us money or boosted our quality.
It was it's kind of like a pretty low
percentage of of AI trials did that.
Even though obviously in the consumer
level most of us use AI now and we say
obviously yes it it it transformed a lot
of the way we do things. when you try to
apply it to a bigger setting, there's
more frictions for doing it and they
they have harder to say yes, this saved
us money here and there and but one
thing they did find is that AI was very
helpful on the back end. And so one
thing I I look at is like kind of
regulated or monopoly type of businesses
that can use AI to lower their cost on
their back end but that are protected on
it on their front end. So for example,
banks or insurance companies. These are
these are kind of in some sense capital
intensive, not in the physical way, but
in the in the way that obviously you
need big balance sheets to do them. They
often are operated
sections of the economy. They've got
back-end expenses that are some
percentage of that is automatable and
yet their core service is actually
pretty challenging to disrupt. And to
the extent that they are gradually
disrupted, things like stable coins that
that I'm I'm long-term bullish on, many
of them can integrate those into them.
So, I I I approach it both from what can
benefit and what is likely not going to
be either impaired or impaired as
heavily as pricing would imply.
>> And what do you think about the
so-called neoclouds that buy a ton of
compute by by data centers and then rent
out the compute? So the core weaves of
the world, the nebuses of the world, and
I don't believe that's Iron's business
model, but and then there's the other
thing of former Bitcoin miners that are
now supplying all this electricity.
>> So the short answer is the part that
interested me there is the ones that
actually have the real resources, the
ones that have the basically the
property or the rights to to re like
lowcost structurally lowcost energy for
example that then incorporate that into
their data center business because
that's where I think the competitive
mode is. I think energy is actually one
of the the biggest moes here. And so
kind of like how in in finance if you
have access to the money transmitter
licenses and all the regulatory stuff
that's a very expensive and hard to a
sale position compared to ones that are
kind of renting that from others and
using them in some way. I view similar
with with data centers which is the ones
that have kind of the root hard to
replace thing I'm pretty constructive
on. That would include a lot of those
former Bitcoin miners or ones that are
in many cases still mining but have
shifted more and more of their business
toward AI. Many of them at least the
ones that I think are interesting are
the ones that actually kind of have kind
of structural access to that lower cost
energy. Whereas those that are just kind
of using that ability temporarily that
can come and go. And I'm not probably
the best person to ask on that but I can
basically say where I'm interested which
is those that have the kind of the the
harder to replace resources.
>> So you like that space. You're also, I
imagine, a bull on natural gas and
power.
>> Yes. Yeah. Natural gas power. Uh the the
businesses that even get that natural
gas to where it has to go. Uh I think
all all that infrastructure is is super
interesting and and the resource itself.
And we've had obviously we've had this
long stretch where natural gas was kind
of cheap relative to oil in terms of
when you price it based on its energy
content. Uh in large part because
natural gas is less funible than oil.
it's easier to to move oil around to to
solve really big pricing gaps. Whereas
natural gas, it's obviously much more
infrastructure intensive to to move it.
And so those gaps are are much slower
and more costly to arbitrage. And so
we've had this really long stretch. And
I think over time that closes that
natural gas kind of gets priced where it
should be, which is generally higher.
And natural gas kind of assets I think
are are obviously very well positioned.

Now back to the interview. Thank you,
Lyn. Now to to switch tax entirely. Uh,
as I promised at the beginning, what's
your current view of the Fed's balance
sheet and its role in managing
liquidity? In late October, we saw some
pretty significant spreads of 10 20
basis points secured overnight financing
rate above where it should be,
indicating that the Federal Reserve was
beginning to lose control of of interest
rates. What's your view there and its
consequences?
>> So far, this is going roughly what even
the Fed themselves thought it was going
to do. So, they they the New York Fed
released reports over the past couple
years like annually where they kind of
predicted what their balance sheet's
going to do and they kind of saw it
gradually slow like the the decrease in
the balance sheet slowing down by late
2025, maybe early 2026 and then from
there growing in line with nominal GDP.
that that's kind of how they've roughly
seen it going. Uh and we are running
into liquidity frictions roughly where
they already anticipated that their
their pivot is likely to be. And now
that's a pretty big window because they
they weren't sure exactly where it would
happen. They had kind of loose estimates
for where it might happen. They have
that framework of scarce reserves, ample
reserves, and abundant reserves.
Overall, this this hit a little bit, I
think, earlier than expected in the
sense that we're kind of comfortably in
ample reserves. the way that they
estimated and yet some of this activity
points more towards scarce reserves. So
perhaps a little bit sooner than they
expected, but nothing particularly
shocking and that's also why they have
these standing facilities in place, the
standing repo facility and reverse repo
because they've learned from the
September 20 2019 repo spike. Um they've
already got these facilities in place.
They basically structurally like
permanently increase the funggeability
between cash, treasuries, agencies.
These things are all pretty swappable
without kind of major crises happening.
And so, and I think part of the reason
why this happened a little earlier than
expected is because of the TGA. And I'm
not the first person to say that, which
is that partially because of the
government shutdown, they overfilled the
Treasury General account. So, they were
targeting 850 billion. They temporarily
overfilled it to over 950 billion. And
when when they do that, that basically
sucks capital out of the financial
system and into a void. Uh and so the
more capital they have in that void, the
less capital there is elsewhere, more
less liquidity, I should say, that there
is elsewhere. And so I think over time
they're going to push some of that back
in, but that we are we are roughly
running into not only stopping the the
QT, they've obviously reported that, but
that I do think in the first half of
next year, we're going to go back to
structurally increasing the balance
sheet. The a couple areas where this is
noteworthy
is that one, they're going to be likely
increasing the balance sheet when we
still have officially above target
inflation, which which complicates
certain types of discussions around it.
And two, we're going to be going back
likely to period of balance sheet
increases from a higher base in the
sense that prior to the global financial
crisis, the the monetary base would
gradually grow, but it was pretty small
relative to broad money because you had
a higher kind of fractional ratio. And
now you're going to kind of probably go
back to that environment of a gradually
increasing monetary base rather than
kind of the boom and bust you saw in the
QE and QT era. But that that whole thing
is a much higher percentage of nominal
GDP or of broad money supply. And of
course it's interest bearing in many
cases because that that's part of their
monetary policy toolkit to to maintain
interests where they want. So that
brings kind of political ramifications
basically paying out money to to banks.
And so it's kind of a more politically
fraught environment, but that very
little of this is actually surprising.
It's mostly just managing the details
like what quarter things happen in, what
speed things happen in, and I think
we're going to go back to a period of
gradual balance sheet increases. I see
people talking about their expectation
that quote unquote something's going to
break or we're going to get a really big
like ramp up in liquidity of some sort.
I I tend to fade that view. I think that
that we're going to get these little
kind of micro breakages that are already
kind of have facilities to address and
that those are kind of the warning signs
for them to go back to a very very kind
of mild longer term liquidity injection
>> and what are the consequences of this
environment where the Federal Reserve is
in a small way expanding its balance
sheet as compared to the past three
years three plus three years and over
where it's been shrinking its balance
sheet through quantitative tightening or
QT. So short answer is not a ton because
when they were decreasing their balance
sheet they were doing it in a period
where there there still was abundant
reserves and abundant liquidity because
you had a $2 trillion reverse repo
facility. So the overall kind of net
liquidity has basically been flat for 3
years like the base the base liquidity
was flat for like three years and
whenever it kind of got to the lower end
of its range. So, one one of those
periods was kind of March 2023, kind of
going into the regional bank crisis,
that was kind of a low point in its
range. This recent period, this kind of
TGA refill was another low point on its
range. When they get to the low point of
that range, that's when when they tend
to run into these frictions and have to
then kind of overshoot in the other
direction a little bit, but that when
you kind of zoom out, it's roughly been
flat for three years. And so, I think
that that what's noteworthy is I think
we're going to get out of that flat
absolute range. we're going to go to a
period of kind of structurally
increasing again. On average, generally
speaking, that that's better liquidity,
good for asset prices. Now, that's
complicated by the fact that obviously
AI and other things have already run in
asset prices. So, it's not necessary
expensive, crowded, unprofitable or even
profitable like in the Mag7's case in in
their view. It's more of like the things
that have been stagnating for a while, I
think, can start catching a bid once we
once we enter that period of balance
sheet increases, which we're not there
yet. So, I think kind of the the strains
and liquidity we've seen lately. It's
not shocking that some of these like
unprofitable kind of hyperrowth stocks
have been off pretty substantially off
their highs in many cases. It's not too
shocking that that Bitcoin has had a
little bit of a correction here. And I I
think that that kind of turmoil probably
continues for a period of time. But when
we get to 2026 and specifically whenever
we get to the phase where we're actually
going back to kind of a structural
increasing balance sheet, I think it's
on average supportive of those types of
assets. But with a caveat, of course,
it's it's one variable among many.
There's also what's happening with the
economy, what what's the Fed doing with
interest rates. But that's another thing
is that people often thought that they
couldn't go back to balance sheet
increases till they get rates to zero.
But that's not the case. the the balance
sheet was increasing before the global
financial crisis even when they had
positive interest rates. It's a
different environment now. Like I said,
it's a much bigger share of the economy
and and a bigger share of kind of the
money system than it was before. But
that basically the balance sheet and
interest rates are two very different
kind of levers going forward rather than
balance sheet expansion just being
something you do after you've already
kind of exhausted the interest rate
channel. So, I think we're going to
enter a period of structural balance
sheet increases while rates are not zero
and don't really have a reasonable
expectation of going to zero anytime
soon.
>> And the way that the Fed would explain
that is it's not quantitative easing of
large-scale expansion in order to ease
financial conditions. It's just
increasing the amount of reserves so
that the banks can function in the
regulatory regime that the Congress and
the Fed has has created for them. So,
that's I think how the Fed would explain
it. Yeah, they would describe it as a
technical issue less rather than a
monetary issue. I would take and it's
it's partially right. I would take some
issue with it because to the extent that
they're growing their balance sheet or
going to grow their balance sheet
forecast to grow their balance sheet
with nominal GDP, a problem of course is
that if the government is running
structurally large fiscal deficits that
directly affects nominal GDP and so you
kind of have that recursive function
where the Fed's balance sheet is the
speed with which they eventually start
going back to growing it. will partially
be dependent on what Congress and the
president are doing with spending, which
is it's just a structural thing that's
that's it's kind of an aspect of fiscal
dominance. is kind of part of the
nothing stops his train view that
whenever the Fed runs into some sort of
liquidity issue with these core systems.
So in inter interbank interfinancial
institutional lending or the treasury
market they're going to step in and like
the same day either with a standing
facility or some sort of decision based
on running into these liquidity kind of
guard rails and they're going to
accommodate and even if they it's the
case that part of the reason they need
to accommodate is because we're running
pretty big structural fiscal deficits.
So, we're still in a case where bank
lending is not particularly aggressive
right now. It's not like a rapid period
of loan creation. And instead, it's
still the case that that fiscal deficits
are fueling a lot. And the only pace we
really do see lending and and kind of
stuff is is that AI area. So, it's
really only the only two games in town,
fiscal deficits and AI capex.
>> Right. Lyn, you mentioned Bitcoin. The
the draw down is getting bigger from a
few months ago to now down 25% below
100,000. what's your outlook here? What
do you if anything is you think it's
driving this this decline?
>> So, it's it's funny. I think the the
bigger topic is the length of
consolidation more than the draw down
itself. Because, for example, even in
like the explosive 2017 bull run,
Bitcoin would have multiple 30%
corrections along the way and they'd be
the the kind of these brief violent dips
and then a explosion upward and another
really brief violent dip. So, Bitcoin
merely having a 25% 30% correction is
like a normal Tuesday historically for
Bitcoin. The the more interesting fact I
think is the fact that it's roughly flat
from a year ago. It's been kind of a
very noisy type of flat like often it
it's intraday it touched something like
75K back in April. It it's peaked at
over 125k. So, it's had a really big
range, but that range is roughly
centered around 100k for a year. And
that's more I think what bears people up
which is that when you look back two
three years Bitcoin's had incredible
runs but in this past year it's been a
really choppy volatile wave going
nowhere and that is of course very
uncomfortable for a lot of bulls. I
think a broader issue is when you look
at the full crypto space, I I think it's
completely almost completely exhausted
of narratives and I I've definely been a
bear on things other than Bitcoin and
stable coins at least in any sort of
like s like macro scale things and so I
think that there was the there was the
ICO period where it's like okay these
coins are going to make ICOs better and
then obviously that has all sorts of
regulatory issues and in general is not
there there then you know obviously NF s
and kind of various things like that.
There's DeFi for a while. These are all
these kind of narratives that would fuel
an entire cycle. Then it was literally
just meme coins. It was kind of the most
cynical narrative which is just it's
basically crossber digital gambling.
Then people even eventually kind of
fully saturate that and say okay they're
obviously most people who participate
that in are going to lose money and
there's really kind of no there there
for a lot of this. Now there obviously
something has to be on the back end of
stable coins. something has to be on the
back end of the handful of things that
that do have substance, but those are
pretty small tech rails. Those are not
multiundred billion dollar kind of
things. And so I think that it's
partially weighed down by the fact that
you have all this kind of baggage
throughout the space that really needs
to kind of gradually or in some cases
not gradually deflate and become
dimminimous while I think that that
Bitcoin and stable coins are still
structurally interesting. So my general
view is that I think we'll see higher
highs in 2026. I don't I don't have an
opinion if it's early 2026. I I tend to
air toward giving myself more time. So
let's say late 2026. I I genally try to
avoid giving price targets for Bitcoin
in 2025 when quartered into one. I would
say 150K as we only got to 12.
>> You said 2025. You meant 2026.
>> No, actually this one when I was
quartered like I'm talking retroactively
now. When I was cornered into saying
what I thought Bitcoin would do in 2025,
I'd say, well, you know, I think
anything under under the 150 would be
kind of disappointing, I wasn't giving
those really bullish price targets, but
we only got to like 125. So, we'll see
what happens in 2026. I don't think the
four-year having cycle is playing a
role. So, there's some people selling
just because they think that we're on
the four-year having cycle with the part
where you're kind of supposed to sell. I
think that's a narrative that'll be gone
next year. And it's mostly going to come
in my opinion down to liquidity and then
also how much of the AI thing is still
kind of sucking capital in that general
direction. So I think the over the over
the structural overhang of the broader
crypto space I think is going to be here
for a while. It's kind of a downward
variable kind of just pulling things. Uh
but that I do think that the liquidity
situation will improve next year and I
also do think that the AI narrative will
probably have lost some of its steam and
therefore kind of some of that capital
can shift back to to Bitcoin and
elsewhere.
>> And two big buyers this year and over
the past year as well ETFs as well as
now this year Bitcoin treasury companies
the the biggest one Micro Strategy. How
significant have those two bids been for
the market? And do you think that they
will continue to be a force of strong
buying in the future, both ETFs as well
as those those Bitcoin treasury
companies, or do you think that game is
kind of over?
>> So those were basically the two biggest
sources of demand this cycle, you know,
specifically kind of last year and this
year is the ETFs and the treasury
companies. So on one side you had those
accumulating pretty aggressively and the
other on the other side this you know
you had longerterm holders selling into
that strength which actually happens
kind of every cycle. So every time you
have like way new highs tons of
liquidity you do get that kind of it's
kind of like how a startup company you
know when early founders start to kind
of uh as as the asset gets more liquid
and tradable and and you know something
that was 5% of their net worth is now
50% of their net worth because it has so
much appreciation. they start to either
rebalance or upgrade their consumption
some matter some combination of those
and you get that kind of distribution of
coin. So you have buying of Bitcoin ETFs
and treasury companies selling from OGs
like the longerterm holders. There's
very limited kind of raw retail demand.
Although it's important to note that a
sizable chunk of the ETFs and the
treasury company demand is kind of
retail by proxy. It's both institutional
and retail demand for the asset but with
an intermediary in this case. They
either want levered Bitcoin or they want
Bitcoin in their brokerage account and
their 401k and their IRA and things like
that. So I think that when we look back,
we look over the next five plus years, I
don't think that bid is totally done.
Like I do think that there'll be
there'll be more pools of capital uh
including institutional pools of capital
that will likely allocate to Bitcoin but
I think the rate of change is probably
done in or at least it's seen its high
watermark in the sense that you know I
don't think three times MNAV for a
treasury company usually makes sense or
you know kind of the just the explosive
growth the big the black rocks Bitcoin
ETF was like their most successful
launch ever. I think that rate of growth
that was kind of like a lot of pent-up
demand happening at once. I think that
is now behind us. Now obviously we have
a correction and I think eventually we
find a bottoming go up but that that
goes up at a more gradual pace most
likely because it doesn't have that new
factor anymore. It's already been tried,
tested,
found its limitations and I think we
kind of it just becomes a more organic
structure rather than this kind of boom
bust. And and so so you're kind of
describing Bitcoin as an asset class
that is maturing. And as asset classes
mature, they get less volatile. They get
maybe a little less interesting. It's a
little more boring. Boring can be good.
But what do you think is going to be the
the new factor driving Bitcoin in 2026
and the the years going forward?
Obviously, you don't have a crystal
ball, but what are kind of your your top
few candidates for that?
>> Yeah, short answer, don't have a crystal
ball. I think the the the advantages for
Bitcoin next year, one is I think better
macro liquidity and two I think that the
ending of the 4-year having cycle
narrative will actually benefit Bitcoin
this time because I think right now it's
hurting it because like I mentioned
before people like it it peaked in
quarter 4 2013. It peaked in quarter 4
2017. It peaked in quarter 4 2021.
People are like well it's got to peak in
quarter 4 2025. And actually 2013, I'm
not sure if it's quarter four, but the
the last three were kind of quarter four
on that four-year cycle. So, there's
some selling pressure simply because of
the narrative that the cycle's over and
it's it's kind of a self-fulfilling
thing for a period of time. I think that
once B bit Bitcoin finds a bottom and
we're in a fresh year, I think that that
is when people kind of maybe realize
that if it's the case that it's not over
and people in some case have to buy back
in if they want to be on that train, uh
that I think is a a catalyst upside.
Now, whether that happens in the first
quarter of next year or maybe it's
already in or maybe it happens second
quarter, that's where I would not try to
guess. I I do expect that we'll see like
the lows in either either this quarter
or probably the first half of next year
and then I I do think we see higher
highs 2026 maybe 2027. I do think that
this this the whole cycle I think is
different now and the main reason for
that is that Bitcoin mining rewards so
new coins are a much smaller share than
they were in those prior cycles. And the
much bigger question is what what do you
have to do to price to pry coins out of
longerterm holders when you drive it it
up up enough they do regularly sell into
that liquidity into that strength. They
are at that point very overallocated and
people that bought 5 10 15 years ago
they have families now they have very
large percentage of the net worth in it
and they do distribute their coins and
that is by far the bigger factor than
the having in any sort of like fouryear
cycle. So I think that that breaking
that narrative is potentially one of the
bigger bullish catalysts over say 2026
and 2027. So the Bitcoin miners every
having cycle the amount of rewards they
get when they solve all these
mathematical puzzles is is cut in half
and as such for a while what like seven
eight years it's been a very tough
business to mine Bitcoin and I don't
know the exact number you can tell me
but you know unless unless you have
basically a supercomput it's
unprofitable to mine Bitcoin at at
current prices and maybe even 125,000 I
don't know but it's a very very tough
business who is going to be verifying
all the transactions if if no if if it's
not profitable to mine.
>> So the short answer is you need AS6. You
need application specific integrated
circuits to solve it. So it used to be
that you could do it with a CPU. Then
you needed a GPU and then you need
literally a specific device that is
manufactured only for this purpose.
That's the most efficient way to do
something with a very narrow scope which
is which is in this case Bitcoin mining.
There's still different types of miners
because there's like the there's the
really big ones that buy like the
expensive new miners like the new
equipment and they operate pretty big
data centers and they generally have
power purchase agreements where they say
to a power company give us your absolute
cheapest rate for electricity and in
exchange we'll be the first to shut off
anytime you have a a a shortage of any
type. So we're we're your most flexible
buyer in exchange. We want your best
rate. Whereas something like a hospital
says we don't care about your best rate.
We want always electricity to be on no
matter what. We want we want we're the
last customer you shut off. Right? So
the Bitcoin miners on the opposite end
of that spectrum. And that's that's
their business model. Then there's then
there's kind of the scrappier Bitcoin
miners that go out to like oil wells
where they have stranded natural gas
that they literally just light on fire.
They flare it and they say, "Well,
instead of lighting it on fire, let's
just put let's just have this little
cart full of Bitcoin miners on it,
attach it to that." When you add them
all up around the world, that's actually
a huge amount of spare energy. There's
actually multiple times more energies
worth of natural gas flared every year
than the entire Bitcoin network
currently consumes in terms of power.
And so those generally buy older
machines. They kind of buy secondhand
machines that those other miners no
longer find hyper competitive. So they
have less capex cost and it's more about
location and things like that. Um and
the way Bitcoin works is that there's a
difficulty adjustment. And so if it
becomes too unprofitable for too many of
these entities to mine, many of them
stop mining. They say, "Well, literally
we're we're losing money every time you
mine. So we're going to either not do
more capex and just slowly let what we
already have stop or if it gets bad
enough, we literally shut off our
machines." At that point, the Bitcoin
network slows down to some extent. The
most extreme one was when China banned
Bitcoin mining. Something like half the
network pretty quickly went offline. You
start to get slightly longer block time.
So instead of 10 minutes, it could end
up to 11 or 12 minutes. In severe cases
like that China ban, it could be 18
minutes. And then every 2 weeks or so,
specifically every 2016 blocks, there's
like a control loop that says, "Okay,
because mining speed is slower now,
we're going to make it easier to mine."
And that kind of rewards those that are
still kind of borderline profitable and
it actually makes them more profitable
for them. So you always kind of find
that equilibrium. And the short answer
is who in the long term who mines
Bitcoin is basically entities that can
find virtually free energy meaning that
it's stranded in some way. It's either
it's either stranded in terms of space,
meaning it's it's out there in like
North Dakota, like natural gas at an oil
well that's not enough natural gas to
build a pipeline and they're literally
going to light on fire and you say,
"Look, just give it give it to us for
one penny and and we'll we'll do it." Or
it's stranded in terms of time, meaning
that it's it's like solar or something
where it's it's it's on at noon. There's
not enough demand to use that all up.
So, you get like negative pricing. You
have to cretail it. And the Bitcoin
miner says, "Okay, we'll mine during the
daytime and we'll shut off at night."
And so I think that Bitcoin miners got
to fill in over time all those little
nooks and crannies and basically buy up
the the nearly free stranded energy and
use that for Bitcoin mining.
>> That's good to know about the easing
adjustment. How long does the easing
adjustment last?
>> It's permanent. So every two weeks
roughly specifically every 20 2016
blocks it it changes and then in two
more weeks it it keeps monitoring what's
happening and if there are still miners
shutting off and and just not mining
anymore then it makes a deeper
adjustment. On the other hand if that
prior adjustment worked and now blocks
are speeding up again it might then
increase the difficulty to some extent.
over over the long term because Bitcoin
has grown so much is it more updates
have been increasing the difficulty than
decreasing the difficulty. This is
actually kind of the key thing that
Satoshi solved because before this there
already were kind of these like systems
that have basically a decentralized
database and the biggest question was
how do you decentralize who adds the
next block of transactions to it and how
do you do it in a way that's doesn't get
kind of inflate at once if we apply
processing power how do we deal with
Moore's law and the answer was this
difficulty adjustment it says no matter
how good computing gets this the systems
own control loops says, "Nope. Anytime
you get faster than a new block every 10
minutes for like a consistent two-eek
period, you make it harder." Or in in
rare cases, when you get that kind of
pullback in price and an overall network
activity, you have miners over their
skis, blocks are slowing down, it kind
of kicks in and makes it easier. So the
the answer is it's permanent and at
least for that next twoe period and
every twoe period is like a fresh start
in terms of of monitoring it to make
sure that new blocks happen every 10
minutes on average.
This is this is good to know. I'm sure
you know a lot of coin fans watching
this like I can't believe Jack didn't
know this. Lynn has to educate him. But
yeah, I I didn't know this. Obviously, I
knew about the having. What about Okay,
so I just looked up there's almost 20
bill 20 million Bitcoin that have been
mined. 19.95 million Bitcoin and there's
only ever going to be what is it 21
million or 21 million?
>> 21.
>> Yeah, there's only ever going to be 21
million. What happen I think you can
know where I'm going with this. What
happens if the there needs to be net
easing in order to attract miners to do
the activity, but that net easing
increases the amount of Bitcoin supply.
And so what happens if you approach
approaching that cap that gap as we are,
but the then it would then that would
slow down like is it possible to get get
over 21 million?
>> No, but but you're touching on a on a
related question. So the way the
difficulty adjustment works, it doesn't
determine how many coins go out to
miners for solving the the the puzzle.
Uh it goes it basically is their cost
side. So no matter what happens, the
same number of coins get created per uh
having cycle. Uh that doesn't change
except for every four years when it
decreases. Uh and what changes is the
difficulty of the puzzle to get those
coins. So supply doesn't change only the
difficulty of getting that. And yeah,
over the long term, I think the question
you're actually getting to is is when
all or nearly all the Bitcoin are mined,
how do the miners get paid? Uh, and that
is primarily transaction fees. So, to
the extent that that people want to
transfer Bitcoin, miners get paid both
from new block rewards, new coins in
other words, and they get paid from,
let's say every block can have an
average of 3,000 transactions in it.
There's more nuance than that. It
depends. But like let's say 3,000 and
let's say 4,000 people want to be in the
next block. Well, the 3,000 highest
biders generally speaking are going to
get in that block and the other thousand
have to wait. And generally speaking,
the lower fee uh in a crowded
environment, your transaction is going
to take longer if it gets in at all. And
the more you pay, the the more quickly
you can get out. Um so if Bitcoin has
robust demand uh at some point in the
future, you know, 10 20 years from now
when block rewards are very tiny, uh
it'll be primarily relying on that
transaction fee. Whereas this this
period of kind of new coins being
created is kind of the bootstrapping
phase. Uh it's basically saying that
we're even even during periods of low
transaction fees, miners are still
getting paid with the new coins, but
that eventually becomes dimminimous. Uh
and it becomes almost all transaction
fees.
>> Okay. And what if we're in a world,
which we kind of are now, where a lot of
the Bitcoin is hodal, just kind of
hoarded in ETFs or in wallets that don't
really move that much, and Bitcoin is
less of a currency that kind of greases
the the wheels of commerce around the
world and more of a scene of a store of
value. So, what if there's very few
Bitcoin rewards because we're the having
gap is so extreme and everyone's
hodling. So, it's it's it's not good to
be a Bitcoin miner at all. Then what
happens?
>> Yeah. So that that point it would kind
of mean that just Bitcoin structurally
doesn't have that much demand because
the way that the the block size limit
works when you add up how many how much
let's say you know 3,000 uh transactions
per block or in some cases 4,000
depending on how tightly they compress
them. The the kind of the very like back
of the envelope number is that with
current block sizes you can get
something like 200 million transactions
per year in Bitcoin which for macro
people might notice is actually about
the same number as Fedwire. uh the
number of Fed wire transactions that
occur per year it's about 200 200
million and so there's 8 billion people
in the world roughly speaking 200
million like space for 200 million kind
of base layer transactions per year and
so if if roughly speaking if 20 million
people want to have one monthly
transaction that you that's that's
Bitcoin's block space uh any more than
that has to exist in higher layers
whether it's a financial layer like an
ETF
or whether it's a software layer like
the lightning network or charming ecash
or various kind of layer 2s that kind of
lock uh into that network. So I do think
that to the extent that either Bitcoin
is successful or unsuccessful most of
will be on those higher layers because
that's kind of a important part of
scaling and Bitcoin's failure mode in
that context is that in even in the
distant future let's say 10 20 years
from now if not even a few tens of
millions of people want to regularly
transact with it and actually take even
just even just simply taking custody of
it because that's a transaction. when
you when you buy coins on an exchange
and transfer them to your own wallet,
that's a transaction. So merely if if
tens of millions of people want to hold
Bitcoin and very occasionally sell or or
move it around in some capacity, that's
enough to support the fee network. And
then anything on top of that is
additional fees. So you'd have to have
structurally low demand for people that
want to hold any coins at all in order
to kind of achieve that kind of
persistent low fee environment. At that
point, because of the difficulty
adjustment, the network can still
function. And the key risk would be that
it'd be pretty low cost to censor it.
Government could come and say, "Oh, for
a billion dollars, we could just, you
know, kind of block all new
transactions." Like, we'll go ahead and
do that at that point. So, it kind of
lowers the the cost to attack it.
There's also kind of a difficulty loop
there, which is that if it's attacked in
some way in that sense, then the the
fees to send can spike and that can
actually rekindle more demand for people
that want to pay fees and use it because
they have to because it's kind of like
blocked and you need to encourage new
hash power to come onto the network to
help move your coins. So, there is
somewhat of a feedback loop there. But
the short answer is that the failure
mode would be structurally low demand.
And the numbers there are tiny. Like you
don't need billions of people using
Bitcoin for it to have a pretty robust
fee network. You only need tens of
millions that even just want to and
globally, not just in the US, globally
to want to occasionally take custody of
it, occasionally move it around,
occasionally open a lightning channel,
uh, and things like that.
>> And how many do we have now?
>> Roughly that number. I mean, right now
there is a there is a fee network. The
fees are are usually less than a dollar.
Some cases comfortably less than a
dollar to move it around. There's been
occasional spikes where it can cost $100
in in kind of these really brought a
brief windows to move Bitcoin. Um so it
does generate pretty substantial fee
network uh fee volume. I mean uh so the
numbers are there. I think to make it
comfortable, you'd probably want to at
least triple it from here. Uh so that
you always have a fee network that's a
little bit more robust. Ideally, you
want to see at least the equivalent of
like $5 fees for a given Bitcoin
transaction because if you have 200
million transactions a year times $5
equivalence, uh you start to get you get
kind of a persistently robust fee
network uh that's measured in in the
billions rather than the the hundreds of
millions.
>> Okay, thank you. So, you know, VA Visa
and Mastercard incredibly profitable
organizations. They're global payment
networks and they are just printing
money every single second taking taking
a fee as well, but they're not very
capital intensive at all. Their profit
margins are very high. Whereas the
Bitcoin miners, even now at, you know,
it's a high price. Obviously, it's it's
down, but it's it's a high price.
Certainly, when I was in college, it was
at $2,000, $3,000. Even at these prices,
it's still not super profitable or maybe
unprofitable to mine Bitcoin. And all
the Bitcoin miners are now going out to
sell their compute and their power to
data centers. So like is there a world
where Bitcoin is $90,000 or even $60,000
or $40,000 where it's profitable to mine
Bitcoin as the difficulty adjustment
gets gets higher and higher and higher
or does it require like Bitcoin to a
million? No, it can be profitable at the
current prices and it would just be a
case where the difficulty adjustment has
likely decreased somewhat uh to
basically find that equilibrium is
generally how it goes. Because it's
historically been a growth industry,
it's aired toward unprofitability. But
if it kind of if it transitions from a
growth industry to like a more steady
state, that equilibrium would drift
generally down toward profitability. So
you'd have some on the higher cost curve
that are kind of not quite profitable.
you have others that are quite
profitable and the middle would probably
be kind of like borderline profitable at
that phase is generally how I'd view it.
Now it the types of mining that can
shift to AI it it there's a thing
there's basically there's a couple
trade-offs there. One is obviously AI
data centers there's way more capex
there. They care way less about
electricity costs. They care more about
uptime and they care more about low
latency. So they want to be generally a
little bit closer to population centers.
uh they want to have pretty reliable
electricity and and they're willing to
pay for higher electricity in order to
make sure that all the all the equipment
they spend this crazy capex on is is
working as close to 24/7 as they can.
Bitcoin miners have opposite economics
where it's it's it's way less about
capex. It's way more about electricity
costs. They don't need to be near
population centers. If you find uh you
can be in the middle of North Dakota and
you're you're just as good as as
somewhere else, you generally want the
lowest electricity cost possible, which
generally means away from population
centers. And so I think that over time
these kind of more persistent ones end
up doing AI data centers and the the
kind of that rougher sort is what mines
Bitcoin. either ones that are ready to
shut off at a moment's notice, so they
only mine during the day and then they
shut off whenever you have kind of the
the peak power loads, or the ones that
go out to all these scrappy places in
the world. And ironically, some of the
scrappy ones are actually pretty big
companies because they accumulate
hundreds of sites, for example. So, it's
sometimes it is small miners, but other
times it just happens to be a large
entity that's doing that kind of scrappy
work. I think that's where Bitcoin
mining increasingly ends up is around
the edges. Ironically, that's I think a
good thing because it actually helps
decentralize mining. You don't want like
a bunch of really big data centers
mostly in one country doing all the
Bitcoin mining to the extent that
there's like a a river in Kenya and
they're mining Bitcoin there and there's
actually there's companies that do that.
Then there's like natural gas oil well
like oil and natural gas in North Dakota
and there's some mining there and then
there's maybe some in Texas there's some
large data centers but they're the weird
type that shuts off a couple times a
day. That's actually a pretty healthy
state for Bitcoin mining because it
means it's all it's all these little
pieces in all the little nooks and
crannies of the energy system around the
world.
>> And are you confident with your high
knowledge of finance and engineering and
Bitcoin? Are you confident that in 5,
10, 20, 30 years there won't be a
technical problem with Bitcoin? the
likes of which I don't know enough to to
kind of imagine, but I've I've tried to
sort of approach that of just the the
the incentives no longer working or you
think that Bitcoin is so beautifully and
crystally designed that it it's going to
be working forever.
>> Well, the short answer is always risk. I
I put in the same bucket as
communication protocols. So, what is the
chance that Ethernet is still highly
relevant 20 30 years from now? The
chance that USB is still very relevant.
the chance that simple mail transfer
protocol is still very relevant. I think
it kind of has achieved that communic
like network effect communication
protocol status. This one happens to be
kind of the communication protocol for
value. It's got that leading
self-reinforcing security and liquidity
network effect and its simplicity is
part of why it's so durable. So it's not
this overtuned thing. It's this kind of
really simple thing that other layers
and stuff can build on top of. Now what
could potentially disrupt it? One is if
there's just dimminimous demand for a
decentralized ledger like just
structurally now it's already you know
it's a $2 trillion network now a little
under today a little bit over in recent
months but that just if if we're having
this conversation 20 years from now
people like no I'd rather use a
completely centralized ledger there's
not even in a world of 8 billion people
there's not even 20 million that that
want to use that decentralized ledger
that's a failure mode for for Bitcoin in
the broader space the other one I think
is at least worth watching is quantum.
Now, at times I think that that
narrative gets overdone for Bitcoin, but
I do think it's it's worth watching. And
so, for examp I've I've spoken to some
of the people that that spend most of
their waking moments trying to make sure
that Bitcoin is prepared for the
potential emergence of of quantum that
is powerful enough to to crack some of
the signature types. The short answer is
that Bitcoin is upgradable to become
quantum hard, but that there are
trade-offs. So I mean basically quantum
resistant signature types use more space
and therefore they they more readily run
into some of those scaling things. You
might have to potentially increase the
block size and do a hard fork
potentially in in that environment. So
there are I can envision technical
hurdles that the that could test the
Bitcoin network and anything that is
non-invincible has a has a risk of of
being derailed in some way. So yeah, I
would put the risk at non nonzero. The
way I kind of look at it is I say, do I
think there's structural demand for it?
I think yes. It's basically
decentralized portable capital, which I
think especially in a world of fiscal
dominance and sovereign debt issues that
are only going to get worse over the
next 10, 20, 30 years. I think that's
valuable. And two, is it the best at
what it does? And I think it's
simplicity and size and security and
liquidity all point to yes. And then
just then the remaining questions are
what are the technical hurdles watching
quantum just watching overall things
like that to kind of look for those edge
case risks.
>> So I I I think I understand what you're
saying because uh you know I've heard
this argument made by Martin Skrey who's
uh been a noted shorteller of the the
quantum what he would call a bubble. Um,
I mean these companies have very anemic
revenue growth and uh there's there's a
lot of pie in the sky promises from CEO
as well as people who have been long
with stock and people been long with
stock have made a lot more money than I
have in quantum and probably a lot more
than Martin Skrey. But the argument is
that for Martin Skrey is that quantum
computing for literally anything that's
commercial companies wise, it's not
going to be 20 or 30 years or maybe even
longer before quantum is up to the
challenge. But that literally the only
problem that is, you know, financially
attractive for for that quantum
computing could solve is is solving
Bitcoin and maybe hacking Bitcoin. I
barely even know what that means. So
that's what you're referring to that
quantum computing probably if it's real
and um scalable and and can do something
commercial. One of the first few things
it would do is be able to maybe like
crack Bitcoin in a way that you know
Bitcoin's main value prop now is uh it
can't be hacked at all.
>> Yeah, that's one of the most potential
profitable use case for it. the actual
applications for quantum broader than
that have pretty severe limitations at
least in that sort of investable time
horizon. Now just because we had the
emergence of quantum wouldn't mean that
for example it can just press a button
and like bitcoin unravels. What it
generally means is that certain certain
transaction types become more vulnerable
than others. So generally speaking the
really early coins like Satoshi's coins
for example they are the most
vulnerable. They're kind of sitting
there as like a big quantum honeypot
saying, "Hey, you want to you want a
several billion dollars?" Then that
that's kind of like the canary in the
coal mine for if anyone has a quantum
computer of scale. Then there's steps
people can do to kind of like put put
the bulk of their coins in things that
are much harder to types of like types
of addresses that have not revealed the
even the public key yet. for example,
the more aggressive thing is if you if
you had a quantum computer so quickly
that it could could break a signature
type in that kind of 10-minute mining
window. That's that's the most severe
kind of attack because the going after
Satoshi coins you have all the time in
the world. They're just sitting there
and if you can get a powerful enough
quantum computer you could take them.
The next step is can you take coins from
anyone trying to transact? In which case
your quantum computer would have to be
super fast because you'd have to go in
there and while it's trying to be
transacted, you actually go and kind of
snipe it and take it. And if it does
start to reach these higher layers of
actually disrupting if there's a
provable case of Satoshi or some other
kind of coins that are sitting there
being taken, that's like a shot across
the bow that some of those potential
upgrades for Bitcoin probably should be
accelerated. Right now it's still in
that theory crafting phase where some
people are like, "Hey, quantum could be
a giant factor in three years." And then
the other other people like Martin are
are would say, "No, it's even in decades
we it might still not be. I don't know.
Right. There's there's this big debate
now. So when you have a big debate like
that, there's no action is what happens.
If there were to be some sort of early
kind of provable disruption, that's when
it probably radically encouraged the
incentives to say, "Okay, we have to
make sure the worst case scenarios don't
happen. Some of these upgrades and the
trade-offs that they come with are
probably heavily worth pursuing at that
point."
>> Do you think Satoshi was working with
the team or was just one person?
>> That's a good question. I I mean I the
person that posted on the forums I think
was most likely one person. There's
pretty kind of normal wake sleep cycles
and the way he used language. I I would
assume he probably had one or two people
that kind of knew who he was and maybe
helped. But short answer is I I don't
know. There's been a ton of work into
obviously trying to to find out who he
was or if it was a team. Generally
speaking, the way that the code was
released, it looks like a prototype. So
generally speaking in software you'll
you'll kind of prove something works but
then before you actually release it
you'll completely redo it. You'll you'll
clean it up. You'll make it modular. It
was released in that kind of like rushed
prototype non-modular way that's more
indicative of a either a person or a
very small team versus something that's
this kind of polished product that you'd
expect from a larger team.
>> So one person or a very small team.
Let's this person, whoever Satoshi is,
do you think they're still alive?
>> That's a good question. My my guess is
probably, but I I don't know. There's
obviously been some high-profile
candidates over the years. Some of them
have been disproven as being Satoshi. I
I really could go either way.
>> So, you don't think it's healthy?
>> There. So, there was evidence that he
was actively and it was Jameson Lop that
that did this at a conference. He was a
obviously a high contender for a while.
I think it's possible he knew who
Satoshi was or other he was like an
early helper in some sense he was
involved in dialogue some of his ideas
were kind of a precursor uh for what
happened like he he did reusable proofof
work token so he was involved in some
capacity whether he knew who Satoshi was
or Satoshi the evidence against it in
addition to some other things like time
zones and sleep wake cycles and stuff is
that Jameson Lop showed because Hal was
a runner and some of his data is public
and he was running while Satoshi was
posting.
>> So, at least it doesn't doesn't mean
that he can't possibly have been in some
way involved or known, but it means he
probably was not the person doing the
posting like the Satoshi as we as we
know him.
>> Wow. Okay. I heard from someone in the
know in crypto, a very smart person, you
know, like yourself. Um, and uh they
told me that it was Hal Finny and that a
lot of people in also in the no think
it's Hal Finny. Would you say that's
fair to say that among among informed
people like yourself, the top candidate
is Hal Finny? Would you say that's fair?
>> I would I would say that there's like
three or so candidates that for a long
time have been in the top running. He he
was one of the more credible. He was in
that kind of top tier of people who
credibly could be that it wouldn't be
shocking to find evidence that kind of
that that's kind of in the category he
was. The evidence that I point to that
Jameson Lot pointed out about the
running that is fairly new. that came
out something like two years ago.
>> So that was kind of like uh and the
reason of course it's even worth having
that at a conference is to your point
how was one of the leading speculative
candidates for who it might be. Now I
would I would point out that that's
that's not been without cost. For
example, his widow has been like
threatened in many in some cases because
they say well you have Satoshi's coins
or something like that. So there's
actually that's there there's a um a
responsible way of kind of speculating
about these things and other ways kind
of potentially a human cost that it that
speculation should kind of be done in a
conservative and and responsible way.
But yeah, he was a leading potential
candidate that I think later evidence
has kind of put some some back pressure
on. There's also details like you know
what programming language the different
candidates were familiar with compared
to what Bitcoin was written in. There's
all sorts of um factors that go into
this kind of speculation.
>> And the Satoshi wallet has never been
touched. So those Bitcoin have is that
accurate that they've they've remained
in there forever.
>> Uh yes. Now Satoshi sent very early
transactions including one to how many
that were kind of test transactions, but
apart from those kind of very tiny
numbers, they've not moved. Now, it's
technically the case that no one can
100% say these coins are Satoshi's
because they can't even say who Satoshi
is. But they can say that while Satoshi
was active, there was this really big
minor. Sometimes people call him Satoshi
to say that it's probably Satoshi, but
you can't prove it beyond a shadow of a
doubt. It seemed to mine in a way that
was supporting the network. So, whenever
he became too big of a share of the
mining, he would dial it back. And so he
was kind of mining a lot but not mining
any more than he kind of had to to help
bootstrap it. So for all intents and
purposes it was Satoshi. And yet those
coins have basically been just
completely dormant for the entire time.
There's speculation maybe Satoshi died.
Maybe he burned the private key. Maybe
he just quietly still has the private
key and had the discipline never to sell
this entire time. There's there's a
range of possibilities. Do
>> Yeah. I mean that that would to me
support the view that this person is
dead because if you had I don't know the
number 200,000 bitcoins that went from a
value of zero dollars to tens of
billions of dollars maybe hundreds of
billions of dollars that there's tens of
billions of dollars there's no way no
human being would be not be able to sell
unless they forgot their password or
something which is something I would do
but you know even the biggest bulls in
the world Michael Sailor yourself you're
you're a big bull not the biggest bull
in the world because you're you're very
um uh rational but but you know the
biggest foaming looking at the mouth
Bitcoin bulls from zero to 90,000 I
think they would would sell. So I I I
don't know.
>> I think yeah the only scenarios where
one is is could be someone whose
ideology was stronger than their
financial incentive. They would kind of
know that if they sold they have a
chance of pretty heavily damaging the
perception of their network. And so they
might say that the the the mission's
bigger than their gain. I think probably
the most likely scenario is that they're
either they either passed away or or
that they're still alive, but they made
the one-time decision to get rid of the
keys. It's easier in the first five
years when Bitcoin is not worth much to
make one really hard decision to just
get rid of your keys and you no longer
have that choice versus having to make
that choice every bull cycle. That's
obviously, to your point, a much harder
decision to do that as Bitcoin reaches
$100 and then $1,000 and then 10,000 and
100,000 over 15 plus years to never
sell. That's a much harder thing than
that one-time decision to get rid of
keys.
>> Wow. Well, I'm glad I'm glad we talked
about Bitcoin because I know you're
extremely interested in and you're very
involved with the community. So, because
my stuff is macro, I tend more actually
about macro, but I'm I'm glad we we
talked about this. Let's let's turn to
the other the other hard asset, gold.
It's unlike Bitcoin. Gold has is in a
very strong bull market. It's over 4,000
and has been so for a month.
What do you think's going on here? Why
is why is Bitcoin weak and gold is
strong?
>> Well, I've been a surprised bull on gold
because I've been structurally bullish
since 2018 and long. But if you would
have asked me last year, would we see
$4,000 gold in 2025? I'd say, well, I'd
love to, but it would not be my base
case. So, it certainly exceeded to the
upside. You don't really expect to move
that big in such an established asset. I
mean the short answer is I I do think
that we are kind of entering a more
multi-polar world where there's just
more interest in neutral reserve assets
like gold. So there's been some
sovereign buying. there's been some kind
of institutional realization that
nothing stops his train that these
fiscal deficits are going to be with
like at scale probably for 5 10 15 plus
years that this is like a just a new
environment for developed market
sovereigns and that in kind of this
increasingly kind of less globalizing
world there's there's just more risk of
confiscation of each other's sovereign
reserves and so there's more interested
in kind of having things local or having
things that can't be debased and can't
be just frozen with a stroke of a pen.
So, I think there's kind of rational
structural demand for gold and there's
kind of a release valve like it's just
it's been kind of slow and steady for a
while and then kind of came out, you
know, kind of more than even some of us
bulls would have guessed and then silver
and platinum played catch-up. My general
view is that over the next 5 10 years, I
mean, I I still think gold has more to
run. Like, I think it'll kind of
re-enter the the system in some just
larger capacity, but that when it's
whenever it's overbought to this degree,
I get nervous. So instead of instead of
trying to trade around it and like
selling all my position, I instead just
kind of manage expectations and say if
gold has a six or 12 month consolidation
from here, nobody should be nobody
should be surprised by that because of
how quickly it it it ran. And and to
your other point of question, why would
bit why would gold run and not Bitcoin?
I would say it's largely despite the the
stock market reaching new all-time
highs, it's largely been a riskoff
environment in the sense that as we
talked about earlier, everything outside
of AI has been fairly weak. And gold is
an asset that can do pretty well when
liquidity is not bad. And and for this
year, liquidity has not been bad, but
economic activity outside of AI has been
pretty weak. And so it's not shocking
that that gold gets a bid in that
environment. A whereas Bitcoin is more
grouped in with other types of kind of
risk on assets. In addition, especially
in a 12-month period, I mean, Bitcoin is
a tenth of the size of of gold as like a
market size. And now after the bull run,
probably less than 10%. And one-time
factors can move it. So, for example,
when when Trump run the election, the
market is saying, well, okay, now I have
to price in some non-zero chance of a
sovereign Bitcoin reserve. Now, we've
got to price in XYZ. And I in in
interviews in early 2025, I I faded the
idea of a sovereign Bitcoin reserve. My
view was I'd rather estimate price as
though it's not a thing and be surprised
at the upside then incorporate that into
my expectations and then be surprised
when it doesn't come. That ladder that
that's what happened so far. There's
been no movement there. So any sort of
like these kind of like euphoric
estimates that kind of people bought
Bitcoin for a year ago that has to kind
of work itself out of the system as kind
of the correct reasons to buy Bitcoin
reassert themselves, right? There's
there's kind of even a good asset can be
bought for the wrong reasons or with
wrong expectations. And so coins have to
get to holders that have the what I
would what I would argue more accurate
expectations and away from those that
bought for the wrong reasons for the
wrong kind of timelines and things like
that. So I think Bitcoin's been going
through this kind of like normalization
phase where we kind of get away from the
election bump that it enjoyed and back
toward what is it structurally doing or
not doing.
>> Right. So Lynn, you said that Bitcoin
mining companies have a way more opex
less capex then than data centers. But I
do think that in the maybe the the the
crypto bull market 2020 2021 there was a
lot of speculative activity in Bitcoin
mining like and there were loans that
were made collateralized by Nvidia
chips. This is something that we are
seeing now and there's a debate in in
the the stock market community about is
the appropriate weighted life for
depreciation appropriate. So Microsoft
and and Google and Amazon Meta are
depreciating these chips at 5 years, 7
years. What if the real life should be
two years? So actually the depreciation
expense should be way way higher which
is going to suck out of earnings. Do you
think that let's say the Jim Chenos
argument uh not talking about micro
strategy but talking about the the
depreciation argument do you think that
that argument is correct and that the
artificially long weighted average lives
of depreciation for these chips and data
centers is artificially boosting
earnings and if it if so could could end
disastrously.
>> So my intuition leads toward that yes
that those cycles are probably shorter
than they're current being accounted
for. I would generally leave that to the
experts that that have focused more time
on that. I will say that in Bitcoin
mining where where I have a more of an
example, there was a well-known critic
of Bitcoin that put forth estimates for
how short the supposed kind of capex
cycle is for those like how long the
lifetime was. I think he estimated like
like less than 18 months or something.
And it was like demonstratively false in
the Bitcoin mining space that if
anything, a lot of machines go five,
seven years because of that thing I
mentioned before where first they're
bought by these kind of big miners and
then after after two or three years when
they're no longer the best models, they
they go out on the secondary market to
those that are like getting natural gas
mining with them and stuff like that,
these kind of scrappier ones. And that
the full life cycle ended up being
longer than people thought. But that's a
that's inherently kind of scrappier type
of chip than GPUs. So from what from
what I understand from the industry,
they do burn out pretty quickly because
there's so much demand. Now I don't know
what happens when we reach more of a
steady state. Obviously things are way
different when you're in explosive
growth phase versus when you kind of
rationalize and get to a more steady
state. So maybe maybe they're shorter
now than accounting expects, but then
when the dust settles they lengthen
again perhaps. I I don't know. But I
would leave that to to them. I would say
that in the Bitcoin's case, the the
capex the cycles were actually longer
than some of the the bears said.
>> That's interesting. Again, I I don't
know what I'm talking about. But you
said that Bitcoin can kind of go off-rid
whereas these data center AI chips are
running all the time. That's why they
have to have liquid cooling because it
just gets so so hot in there. So Lynn,
I'm not going to ask you the question
and try and corner you and say, "When is
this AI bubble going to pop?" Because
that would be about share prices and
that's so hard to predict. I mean, it's
an interesting question. If you want to
give me an answer, I'd be delighted to
hear it. But maybe something a little
bit more tangible. When do you think the
turnover in AI capital expenditure is
going to be? And I I'll share what I
mean. Like it the capital expenditure on
telecom was higher in 98 than it was in
1997. Higher in 1999 than it was in
1998, higher in 2000 than in 1999. But
2000 was the peak and then it from it
went down from 2000 to 2001, then from
2001 to 2002. So that was the decline
and that coincided with the popping of
the dot bubble. Do do you have a sense
of how long this explosive growth is
going to be?
When might this thing roll over? Is it
going to be in six years? Is it going to
be in in six months? And how are you
what are your how are you thinking about
that question? What are what are your
inputs for that question? I think that
the share price and the capex are are
actually somewhat intertwined so that
they're not just two different things
because and an example of that is when
when Facebook kind of went quote unquote
all in on the metaverse even changed
their name to Meta was doing a lot of
capex on VR. I mean their share price
took a really big hit and and they kind
of had to to pivot. Basically the market
saying we don't love this. I think that
as long as the market loves it, these
really big AI companies will most likely
keep pretty aggressively pushing it. But
I do think that the the price probably
rolls over first and then capex. It's
it's quite pro it's quite possible that
we're in the rolled over phase for price
now. I again like you said that's super
hard to predict and so I I'm not going
to try to make that call but I do think
that in the next 12 months or so we we
could see the rollover in kind of the
for the price and then capex maybe
follows by a year or two that's if if I
had to give a base case it might be
something like that but that but that
wouldn't necessarily be like quote
unquote the forever like rollover that
could be kind of like how back when
Ethereum was using GPUs used to mine. So
in in say let's say 2017, Nvidia had
this really big boom and then it cooled
off, but that's now like a micro blip on
the Nvidia chart. Actually, that I I end
up trading that one at the time. I I
kind of bought into that dip and it
ended up selling too early, but it was
like a useful trade. I I think it it we
probably see one of those in that time
frame that I mentioned. I I don't have
super high confidence on the details,
but I it's not doesn't mean that it's
it's like over forever. It just means
that basically probably go through a
cooling cycle to see okay where is this
actually working where is this actually
have a chance of being profitable where
is this malinvestment
recalibrate from there and then probably
have another cycle for all I know. So I
I view it more as in terms of kind of an
intermediate kind of rollover rather
than trying to call like a gigattop some
sort of generational change in the whole
space because like I said I think that
it's real and I think that the amount of
capex over the next 5 10 15 years is
going to be immense. I just think it
won't be a straight line. I think it'll
have some sine wave to it. That's really
interesting, Lin that you think that
your base case could be that
like this is the top and that the share
prices are decline. Obviously, not the
perma top, but like the the top for this
cycle. That's really interesting to me.
I feel like if you have that view, isn't
it almost a necessary view, a following
view that you are bearish on the S&P
over the next year? Because as we agreed
upon in the beginning, this stock market
cycle is the AI cycle and this econom
economic cycle is the AI cycle.
>> The way I would phrase it is I it's not
that I expected a giant rollover, but I
think we could see a consolidation. So I
I think it could have a a flat year. I
think it could be up down 10%. That's
that's still pretty weak for the kind of
the recent trend in the S&P. And even
when you enter a kind of a gradual
rollover or a consolidation, uh that can
lead investors and companies to
scrutinize their spending more. So it
doesn't take necessary a crash like in
Meta's case or kind of a partial crash.
Just a period of kind of more weakness.
I mean, we've already seen credit
default swaps of some of these AI
related bonds. That's the that's an
early signal of the market saying, are
you are you guys sure about this? And
there's and that's even without a a
major draw down in in in kind of the
broad space. some individual names. So I
think you can see individual draw downs
overall kind of choppiness and just kind
of less stellar returns kind of like
what we saw in Bitcoin this year, right?
So it's it's down but it's really kind
of just a a volatile flat for the year.
November 2024 to November 25 you touch
100K and then you're still like now
below 100K is really choppy environment.
You could easily see something like that
with AI names where it's not it's not
the big crash that the all the bears
want, but that it's just the the the
rate of change and the euphoria is
behind itself and then all those
decisions get more scrutinized. Take a
breather, which again is different than
being like over and we already saw like
recently if you look at like the AMD
chart, the Nvidia chart, they had these
really big kind of pullbacks and then
new highs. So like and I I mean I was I
got into AMD in my research service when
it had that really big pullback got out
which probably proves to be too early
after like roughly a double and so the
like I these things happen they kind of
come and go in waves now so far the
waves have not been big enough that
aggregate has rolled over and the
question is can you get enough roll over
once but e even as kind of that
skeptical kind of near-term I I mean I
would be a potentially a buyer of of of
pullbacks on at least certain parts of
the market should we get it. So, I'm not
like a structural bear on this. I just
think that it's it's kind of near-term
pretty heated.
>> Interesting. But what but if that the
decline I I don't know if you gave
numbers on it, but the decline in these
uh AI stocks, let's call them, is is
going to cause a decline in capex. I
feel like then that is a reason to be
very bearish. like I I don't think if
capex next year is lower than this year,
I don't think the uh these AI stocks are
going to do well at all. I'm I'm
particularly thinking of Nvidia,
Broadcom and stuff and uh you know those
are those are a lot of the S&P.
>> I agree with you, but that that'd still
be tighter than what I said because I
think that it could potentially roll
over price-wise like in in this year
like in the next 6 12 months, but then
with a two-year delay potentially you
have capex also then start to struggle.
So, I I'd be surprised if capex
struggles in the next 12 months. Even
though I I do think that I think you
said six years or six months, I think
that it's probably somewhere in the
middle. I don't I think we'll see a
cooling probably well before six six
years is my expectation. I I do think
that maybe that two to threeyear time
frame is is reasonable, but again, a lot
of this is new. So, I mean, it's it's
like a opinion loosely held. that's what
I'm kind of willing to say now, but I am
regularly monitoring this type of thing.
And so I'd be kind of looking for signs
that I'm right or wrong and adjusting
rather than just saying here's my
opinion. I'm never going to change my
opinion and then see what happens.
>> I completely agree. Yeah, you can't be
fixed in in your your view. So Lynn, do
you think that AI is in a bubble? Do you
think the stock market is in a bubble?
If not in whole, in part?
>> I think it's in part. I think it's in
part a bubble but based on a real trend
that is that is worth trillions and that
will notably impact things over 5 10
plus years but that much like Nvidia was
in a kind of a local bubble in 2017
cooled off got into another bubble
cooled off got into another bubble I I
think that kind of the industry as a
whole is is a little bit bubbishious now
especially with some of these like
recursive deals between each other kind
of a little bit incestuous financing
going on signs not of a bottom That's
that's for sure. Bubbles tend to go on
longer than people think. So just
because you're in a bubble doesn't mean
you're at the top of the bubble. But
yeah, I do think that it's a it's a
crowded space that it will at some point
need a shakeout to say, okay, what what
percentage of this is real? What
percentage of this is just kind of along
for the ride and need and the fat needs
to be trimmed off. Any growth industry
needs to go through cycles like that.
Otherwise, it just goes to the moon.
Like it's just basically it needs kind
of that speculative froth where
someone's willing to finance. anytime
someone puts AI into a name if if it
gets financed that is not sustainable
that needs to get shaken off and then
say okay well that wasn't sustainable
but this pocket is and so kind of
capital gets a moment to recalibrate and
go toward what's actually working and so
I do think that I would be surprised not
to see some sort of consolidation or
shakeout in that kind of two to
threeyear period cool off to then
recalibrate and see what's okay what's
still growing what's still structural
what's real
>> yes I mean I just it seems to me like
that the CEOs of these giant trillion
dollar companies, they are so dedicated
to this project that they're just going
to spend as much money as they can as
quickly as possible. And uh you know,
their stock price is going to have to go
down a lot more than 20% for them to
stop doing that. And you know, no insult
to to uh anyone, but it's kind it's kind
of like you know, Michael Sailor is such
a believer in in Bitcoin. He is going to
be issuing stock and financing stuff,
raising money to buy as much Bitcoin as
possible. like hell hell or high water.
And I think it the same is true of these
tech CEOs. They're going to be giving
money to Nvidia and buying chips and
buying data centers, you know, and they
don't care about the the post on Twitter
showing Oracle CDS credits full swap.
Like they they don't care. Uh that's my
view.
>> I I do think it would take quite a bit
of pain to slow them down. And I I also
think that again going from growing to
flat is a big deal or going from growing
sharply to then growing mildly and all
the analysts kind of reducing their
estimates is a big deal. And I think
that's a more realistic deal than oh
like basically we have a giant capex
boom and then it turns out the next year
is like nominally lower by a substantial
amount. I think that kind of sharp
reversal to your point is very unlikely
because I think that so many CEOs view
this as structural existential. They're
not going to say, "Oh, our stock price
down 20%." Or, "Our our our bond
market's getting jittery. We're going to
complete change." They might come out
with a statement. We we want to clarify
we're pursuing profitable growth. We are
being responsible and maybe they say,
"Okay, we'll dial back our expectations
to some extent." That's a more realistic
scenario. The rate of change rolling
over and and things consolidating more
so than just a sharp reversal. At
least
>> that makes a lot of sense. And again,
people are pointing to the Oracle credit
default swap. Like that's true, but also
like Pimco did a deal with Blue Owl and
Facebook Meta and they made $2 billion
in a day by by funding this bond. So
there's so much money in the fixed
income world that is fee based as well
as uh carry, you know, profit, you know,
incentive based that um even if they are
bad deals, I don't know. I don't have
the like the it's happening. It's h
that's my view.
>> Yeah, I think for a while. Yeah, I
agree.
>> Yeah. Well, Lynn, thanks so much for
joining us on Monetary Matters. As
everyone knows, people can find you on
Twitter at Lyn Alden Contact. Your
website, Lyn Alden Investment Strategy
is fantastic. That's lynalden.com.
So, people know about your Twitter, your
research service. Tell us about Ego
Death Capital and what you're doing
there.
>> Sure. So I'm a general partner at Egoath
Capital and we are a series A and seed
investor in Bitcoin related startups. So
v the venture space building out some of
the rails that we discussed earlier. We
also some of some of our companies touch
stable coins, things like that. Not
really the broader crypto space, but
anything kind of related to Bitcoin,
moving money around, kind of focusing on
high utility, low speculation elements.
And that's kind of my appetite for for
the unprofitable investments, these
these long-term growth things. In public
markets, I tend to focus on profitable
companies. And in that private work is
when I kind of focus on these longer
term hyperrowth types of bets.
>> Well, that sounds great because if
there's one thing that crypto needs, it
is high utility, low speculation. So,
congrats on that. Thank you everyone for
