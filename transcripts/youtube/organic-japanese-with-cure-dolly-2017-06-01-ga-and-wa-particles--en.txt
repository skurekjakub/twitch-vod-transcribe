Hello, pretty peoples.
KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu.
I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa. In our
last lesson we learned about the
fundamental structure of the wa- and ga-particles as they work in sentences – the
logical ga structure and the
non-logical wa topic-comment structure.
Now that we are armed with that information, we can put it into action. If you look
around the Internet, you'll see
various different things: you'll read about
a differentiating function; you'll read
about marking new information as opposed
to old information in the way that 'a' and
'the' do in English; you'll read about
distinguishing one thing from other
things; and you'll read about throwing
emphasis forward from the particle or
backward from the particle onto what
comes before it. All of this information is
correct. However, it gives the impression
of a number of different random
functions that you just have to learn
connected with wa and ga. What we are
going to do today is look at the way
that all those functions are in fact
linked together and linked together by
the fundamental structures we studied
last week.
This is not going to make it possible
for you all at once
to use wa and ga correctly in every
case, because whole books have been
written on this subject and it is quite
subtle and complex at the more advanced
levels. But having a grasp of the 
fundamental principles and how they
apply will give you a strong head start
in being able to use them broadly
correctly from the beginning and fully
correctly as you become more and more advanced.
So, let's look at an English sentence
which functions very much like a
Japanese wa sentence. Here is the sentence: "Remember Yamada-kun?  A third ear is
growing in the middle of his head." Now,
this works very much like a wa
sentence. Actually the beginning, which is
equivalent to the wa statement, –
"Remember Yamada-kun?" – is a logical
question, but it's not really functioning
that way. In most cases you're not expecting an
answer here. What you're doing is saying
"Remember Yamada-kun?"
in order to set the topic, and this is
exactly equivalent to how a wa statement
works in Japanese. Now from this certain
other things naturally follow. First of
all, whether we say "Remember Yamada-kun?" or "Speaking of Yamada-kun" or "As
for Yamada-kun", the implication is that
the person listening to you knows who
Yamada-kun is. You can't really say
things like this if they're going to
come back to you and say, "Yamada-kun? I never heard of him." You are taking a
topic that is already known to the
listener and then adding some
information. So that is why we always
have to use wa if there's something that
we can assume a listener already knows.
If the listener doesn't already know
about it, we have to use ga. The next
thing that this statement is doing is
distinguishing Yamada-kun from other
people. We want to talk about
Yamada-kun. We don't want to talk about
Sakura-chan and we don't want to talk
about that strange fellow who is always
chewing gum. We are talking about
Yamada-kun. So this is the second function of the wa and again it flows from what
it is. It's a non-logical topic-marking
particle. So the wa-marked material is
something we already know
and we are distinguishing that something
from all the other things that we
already know that might possibly be the
case but aren't.  Another thing we have to
note is that while we wish to distinguish
Yamada-kun from other people,
Yamada-kun is not the important part
of what we have to say. The mere
existence of Yamada-kun is not a piece of
information. The information, the new
information, the important information is
what is happening to Yamada-kun. A
third ear is growing in the middle of
his head. So, the wa-particle distinguishes the
noun that it marks from all other
possibilities, but it throws the emphasis
forward onto what follows it. It's not
the topic itself that's important, it's what
we have to say about the topic that is
important. So here we have several
functions of wa, and they are all
clearly tied up with the way wa works
as the non-logical topic-marker of the
sentence. They're not a set of a random
different functions that wa just happens to possess and we just have to learn. They
are all logically connected with what
wa is and how wa works.
Right. Now let's take two Japanese
sentences and see how this applies.
"Mukashi mukashi hime ga imashita.
Hime wa utsukushikatta desu." – "Once upon a time there
was a princess. The princess was beautiful." Now, why do we use ga in the first
sentence? It's because the princess is
someone we don't yet know. We are
introducing her for the first time. She is
making her toujou, her appearance on the
stage. So we can't say, "Once upon a time
there was the princess," because we don't
know who the princess is. We have to say "a princess" and in Japanese we have to say
"hime ga".  In the second sentence we know who she is,
so in English she becomes "the
princess": "The princess was beautiful."
In Japanese we can now use wa: "Hime wa
utsukushikatta desu":  "The princess was beautiful."
Now, we can also note that in the first
sentence the thing of interest,
the important thing, is simply the
princess. The fact that she existed is
not amazing information: after all, if she
didn't exist what could she do?
The important information is the
princess, so the emphasis is thrown back
by ga onto the noun that it marks: the
princess. "Once upon a time a *princess*
existed." In the second sentence the
princess has become old news. We already
know there's a princess. Now what we want to know is something about her. So wa
throws the emphasis forward, not onto the
noun that it's marking but onto the
comment that follows the noun. Wa
distinguishes the noun from other
things, it tells us what it is we're
talking about, but then it throws the
emphasis forward onto the comment. What we need to note here is that these two
functions of wa and ga are not random functions
with no particular connection to each
other. They actually follow logically,
don't they? One from another. New
information is interesting information;
new information is the thing we are
actually telling someone. This is one
basis of human communication, and this is
the way that Japanese handles it. The
ga presents new information and throws
the emphasis onto the thing itself, the
thing we are just introducing. The wa
reminds us of an old topic and therefore
throws the emphasis onto the new thing
that we have to say about that topic. So
these two functions of wa and ga are
closely linked to each other and closely
linked to the fundamental structure of
how wa and ga work in the first place.
All right. Now we have the basic principles. 
We know the forces that are going to be
at work every time we see wa and ga.
But as I warned you in the beginning, it
not always completely simple. Some of the
textbooks and online sites will tell you
you can't really learn wa and ga: you
have to just work out what they mean by
experience. And that is half true and half
untrue. The true half is that you do need
experience to understand the finer
points. Japanese, like every language, has
subtleties and fine distinctions – 
otherwise there would be lots of things
it could not express. The untrue part of the statement is that
there are in fact basic principles you
can learn which are going to make all
the finer points much easier to
understand, and those are the principles
that I have just taught you.
Now, let's start introducing some of
those finer points. The first thing to
understand is that ga does not
necessarily mark new information. It can
also mark old information, but it will
always tend to throw the emphasis back onto the noun it's marking rather than
forward onto the statement we're making
about it. And the more unexpected the ga
is in a sentence, the more you would normally have been
expecting wa or nothing at all, the
stronger that emphasis becomes. So you
see, this is one very clear-cut example
of a case where experience is necessary.
You need to know what you are expecting
and how unexpected the ga actually is. I
should also note that while ga can mark
known information, wa cannot really
mark new information. Now, as for wa, up to now we have seen it sitting quietly at
the beginning of a sentence marking the
topic, but it won't always be behaving
quite as conveniently as that. 
In some cases, for example, we may see
more than one wa in a sentence. Let's
take an example of that:
"Africa wa lion wa iru kedo tora wa inai." Here we have three was in the same
sentence. What are they doing? Well, the
first one is the standard topic marker.
The topic of this sentence is Africa and
what follows is information about Africa.
We use wa for Africa because even
though Africa has not been mentioned
before, everyone knows what Africa is. So
what are those other two was doing? Are
they also topics or are they doing something else? Well, the answer is that they are
not the topic of the sentence, but they
are still doing the work that a topic
does. Normally they would be called
something like the wa of distinction:
they are distinguishing their subjects
from everything else, and this can work
rather like a 'but'. There is in fact a 'but'
in this sentence, the 'kedo', but the
wa underlines the distinction implied
by that 'but'. We could translate it into
English this way: "Speaking of Africa, 
lions, well, they exist, but tigers, they
don't exist." It's not perhaps the most
natural way to say it, but you understand
what's going on. In each case we are
separating out one subject from others
and particularly from *the* other. In this 
sentence wa is supplemented by a 'but',
but in many cases the use of wa where
we expect to find a ga – because usually
we would say "Lion ga iru, tora ga inai", wouldn't we?
The use of a wa where we would really expect to see a ga is clearly distinguishing
the noun marked by wa from other
possibilities, and in some cases not only
would we not have a 'but', we might not even have the rest of the sentence because
the wa in itself is sufficient to
exercise that differentiating function.
Let's take an example of that: "Ame wa  futteiru." Now, that's a very simple
sentence, but as I expect you know,
usually we say, "Ame ga futteiru" –
rain is falling – so under what
circumstances and why would we say
"Ame wa futteiru", and what would it imply?
Let's take a hypothetical case: You and
a friend are in Kyoto, and you're
watching the weather report, and it says
that it's going to snow in Tokyo. You
then go to Tokyo later that day and your
friend calls you on your keitai and says,
"How's the weather?" and you say, "Ame wa futteiru." What do you mean by that? If you
just said, "Ame ga futteiru," you would have
been saying "It's raining", but you said
"Ame wa futteiru," and the
implication of that is, "Well, as for
rain, that's falling" – in other words, "Rain
is falling, but something else isn't falling" –
"It is raining, but it isn't snowing the
way we thought it might be." Now it's quite
easy for you to interpret this sentence
because you're already familiar with the
fact that "Ame ga futteiru" is the
usual way of saying it. Every year we say
"Kotoshi mo yoroshiku onegaishimasu."
That means: "Once again this year, please
be good to me." If you were to say "Kotoshi wa
yoroshiku onegaishimasu," that would be a
very unfortunate choice of words. The
first one means: "This year once again
please be good to me," but "Kotoshi wa your
yoroshiku onegaishimasu" sounds as if you're saying: "This year please treat me well
and don't treat me the way you treated
me last year."
Wa will always have this kind of
differentiating emphasis to some extent,
but in a sentence where we were
expecting the inclusive particle mo but
we get the exclusive particle wa, the
emphasis is very strong. So, it requires
experience to understand what we were
expecting and how far the use of a
different particle differentiates from
the neutral kind of statement.
In other cases the main function of the wa
will be to throw that emphasis forward
onto what follows it. Experience and
context are what is needed to interpret
precisely what wa is doing in any given
case, but we also need to have these
basic principles in order to be able to
interpret correctly. One can learn by
pure experience, of course, but
understanding the principle certainly
makes it quicker, easier, and more
accurate. Please remember that the course
