Welcome back everyone. Today on the
Joseph Carlson show, we're getting close
to the end of 2025. We're getting
through it. And as investors, I believe
it's time that we should take a step
back and look at what's happened. We can
look at our portfolios. We can assess
the gains and losses, the winners, the
losers, our different strategies, and
compare and contrast them. I have two
portfolios. One of them is a little over
900,000. One of them is a bit over
400,000. It's $1.3 million invested in
the stock market, give or take. Now,
over the past 6 years, I've made around
$550,000 of gains purely from stocks.
And I've been able to talk to tens of
thousands of investors, hear lots of
strategies, lots of thoughts and
opinions. And seeing all of that and
considering where we are today has made
me convinced right now is the best day
to be an investor. There are specific
reasons that right now is better for
investors than it's ever been before,
and I want to go over them. So, in this
episode, we'll be taking a step back,
looking at our investing strategies, and
looking what I believe is the most
profitable path going forward from the
end of 2025. Now, of course, we have a
lot of other news to get to. For
example, we have a news article from the
Wall Street Journal that Visa Mastercard
reached a settlement with merchants to
lower fees. This is news that as
investors you may read and think is
bearish on Visa Mastercard. After all,
how could lowering fees be good for
those companies? To the contrary, this
news is actually good for Visa
Mastercard. We'll be going over why it's
a benefit to them. We have the news that
Trump is once again considering the
$2,000 tariff stimulus. We'll be going
over why a $2,000 stimulus would
directly benefit shareholders and
investors more than anyone else. Gene
Monster recently made a call that Apple
is going to be the best performing stock
over the next 6 months. We'll go over
why he's so bullish on Apple and why I
believe he's wrong. Wed Bush's Dan Ies
calls Meta a table pounder. We'll be
looking at his thesis for Meta today
after its recent selloff. One of my
favorite analysts, Mark Mahaney, gives
commentary on all of these stocks that
are selling off. The Door Dashes,
Duelingos, Pinterests, the stocks that
investors seem to not want to deal with
anymore. He has some thoughts on that
and gives investors a broader context of
what's going on. And then finally, we're
starting off early on the week. We have
the fail of the week, which in this case
is a bunch of employees from a union
that are upset about layoffs barging the
HR director, filming him, and trying to
harass him into giving them answers.
We'll be looking at all the footage at
the end of this episode. So, we have a
ton to get to in this episode, a lot to
go over. And before we jump in, as
always, I just have to mention a quick

going over a subject that I've wanted to
talk about for some time. And that is
that I believe that you're basically
being lied to. Now, you probably know
this because a lot of what you see
online, you know, is not reality. But I
believe the extent of which we're all
being deceived is pretty extreme. And
that's due to a lot of factors between
social media and the news. Social media
companies are based off of algorithms
and feeds. They almost never just give
you the the feed in a linear format by
datetime posted. All of it's driven by
what the social media company believes
will be the most engaging, which will
keep you around the longest on their
platform. We know this. We know these
companies are engagement driven. Part of
getting engagement means that you keep
people's attention. You first get their
attention and then you keep it. And as
humans, we're naturally more inclined to
listen to things and to be alerted to
things that we consider threatening.
things that are shocking, things that
are that seem like they could be
devastating or even things that seem
very negative, things that we should be
concerned about. Those drive engagement
more than positive things. So, social
media companies naturally tilt towards
displaying more shocking, controversial,
argumentative, negative things online.
And again, I assume most people
understand this, but while we're
pointing the finger, we also can't just
blame social media companies. After all,
it's all driven by humans as well. For
example, if I was to hypothetically
create two different video titles and
test them, AB, one of them says things
are really bad and one of them says
things are really good. The one that
says things are really bad will get more
clicks. It'll get more watch time. More
people go out of their way to look at
that video than the one that says things
are really good. Now, both of them will
get clicks. Both of them will get
engagement. But if one of them gets 30%
more clicks than the other, if it just
has a marginal more interest and
engagement than the other, that tells me
as a content creator, make more of that,
make less of this. And that's in a one
video AB test. Now, imagine a platform
where that's the same type of test that
you can do across the entire platform
across millions and millions of content
creators of all different categories in
politics and finance and news. If all of
it gets a bit more engagement when it's
tilted negative instead of neutral or
positive, you can see the ongoing
impacts of it. This leads to a vicious
cycle where the news gets more and more
negative, where it becomes more
engagement hungry. The algorithms feed
this negativity. It rewards content
creators by posting negative things over
positive things. And it does this to a
huge extent when it's compounded over
years and years. And I've seen that
happen for some time period. Right now,
I believe that young people in
particular, people my age and younger,
are seeing more negative news than
they've ever seen or humanity's ever
seen at scale than any other any other
demographic, any other generation. We
are seeing an enormous amount of
negativity in the world. We're seeing
bitter arguments and feuds and
everything that can be negative is being
inundated in people's feeds. If you're
not careful, if you're not extremely
selective and filtering, if you're not
on top of this stuff yourself, you'll
notice it in your feeds as well. There's
always something wrong. There's always
something big and disastrous happening.
There's always some problem to complain
about. You can see it just in the way
that people look at finance. There are
some real concerns that I'm sympathetic
about. For example, people being priced
out of homes. That's a real problem. Uh
people losing jobs, unemployment's
ticking up. That's a real problem as
well. I am sympathetic about people that
are impacted by this. Those are real
issues. But there's also a lot of good,
a lot of good that I don't believe is
accurately highlighted. And I don't
believe it's just being optimistic. I
believe that this good is rational. It's
real. And I want to highlight some of
the things that I believe put us in a
better situation today. that you as an
investor, even if you're just starting
out, even if you don't have really any
assets, that you as an investor today
have it better. You have bigger
opportunities. You have more opportunity
to create wealth today than anybody else
throughout any time throughout human
history. In fact, today is the best time
in existence to be an investor. And
there's a number of reasons why. One of
them is that the the way that we used to
create wealth, think about it, 50 years
ago, just the boomer generation, the way
that you were limited in creating wealth
was primarily through buying real
estate. In most cases, it was buying a
home. You could get a mortgage and homes
were affordable. So, that was one thing
that they had that we don't have now.
Homes are unaffordable. Uh 50 years ago,
homes were affordable. That's a big win
because land and homes are very valuable
over time, especially if you're in a
high population area that has a growing
population and low crime. You'll have
land go up like crazy when you have that
circumstance. But while that was a
benefit, there was many negatives and
drawbacks that they had to deal with
during those time periods. For one,
owning land is difficult to do. It's not
global. People from different countries,
people from different states can't
always buy land in the best places. It's
very geographically limited unless you
happen to live in those specific places
where buying land was a great deal. Uh
you were just left out of it. There
wasn't that much of an opportunity. The
other option was to invest in stocks.
Now thinking about it now, investing in
stocks is very easy, but 50 years ago,
investing in stocks was an entirely
different ballgame. Free trades were not
a thing. Trades were expensive. Going
back far enough, it cost up to $150 to
execute a trade. And that was $150 back
then, which would be even more expensive
because of inflation. So buying
individual stocks had a high barrier to
entry. Every single trade had fees
associated with it. Every single one. On
top of that, there wasn't really ETFs.
Those didn't exist. They weren't
popularized at that point. The thing
that people invested in were mutual
funds. Mutual funds that had high
expense ratios. In most cases, the
mutual funds had 2% fees associated with
them. So, your only investment at the
time was either to buy individual stocks
with $150 trades or mutual funds with 2%
fees or even mutual funds that had those
fees plus the trading fees overall
making it very difficult. And on top of
that, there was also a lack of
education. People did not know enough
about the stock market 30 to 50 years
ago. And I know this because my dad
talks about it. My dad is 40 years older
than me. During his career, he talks
about how when he grew up, there was no
YouTube. There was no online education
freely available about learning about
stocks. He had no concept of what stocks
were in his mind. They were just highly
risky ticker symbols that nobody could
figure out that you really didn't know
what was going on. Uh they were
basically just akin to gambling. That's
all it was. You were gambling if you're
putting your money in the stock market.
And there wasn't a lot of education,
material, content, videos, podcasts to
be able to explain how stocks worked or
what they did. There also wasn't that
many freely available or cheap websites
like qual.com that could make it so you
could learn about a company after a
couple minutes that you could look
closely at the financials. They could
see the company's history visually
illustrated. The lack of education made
it incredibly difficult for investors to
actually understand the stock market.
Only very few of them did at the time.
Now we live in a time that's much
better. First of all, we no longer have
to deal with mutual funds. Now we have
ETFs with zero fees. They're essentially
zero. Some of them have 08%, but it's
day minimous. It's non-impactful to your
future. So you can go ahead and buy any
ETF at any point. And when you buy it,
you also have no trading fees. Most
standard brokerages now, in fact,
globally the majority of them do not
charge fees for trades. You can go in
and buy these companies at any point
with zero trading fees. They found out
different ways to monetize, but it does
not cost you money. And that is why
today I believe we are at the best point
throughout human history to be an
investor. And we have the most
opportunities to generate wealth on an
ongoing basis with the least amount of
work required than we've ever had
before. And I believe there's a lot of
things that play into this. First of
all, the stock market or the public
equity market is by far the best wealth
generation machine ever created by human
history. It just is. We have the tool,
the vehicle to generate wealth that's
better than anything else. It's better
than real estate. It's better than
buying land. It's better than all these
different various investments, buying
fine painting or signs, whatever that
may be. Having a public equity market
where you can buy compounding machines,
the best companies in the world that
generate cash on an ongoing basis on a
predictable and growing manner. These
are worldclass companies. They have
public oversight. They have audits on a
quarterly basis. They are regulated.
This is the best opportunity that we
have and it's very good. We also live in
a time period where we have multiple
massive points of innovation. We've
already gone through the internet boom,
but that's still playing out. The
internet is still a massive opportunity
to generate wealth. But then you layer
upon that internet. Now we have
artificial intelligence, LLMs. We have
tools creating massive amounts of
efficiencies. Then on top of that,
you're going to have robotics as the
next wave. We have a compounding effect
of long-term catalyst driving this
market higher, making it so that the
publicly traded companies, the vehicles
in which we can invest, can generate
higher margins, better earnings, and
faster revenue growth. And on top of
that, they also grow with inflation. So
we have the best investment vehicles in
the world that should continue to grow
for the next 5 to 10 years at a massive
rate. We even have another point that
you could add in which is taxes. Right
now the economy is geared towards
growth. It's geared towards
businessfriendly regulations and taxes
that will spur earnings growth, will
spur revenue growth over time. It'll
make it so companies can do more share
buybacks. They can invest more. they can
build out more infrastructure like a lot
of them are doing and grow their
earnings returning it back to the
shareholder. Every single thing that we
look at is extremely advantageous for
the time period that we live in. We have
an opportunity here to either complain
about things and again many of those
complaints are valid. Home prices uh you
know the job market goes through periods
where it's really good and really strong
or a little bit weaker. It's a bit
weaker today. uh we could complain about
those which again those are valid
complaints or we could look at the
opportunity today. If you're able to
hold down a job which I hope you are at
some point if you're able to hold down a
job you should look at today as the best
opportunity in your lifetime to invest.
You should be looking for every
opportunity to save some cash and put it
in the stock market. Invest in the best
companies in the world. Build half your
portfolio as an ETF. build it in the S&P
500 or whatever cheap fund that you
want. And then the other half, pick a
portfolio of concentrated positions and
high quality compounding machines, asset
light businesses with incredibly
predictable earnings with secular growth
trends. Buy a portfolio of these
companies. In most cases, you're going
to make a lot of money. We can see this
across my portfolios. You can look at my
portfolio, and one of them here is the
passive income portfolio. It's now a
$914,000
portfolio. 351,000 of that being gains.
What I've done with my portfolio is I've
simply invested in companies that I
believe have characteristics that are
very strong. They're companies that have
really good economics. They're super
profitable. They're very also steady and
predictable. And they're companies that
I believe have very wide modes. They're
difficult to compete with. And in
Qualrram, I can easily identify these
companies. So, I build concentrated
positions in them and then I just wait.
Patience and time is a big part of
investing in the stock market. But you'd
also have patience if you invested in
real estate. You wouldn't expect to have
a significant return in real estate
after only 3 months of owning it or 6
months of owning it. You would buy a
piece of real estate or a rental
property to make money for the next 10
years. And that's the way that I look at
my positions. When I look across my
portfolio, the majority of companies and
investments have done incredibly well.
Most of them have made significant gains
because again, I've kept to a very
simple philosophy. investing in
incredibly high quality companies. Some
of them, however, still don't work out.
Out of the 15 or so companies that I own
today, around two to three of them have
been subpar. And that's normal. That's
how investing works. Even if you were to
invest in the S&P 500 index, not every
company does well. Most of them do okay.
A lot of them make gains, but your gains
are primarily driven by a smaller number
of companies within your portfolio. I've
been fortunate with a lot of big winners
in this portfolio. You don't have to
reinvent the wheel or invest in
something super unique. I've invested in
many of what I consider to be the best
companies in the world. Amazon, Netflix,
Google, Microsoft, and S&P Global. The
one company today that's struggling is
Dualingo. We don't know how this is
going to turn out. So, the story is a
little bit untold, but the fundamentals
still remain very strong. Even with
Dualingo, this portfolio is up $65,000
year to date. Those gains and that money
will continue to compound even more. My
goal is to virtually double the value of
these portfolios every five years. So in
another five years, I'd like this one to
be roughly $900,000. By the end of five
years, I'd like this one to be almost $2
million. And to accomplish that, my goal
is to get an intrinsic return of 15% per
year. A 15% return per year gives you
about a double every 5 years. So, while
we look at our portfolios, whatever
stage of growth you're in, however long
you've been investing, even if your
portfolio is $5,000 or $10,000 or $10
million, the message should be the same.
As you're scrolling through your feeds,
as you're going through the Instagram
reals or the Tik Tok or the Twitter or
whatever it may be, you should look at
the news and understand that it's going
to always be tilted to the negative.
There's always going to be something to
complain about. There's always something
around the corner that looks really bad,
and that's the nature of humans. It's
just a game that we're never going to
fix. It's it's the way everything's
going to be. But don't be fooled by it.
Today is the best day to invest. Wealth
creation is incredibly possible and
probable if you take the steps to do it.
If you take responsibility to do it
yourself. Don't wait for anybody else.
Don't wait for permission from someone
else to do it. Just start. Start today.
Put money in your portfolios. Invest in
quality companies at reasonable
valuations. Invest in ETFs. invest in
high-quality companies, whatever it may
be, but get things going. And if you
already have it going, put on the gas.
Every single day, we have the
opportunity to log into our brokerage
and to buy shares of the best companies
in the world ran by the best founders in
the world. People like Mark Zuckerberg
with Meta Stock selling off today. We
have Uber with DAR leading this massive
network. We have Sundar Pachai with
Google, which is still at a good deal.
We have so many great opportunities
every single day to create wealth and
get further ahead in life. So, it's time
to get invested. Align yourself with
these great founders, with these great
executives that are growing wealth for
their shareholders. Get invested, stay
invested, don't listen to the naysayers.
If the stock market drops, it's a buying
opportunity, not a time to panic. Now,
let's go to move on to some news. We
have here the first news of the day,
which is a story from the Wall Street
Journal that says Visa and Mastercard
reach settlement with merchants to lower
fees. Now, if we look at how Visa and
Mastercard are reacting, we can just
take a look at the stock here. Uh, we'll
bring it up here on Qualrrim. We have
Visa uh right here. Visa's in the red.
While the rest of the market's in the
green, Visa's in the red. Um, we have
Mastercard here. We'll take a look at
that. Mastercard's also in the red. And
then we have uh AXP, which is American
Express. American Express is also in the
red. So, with the rest of the market
going up, with people getting excited
about the government shutdown
potentially stopping, we have the market
going up, but all of these companies are
in the red. This is because when you
first look at this news story, it's
difficult to interpret it other than
negative news. But this is positive
news. First of all, the Wall Street
Journal says that under the agreement,
the payment companies will lower credit
card interchange fees or fees that
stores pay to swipe cards by an average
of.1%.
So right there we have the first actual
point of data from this change. They
settled with the merchants to lower
fees. How could that be good for Visa,
Mastercard? These interchange fees do
not go back to Visa and Mastercard. They
go directly to the banks. So the banks
are actually the loser in this
situation. The merchants are the winner
and Visa, Mastercard dodge a bullet.
They don't really get hit by this at
all. They weren't making this money.
That was mostly directed towards the
bank. So they're not really losing out
on any money here. Then we look at the
next part of the story. Merchants will
also have more searchcharge options as
well as be able to decide which
categories of US credit cards they will
accept. Now this seems a little dicey.
They basically agreed to say, "Hey
merchants, you now have more control
over which type of cards you can accept.
For example, you could accept only debit
cards because they have a lower fee."
And you can say, "I'm not going to
accept this type of Visa card." Or, "I'm
going to accept Visa and Mastercard, but
I'm not going to accept American Express
or any of the the cards that have the
really high fees associated with them."
Now merchants have total flexibility and
control. And while it may feel good that
they have control, they really don't
have much control here and they really
don't have a lot of options. Almost
every single merchant invariably will
accept the higherend cars even if they
have higher fees. And the reason why is
it makes business sense. It makes
business sense to such an extent that
it's not even a really debatable
subject. For example, if you were to
break down which type of customer pays
with debit and which type of customer
pays with credit, you can almost put
them in two different buckets. And the
people that pay with credit make more
money. They are a higher income
consumer. They have higher salaried
jobs. They have more stability in their
work and they're higher spenders. So, if
you were to say, I want to save on
processing fees and I only want to
accept debit cards or these lower fee
cards and I don't want to accept credit
cards. as a business, you would be
saying all the wealthy people, all the
people that have stability, jobs, high
salaries, and consume a lot. I don't
want your business. I just want the
lower-end consumer, the consumer that
has less stability and less spending
power. That would be the decision the
business is making. Also, this type of
thing where you only accept a certain
segment of carts is also going to
frustrate your shoppers. Imagine a
different scenario where a shopper comes
into a grocery store or retail location.
They fill their entire cart with
merchandise. They go to check out, but
then you say that you don't accept
credit cards and they and they look at
their cart just full of $100 worth of
stuff and they go, "Okay, I guess I'm
just going to have to put this stuff
back on the shelf." What do you think
that business owner would immediately do
after seeing a customer put all that
merchandise back on the shelf? Because
you're not accepting a payment method
that is widely available elsewhere.
These type of changes cause enormous
frustration to the consumer. It adds
friction on the point of sale, which is
the last place that you want to add
friction. No retailer is going to tell
their best shoppers to take a hike. The
highest spend consumers, the ones with
the most money, that they don't want
their business. And if they do, that's
going to be at their own detriment. The
third reason why American Express,
Mastercard, and Visa should actually be
in the green after this news, not in the
red, is because not only did they not
lose in this case, they're not going to
be hurt by it, but it's also uncertainty
that's now taken off the table. They
finally settled an agreement and that
agreement could have gone much worse
than this. There could have been
outcomes that actually damaged these
companies, but the implemented solution
here. The remedy really won't affect
these companies. So, I believe American
Express, Visa, Mastercard should be in
the green after this news, not in the
red. Now, moving on, we also get to news
that Trump is once again floating around
an idea of giving $2,000 to most
Americans. A dividend of at least $2,000
a person, not including high-income
people. out of the group that will
benefit the most from a $2,000 per
person stimulus, the group that's not
given the stimulus will be the one that
benefits the most. They'll be the
biggest gainers from the stimulus. So,
even though it specifically says not
including high-income people, those are
the people that own assets and own
stocks, they're going to be the ones
that make the most money from a $2,000
stimulus. And the reasons behind this is
rather simple. When people are given
without any work or any effort a $2,000
deposit into their checking account, it
doesn't stay there for long. It will
inevitably get spent on either goods or
services. People eat at restaurants.
People go on vacation. People buy
products. They'll sign up for Netflix
subscriptions or YouTube TV. They'll
maybe buy YouTube Premium. There's all
different things that people do when
they're given money. Uh, a lot of it is
just spending it at different stores,
retail locations, goods and services
that work its way back into the stock
market. Almost immediately, a huge
portion of this money, potentially tens,
if not hundreds of billions of dollars,
would be given to people and then within
months, work its way into the earnings
results of companies, the net income.
All that money would be absorbed and
soaked back into the economy, back into
companies, and then back into
shareholders pockets within an order of
months. And that's the same type of
dynamic we saw with the COVID stimulus
checks. At first, it seemed like they
were just given as necessity. But of
course, when any broad range stimulus is
given, many people use it to spend on
goods and services they wouldn't
otherwise buy, boosting companies
earnings to record highs. So, this is
another thing that I believe will
benefit the stock market. Another way
this will benefit the stock market is
even if these people take the $2,000 and
choose to invest, they'll buy many of
the stocks that shareholders already
own, further bumping up the price. We
saw the same thing again during COVID.
Many people looked at their stimulus
check as an opportunity to buy more
stocks to bump up their portfolio, which
always works in the favor of existing
investors, ones that already have their
stakes, where these new buyers are
buying at higher prices. If this does
happen, the people that already own
stocks, the people that already have
portfolios will be the biggest
beneficiaries of it by far. Now, moving
on, we get to some news that Gene
Monster went on the CNBC and he has a a
rare call here, or at least one that I
don't see a lot of people making.
There's not that many people in my feeds
or around my circle of of the people
that I communicate with that are going
out on a limb and saying that Apple's
the best buy. Now, that was something
that I was doing a couple years ago. A
few years ago, Apple was at a much lower
valuation. I they're growing a lot
faster. I thought Apple was a fantastic
company and it was previously one of the
biggest positions in my portfolio, but
now I've largely trimmed out of my Apple
position. I don't hold much of it
anymore because it trades at a high
valuation and the growth has been a
little bit subpar. But here we have Gene
Monster as someone that continues to
pound the table for Apple. He's so
bullish on this company. Let's go ahead
and hear him out of why he thinks this
is the best buy over the next 6 months.
This I think is uh going to be the the
top performing mag 7 for the next three
months. It's it's a total sleeper here.
But effectively the bar is low for AI.
There's no question about that. If you
look at uh the cadence of uh what's
going on with the iPhone, the numbers
still need to come up for fiscal 26. And
most importantly is uh what's going to
happen probably in March or April time
frame with this new Siri. Uh if Apple
makes good, and they have a history of
making good on high quality products. If
they make good on what they have uh very
clearly described about their vision of
the next series, something that is AI
powered and personal and contextual, if
they deliver that, I think that that's
going to expand the multiple. And so I'm
in the camp there's a solid 20% upside
to Apple shares over the next 3 to 6
months. So there's his case for Apple.
If they truly make good on their
promises and they deliver an AI phone
and AI products, they're going to expand
the multiple. Now, when I look at Apple
today, this is a company that I love.
Again, I've I've had this one as a huge
holding in my portfolio. I've made a lot
of gains with Apple. Um, it's one that I
don't really hold right now because
there's a couple things that I think
Gene is leaving out. First of all,
expanding the multiple right now. It has
a 33 forward multiple. So, having the
thesis be reliant on multiple expansion
means that you believe it's going to go
to a 35, a 36 multiple. You're hoping
that it's going to go to the mid to
high30s Ford PE ratio. That's quite the
multiple expansion. When we look at
Apple, we also have a company where the
revenue has stayed mostly flat for the
past couple of years. It's grown four or
five% over a three-year period. I
believe out of the Mag 7, the two stocks
that will do the best over the next 3
months is going to be Google and Amazon.
Those companies I think are better
positioned. They have better multiples
to grow into and they have far better
revenue growth and earnings per share
growth potential. Now, another stock we
could look at is Meta. This is one that
Dan Ies has frequently talked about
here. He's on CNBC saying that this is a
table pounder. Let's go ahead and listen
to Dan IV's thoughts on Meta.
>> Look, I think Meta is a bit of an
outlier just because, you know,
obviously how dramatically more they're
going to spend on capex and what
happened to numbers going into next
year. But in my opinion, Meta is a table
pounder here and I think below 600
because it's my view, they're
transforming
this business over the coming years.
Zuckerberg right now wartime CEO. I get,
you know, fretting about everything
that's happening here, but this is an AI
arms race, but I continue to view it as
you want to see them spend because
you're talking about the the earnings
growth over the coming year is going to
be massive. That's why they're spending.
>> The market's not pricing in massive EPS
growth for Meta over the next couple of
years. In fact, next year, 2026, Wall
Street estimates are that Meta is going
to grow earnings between 12 to 14%.
Which would be a huge deceleration. So
that's part of the reason the stock is
going down is they're pricing in less
growth, more expenses, more advertising
all this capex spend and a capex spend
that's less predictable than Google
Cloud, Azure or AWS because Meta is a
bit more of a long shot. I agree right
now Meta is at a buy. I think the
company is at an attractive price. I
think Meta is going to have some issues
and short-term losses with their capex
spend, but that demand is going to be
filled over time. Now moving on, we get
to another interview. This time it's
from Mark Mahenny where he's asked about
Uber. He's asked about Duelingo. He's
asked about these companies where the
stock price is dropping like a rock.
It's going down because investors aren't
happy about the investments that they're
making. For example, Door Dash just
dropped because they announced they're
making significant investments in AVs.
They're trying to build out more
autonomous driving delivery. They're
trying to invest in that part of the
company because Door Dash believes
that's where things are headed and they
want to be in front of it. Dualingo
investors had very similar concerns. The
stock has sold down ever since their
earnings after the company basically
said that they're focusing less on
immediate profits and revenue growth
than they are the global opportunity of
a education platform. They're focusing
on teaching quality, the content quality
as well as keeping people engaged and
growing the users over short-term
conversions from the free tear to the
paid tear. Both of these have caused
these stocks to go down. And here's Mark
Mahenny's take on it.
>> You know, I I I'd spin it another way or
similar to what you just did, John.
investors don't like investment cycles.
Uh so I think that's the case with Meta,
Dash, Dualingo, Uber. I think there's a
few other names in there too. Maybe
Pinterest, you know, all those companies
that went into and out of this earning
cycle and sort of surprise negatively
surprised uh the market by saying we
really want to lean into investments
first. And I think Door Dash's, you
know, to me it's kind of like you just
can't be that surprised. They just
closed the deal with Deliveroo. they
bought the asset to invest in to to to
regrow it and yet the market didn't like
it and sold off the stock aggressively.
The good news though on a so that's that
to me is kind of the common theme here.
The good news is investors, yeah, you
don't want to buy a stock before they
announce the investment cycle. But if
you believe that it's a good investment
cycle, this is your clearing event. This
is your chance to get in on a stock.
Door Dash hasn't been one of my top
longs. It's been a long for us. Hasn't
been a top long, but you know, it's
something I got to seriously consider
now. You've got the bad news out of the
way. And what's happened, you know,
there's been some uh reports about uh
consumer flagging. You're not seeing it
from Door Dash. Uh you're not seeing it,
and by the way, in the travel names
either, Airbnb, I mean, the demand was
better than expected and intrinsically
strong across all the travel names that
I look at and for Door Dash, too. So, I
like Door Dash here. I understand the
investment cycle risk, but guess what?
That's behind us now. So he feels that
there's a reason all these companies are
going down. Whether it's Meta, Duelingo,
Door Dash, or Uber, all of them
announced increased investments into the
future growth of their business. Those
investments of course slow down
near-term profitability growth. When
investors hear that, they run for the
exits. They don't want companies that
are pouring money into investments that
may or may work out in the future. They
want companies leaning into profits
today. So investors are leaving these
companies. They're going into different
holdings. But he says that this is a
clearing event. It's a way for you to
get into these stocks or if you're
already in them to increase your
positions at better prices. That is
because there's one big concern already
being priced into the companies today.
They already know about the investments.
They already know about this cycle. Now
is a time to buy. In the past when this
has happened, when companies have said
that they're going to invest a lot,
that's like what happened to Amazon in
2022. All throughout 2022 and 2023 and
2024, Amazon stock price just went up
over and over again because the
investment cycle worked its way through.
If you don't buy in during the
investment cycle, during these
opportunities that the market hands you,
you may miss out on it. Now, moving on,
we get to our fail of the week. We start
things off with a fail of the week early
on a Monday. And we have here a group of
people. They're gathered around here, an
HR executive. So, that's the the head of
HR of the company. Then you have all
these employees gathered around. One of
them is filming them while a couple
others are berating them. Let's go ahead
and just take a look here.
>> Congregating here.
>> What counts as congregating?
>> I'm sorry.
>> What's your definition of congregating?
>> So everyone um you know we'd appreciate
if you would would go back to the
workplace where your
>> is there a place that you would be able
to speak to us?
>> Not today. We have other things going
on.
>> Do you think we're not worth speaking to
Sam?
>> Those are your words, not mine.
>> But they might be your beliefs.
>> They're not my beliefs.
>> Oh, okay.
everyone should go.
>> Okay, so right off the bat, we already
have a lot of hostility in this video.
If you didn't catch that, this employee
that's talking to the HR person says
something at the very beginning, which
is totally reasonable. Uh he says he
wants them to go back to their workplace
and this employee here asks, "Well, do
you have time to talk with us?" Totally
reasonable. That that's the right there.
That was something completely fine,
appropriate to say. But then it's what
immediately followed after that where it
went into hostility.
>> You would go back to the workplace where
your
>> is there a place that you would be able
to speak to us?
>> Not today. We have other things going
on.
>> Do you think we're not worth speaking
to, Sam?
>> Do you think we're not worth speaking
to, Sam? These are the loaded questions.
Right after that first sentence, which
was reasonable, he gave an answer
saying, "Not today." Instead of
following up and saying, "Can we
schedule a time a time set in stone
where you can speak to us?" Instead of
saying that, this employee says, "Are we
not worth speaking to, Sam?" Just a
loaded, hostile question right at the
beginning.
>> Those are your words, not mine.
>> But this answer is great. Those are your
words, not mine. Just throwing it right
back to the employee, saying, "Look, I'm
not buying into your loaded question.
You're saying that that doesn't reflect
how I feel." And then this employee
pushes back even harder, becoming more
hostile.
>> They might be your beliefs.
>> They're not my beliefs. Oh,
>> those might be your beliefs. Saying it
might be your beliefs. Now, now the
employee is reading the mind of the HR
person. Oh, even though you say that
those are my words, not yours. Uh, I'm
going to just say that those are your
beliefs. I know what you believe. Can
you imagine if the HR person did that?
Started asking loaded questions and
inferring people's beliefs.
>> Okay. So, you think we're
>> Everyone should go back to your
workplace.
>> I work I work here.
>> You dismiss us and don't talk to us.
>> You told us that we had to come work in
person here 4 days a week. This is our
microphone.
>> Dan, are you running away from him?
>> No, I'm
>> So then the employees are told, "Can you
can you please go back to your work
areas?" And then they say, "I work here.
I work here." Well, you don't work in
the hallway. That's not what they That's
not what he means. You're not working in
that hallway surrounding someone's desk.
Obviously, he means to get back to your
desks and do what you're getting paid to
do voluntarily. You're showing up to
work to get paid to do something. Go to
your desks and work. Uh, and then
instead of doing that, well, some of
them do. Granted, a number of them do.
They're like, "Okay, this is over. I'm
going to go back." But then a handful of
them choose to get out the cameras. You
have multiple cameras there. There's
another one here on screen. They get out
the cameras and follow the guy down the
hallway filming him in a private work
place, which if you're ever following
someone around filming them, that right
there is just one of the most obnoxious
things you could ever do to a person.
Following around and filming someone
that doesn't want to be filmed is not
only just wrong, but it's incredibly
obnoxious. You're almost always the bad
guy if you do that.
>> Directing you back to your place.
Okay. Where's my place?
>> If you could just go this way. You guys,
>> will you come this way with us?
>> No. No. I'm going to be I'm working.
>> Okay. Well, we have some quick
questions. You answered them. We'd be
happy to go back to our desks.
>> All right. We thank you
>> for you.
>> Thank you.
>> You don't want to answer any questions?
>> I've directed you back to your
workplace.
>> Is that Is that a good answer, guys?
>> Absolutely not. Come on,
>> S. Not a really good answer, Sam.
>> We're concerned about our colleagues.
We're concerned.
>> We're concerned about our company.
You're disengaging with the employees
who work here.
>> Did you like
>> What are you going to do to stand up to
the Trump administration?
Now, these employees are upset because
there's layoffs at the company, and that
is unfortunate. I sympathize with that.
I want everybody to be working and
making a lot of money, but this is not
the way to respond to layoffs, and it's
not a way to get ahead in life and get
higher pay and better jobs and better
treatment. The way to do that, if you
really want to twist the wrists of your
manager, if you really want to hold them
to task, just interview for different
positions at different companies. Get
offer letters that are more than what
you're currently making. send those
offer letters to your boss and say that
you would like them to reconsider their
salary hair because you have
opportunities where you're going to be
making more money. In almost every case,
they'll want to keep the employee that
other companies value more. If those
other companies that are competitors are
saying they'll pay this much, this
company will bump up their pay. I've
done it many times with my own job. You
interview for other positions, you get
job offers, and you leverage them for
higher pay. If the company's not willing
to pay you more, you simply bounce. You
need to have no loyalty to companies.
You don't need to like them. You don't
need to care about them. You can bounce.
But in the process, you should always,
always end on a good note. Never burn
bridges in the workplace. Jobs aren't
unlimited. And most people when they're
hiring employees have very long
memories. They'll remember working with
you. They'll remember if you burned a
bridge, and you may run into them in the
future because you're all working in the
same industry, typically in the same
location. Out of all the people that
this actually harmed, it harmed these
four employees the most. For that
reason, it is the fail of the week.
That's going to be it for this episode.
Hope you enjoyed.
