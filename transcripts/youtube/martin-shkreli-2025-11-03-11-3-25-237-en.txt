Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Yo. Yo.
Kapper has a new paper.
Yeah, I'm out of cure. I got out of cure
a while back after it went crazy.
Kind of felt like it went up too much. I
didn't even know they had I mean I guess
it's not surprising they had an FDA
meeting.
Yeah. I don't I mean I think maybe
they'll change their mind. I mean it's a
very weird situation. Um, but you know,
when a stock goes up so much so fast, I
I kind of unless it's really special, I
I tend to get out and I wanted to stick
to uh my quantum shorts. So, I basically
sold that immediately.
I'm really just short only.
Where's my P&L?
We're all talking about cure qur, which
is the topic. Dujour
FDA's decided that the cure data is not
good enough
to get approval on.
Dad life is good. Thank you. Excited to
see Septa's numbers. I think it'll be
good.
All right, let's see some quantum
bleeding here. I like this.
Oh, good for you, Andre.
Yeah, Huntington's has a pretty big
community. I don't know. I It kind of
feels like maybe it's a buy down here,
but I also feel like FDA is going to not
chicken out at some point. This is the
FCO trade. FDA always chickens out.
The Elon post didn't really make any
sense and obviously isn't helping these
stocks. So,
I mean, if Elon got into quantum
computing for some reason, that would be
very odd. And
yeah, I'm not sure what he'd want out of
that.
The FDA has been wild. You know, I kind
of like Biohaven.
Biohaven is kind of a
Oh man, I didn't get a chance to buy it.
That sucks. It was down like 20 30%.
You know, Biohaven is Cedar, not Sabber.
Sabber is that seems to be the only
place going crazy.
So,
I didn't study the extropic thing too
closely, but I'm very happy that Beth is
getting some time in the sun.
Elon said something about quantum on the
moon.
didn't really make too much sense.
[Music]
Yeah, I agree that the FDA is a bit of a
[ __ ] show.
You got Venet sitting there like I make
the rules around here. Me.
Topy's in.
Oh, topies in.
It's a lot of crazy posts on Twitter,
man.
Some Looney Tunes.
W general.
So, how do you guys know this stuff?
Secret Jamaican slang.
Uh, it's hard to say if you know how
much of a bubble we're in. And I think
we're we're obviously in a bubble in
some stocks
like Joby and Olo and Quantum and stuff
like that, but you know, will will they
throw out the baby with the bathwater?
Yeah, it feels like the FDA is very much
uh capricious right now. A little
shambolic to use one executive's
favorite word. But what are we going to
do? You know, this is part of biotech
investing. This is why you're always
going to kind of have to keep it on you
as they say where I'm from. When that
stock doubled, it looked they looked
good. Looked good enough for approval. I
bought it. I sold it. Next question. I
feel like Victor Ortiz Floyd Mayweather
after Victor Ortiz
accusing him of hitting him with a dirty
shot. That's all she wrote.
Touch gloves.
Just protect yourself at all times.
Boom. Boom. That's all she wrote.
But no, in all seriousness, Biohaven's
really exciting one. I've been talking
to a lot of people about Biohaven. We'll
we'll have to see,
you know, how how uh Exactly. You know,
but you know, that's ex uh you got it
exactly right, Josh. Josh knows, you
know, we're basically going back to a
time in FDA where it's double blind
placebo control trial or nothing else.
And I'm not sure that's a bad thing.
You know, it's it's certainly possible
that
we go back to that time and that's,
you know, not awful.
You know, I do think we're in a
different place from that FDA. So, if
you look back to 20 years ago,
guess I can
Was that Was that what did he beat Gash
and and then threw the threw the queen
into the crowd? That was like a rockstar
move right there.
Um that's Bonjovi.
Now the uh so the 90s
you know basically were dominated by
statins
orbs
at atypicals which are D2s.
These are the biggest classes of
medicine.
Then 2000s
you had TNF alpha
and then let let me sort of show what
the rare disease world was.
You had Gosh and the other
well yeah mostly Gosh there and then the
other ERTs
and then you started to get into
gene therapy especially for DMD and
other areas.
And so like if you think about like this
continuum,
let's see what else was big.
Some of these medicines needed
flexibility, some of them didn't. So the
FDA provided flexibility for some of
these things like Gosh, let's say I
don't know Musk uh let's see MS drugs
were were big in this era. Um,
I guess what I'm saying is that to go
back to a time where you need only RCTs
is feels off because
RCTs
make sense for populations that require
them. So, we could still do RCTs for PD1
and and GLP, but we're starting to get
to a point where I've said this many
times over the last 5 years.
We're in a period where
there's there's sort of vanishing
numbers of diseases. You know, the
amount of diseases left to treat has
become,
you know, fewer and fewer as like these
will never need new treatments in in in
practice,
right? Statins and ARBs
um are generic now as are D2s.
And so as time goes on, you know, a lot
of these drugs go generic.
Cystic fibrosis here and like cystic
fibrosis, there was a double blind RCT
that worked really well. Um for DMD,
there wasn't.
And then for SMA,
it depends. There were yeses and nos
there. But back in like P&H era,
you had you had,
you know, double blind placeboc
controlled studies. I'm trying to
remember what happened with Gosh.
I want to say there was not a double
blind placeboc controlled trial. So,
it's hard to discern a trend, I guess,
but it's it seems to me that going back
to an era of
prove it, you know, trials need to work,
period. No flexibility, no
interpretation.
The purist in me says that's not such a
bad thing. you know, we're running out
of diseases, so we're going after these
little diseases and we need to kind of
be flexible about them. I guess like you
look at AD
here didn't do much revenue, but kind of
a murky approval there. And each each
division of FDA has its own opinions
like Biohaven is at neuro which has like
traditionally been very forgiving
and then you had severed on top of this.
Ted Marsh resigned. When did Ted Marsh
resign?
Placed on leave.
What?
Personal conduct probe. Damn.
Wow. Long-standing vendetta against
Kevin Tang. I thought he worked for
Kevin Tang.
Yeah, I was I was busy repairing a
database and with my family yesterday.
That's wild.
What? So, what happened? He was the CEO
of La Hoya for Kevin.
data of falling out. When did he did he
resign as CEO of La Hoya? I think I
remember this.
He kind of [ __ ] up. Maybe didn't do
great at La Hoya. Did La Hoya get
acquired, by the way? I think it did. Is
it Orinia now? Oh, no.
Kevin's very successful.
Yeah, Philip, I don't know. I I
the RWE study did work technically.
My portfolio has been looking lately, so
I need to get back up to
need quantum to
hang in there.
He made some li LinkedIn post. I saw the
LinkedIn post.
Risk is tightening up.
Keep keep some powder dry.
What happened to Kapper? Somebody said
there was a
a paper, right?
Oh god,
Benitech had some news today. It looked
interesting.
quarterly earnings with Sera.
Okay. Is this another quantum head fake?
It goes down 5%. Start to pile in, feel
comfortable, and short again, and it
just gets smacked.
Cop news alert. Open AI. Amazon strike
$38 billion agreement for chat GPM maker
to use AWS.
Yeah,
it's pretty much my whole portfolio
short quantum. It's been
been an interesting ride.
Not a huge fan of bion tech, but
I don't know. Keep an open mind.
>> Yeah, I'm still on spruce. I did add a
little bit to it.
>> I don't I don't really trade government
bonds. That's not my thing.
Yeah, I haven't looked at the new paper
from Kapper, but I don't uh
I expect it's a lot like their other
[ __ ]
I'm not sure if did Marsh leaving affect
Serpa or not.
I mean, look, everything's obviously in
a bit of disarray.
The chickens are clucking.
FDA is running a muck.
What's going on?
The chickens are quite upset.
You know, this is why I wouldn't say I
don't miss drug development, but I would
say that like, man, it's a tough space,
especially rare diseases. But like, you
either have the goods. The thing about
drug development, I mean, you either
have, in my opinion, you like if you
don't have the nuts, poker talk, I
guess, for a second, you got to be
really careful about drug development
because it's like just the craziest risk
you're taking putting your
everything in, you know, is regulated in
FDA, right? There's no everything you do
is FDA has to bless it. And the FDA at
any moment can decide, "No, we're going
to do it this way or no, we're going to
do it that way." And,
you know, there's not much you can do.
You can't sue the FDA. I mean, it's it's
really hard to to beat them. Their
scientific opinion tops yours. So you
basically have to go in there with the
my view, the way I things is you try to
go in there with the most kind of like
conservative viewpoint you can because
if they,
you know, have this perspective that's
conservative, you have to deal with it.
Now, if you can get,
you know, a little bit of leeway, that's
great. But it's really hard to you can
see how my old company TV
is sort of handling this.
You know, I'm not really close to the
story anymore, but it it seems like
they've navigated it okay, but it's it's
one of these things where every medicine
has this question mark where it's it's
not exactly simple to
resolve every dispute and every question
about it. And
you know, I I really am kind of like
that old school believer of like either
you have like I would never want to be
UniCure or Surrepta as a company owner
um or company manager because it's like
you're going to FDA with a hat in hand,
right? You're saying please please let
me
let me uh get approval. And that's just,
you know, you don't want to ever be in
that position in life where you're sort
of begging and pleading. Now, somehow
Serpta got got away with it, you know,
partially because the, you know, really,
really tough disease. It's a,
you know, that sort of makes sense. You
know, these kids have this terrible
illness, but that's not what you want to
base your whole existence and company
on. like just
praying that the FDA sees it your way.
You want to deliver results that are
like, "Okay, we hit statistical
significance." You want the FDA to like
roll out the red carpet for you and be
like, "We're so proud of you guys. Way
to go. Way to make America look great."
That's the kind of thing you want. And
obviously medicine is messy and it
doesn't always work that way. But the
perspective has to be we didn't hit the
primary endpoint. It failed. It doesn't
work. And unfortunately the the problem
with that is that we've had this
slippery slope where it's like well you
know
you have to have compassion for for
patients. And if patients are saying we
want this but it doesn't work what do
you do? You know, it's a really tough
place to be where it's like I hear you
and it's this is kind of a political
partisan thing. Like if you're
think about it from the political
perspective, if you're dying and you
say, "I want a chance to live. I need
this drug. Go f yourself." You know, I I
Who are you to tell me what I can and
can't do to save my own life? Even if
this drug doesn't work, I want to take
it now. the FDA, the Democrats to some
extent, I hate to make this partisan,
but it is a bit of a partisan thing.
It's it's a liberty thing. The Democrats
say, "No, we know it's better for you,
and we know that this drug is dangerous.
We know better than you and your doctor,
and you know, sorry, not sorry, but
you're not getting this thing. And if
you want to get it, you can get get it
in a clinical trial. you know, why do we
we're not going to let you, you know,
take the risk of having it FDA approved
when we we can you can you can take it
just take it in a clinical trial. Now,
the company says, "Oh, we can't afford
to give you this drug in a clinical
trial because there's a lot of
costs that come with this. We need the
reward of an approval." And the FDA
says, "Sorry, you're not getting that
from us." Well, you can do all the
clinical trials you want. you know, that
type of dynamic is kind of the problem
that's at at the situation here. Because
ultimately, if you were um
if you were trying to uh do that for a
you know uh I don't know a uh an
Alzheimer's drug or a diabetes drug.
Maybe diabetes is better point than
Alzheimer's. you know, it's simple to
say, you know, go do go do another
trial. It's nobody's going to be
there's no problem with waiting.
Um, but if you have a disease for DMD or
Huntington's, look, my life is on the
line right now. You know, I I I can't
wait. Um, and the fact that these trials
can cost hundreds of millions of dollars
doesn't help, right?
So,
it's a really tough, you know, tough
place to be.
Yeah, we'll we'll do that soon.
Biggest cost in clinical trials is
recruitment, opening up trial sites and
paying patients and stuff like that.
Curado, I mean, I don't know what to do.
It feels like there's nothing to do
here. I mean I you could see it work
both ways. FDA is well within their
rights to say do a real phase three at
the same time. You got people dying and
uh of Huntington's. You got a brain
operation you have to do to do this
trial.
But if I'm FDA and I say listen I want
to I want to know that your drug works
and so you do a control group and we we
could take it from there you know and I
think that's quite reasonable.
So I I really don't know what to tell
you. you know, it's this really tough
tough position.
And I thought the, you know, the FDA has
historically been pretty forgiving in
situations like this. They're, you know,
pretty generous and,
you know, just would approve it. Um, but
I think, you know, clearly there's a
there's a move in the opposite
direction. I do think the FDA gets it
right on balance.
And again, it's a matter of perspective,
right? Right. I mean, you could if you
take the patient perspective here, this
drug should be approved. If you take the
scientific perspective here, the drug
should not be approved.
>> Oh, we're definitely doing it. Flood.
Trust. Just trust.
Trust. Trust. Trust. Hyperlid seems to
be taking over the world whether I like
it or not. So whether I like it or not
is irrelevant. But yeah, we are we are
on it.
Exactly. Kev Kev makes the point here,
which is, you know, our job is not to
gamble. You can gamble on any stock on
on the my front screen right now if you
want to. That's not what we do. We
we
are trying to be careful allocators of
capital.
I mean, you can you can sort of
try, you know, try to um
sit and wait and hope that FDA will
change its mind. I mean, that doesn't
sound great to me.
Now, if you have an edge on you follow
it really closely and you say, "No, the
FDA is definitely going to change their
mind." I mean, I don't want to be
involved in a soap opera.
you know, this isn't my I mean, if I was
running a hedge fund, I probably would,
you know, start to think about, okay,
how do I force this? How do I how do I
talk to the You want to really do
diligence on this. You go ahead and you
talk to
I would talk to
people in the Huntington's community,
try to rile them up, try to get them,
you know, if they're not riled up
already. How is the FDA saying no to
this?
Wage bloody war, bloody murder. You
know, we have to, you know, go to war
here for our our patients, our family
members, our loved ones. and you just go
go ham and you know now you're still
kind of gambling but it's a you know
it's a riskadjusted gamble and as I've
said before like it's a hundred plus
dollar stock if they got approval
you know the stock stalled out at 60s
something I sold it at like 50 something
to be honest and
you know that's where we're at
um you know it doubled so fast that you
know there was no reason to stay in
there other than
greed you know if you want the last $2
of every trade you you're ever going to
make. Like to me, that's I for me I
sold. I I thought there were better
trades out there. Um I don't blame you
if you stayed in, but you know, if you
stayed in with your whole portfolio, you
know, crazy uh overinvested, then don't
blame me. Um,
you know, I I still,
you know, kind of like the drug, but I I
think the FDA is well within its right
to take this perspective, which, you
know, you try not to go all in on
something unless it's bulletproof. And
even then, you don't know if it's going
to be bulletproof. Like, you look at
Aivvax, right, is kind of bulletproof,
but we don't know the patent situation
on AVAC. So, like, there's no perfect u
investment.
I think tenacity is way more important
than IQ in investing and in
well in investing it's sort of this like
uncommon common sense.
Um
IQ probably is a ne negative after
the right amount. I think you got to be
clever, but you certainly don't have to
be a genius or a math genius or
something like that. And I'm happy every
time I look at a math book and I I find
myself confused. I'm a little bit happy
because that means that I'm not a
genius. Uh at least, you know, on that
level, you know, that there are a lot of
people smarter than me. And I'm happy
for that because if you're too smart, I
think there are a lot of people in
investing who are, you know, they're too
smart for their own good. And I think,
you know, if you watch videos of Draen
Miller and stuff like that, no doubt
he's clever, but he probably is not
doing quantum physics. Um, business I
think is, you know, a mix of being
clever and perseverance, but I think
with both, you know, you start to have
diminishing returns and maybe even
negative returns after
120 IQ. I think you probably do want
those 20 extra points, but you probably
don't want 40 extra.
How to be a genius. Unfortunately,
you're either born with it or you're
not.
Um, when I say math, I don't mean uh
algebra or calculus. I mean real math.
differential topology some some [ __ ]
like that. See what do I got here?
Here we go. This thing metric spaces
coologies.
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. German farmer
common sense.
Yeah, I I have nothing to do today, so
I'll be up after the close and so forth.
All right, we're back to 300%. This
portfolio is
crazy volatile.
170K for me is
300%.
200K is 400%.
I don't know if the FDA will reverse the
cure decision. And it seems like they
would,
but you know, I could see them standing
tall, too. Standing on business. Maybe
I'll buy a little cure.
I don't know. I because I'm I'm also
dealing with, you guys know me well
enough that when I'm dealing with a
binary endpoint, I try to clear binary
event, I try to clear my portfolio and
just focus on that. And Capricorn is
coming up.
Yeah, the quantums have been very
volatile lately.
I'm happy they're down.
Yeah. Name here. I think that's right.
It's a bit of a coin flip that we have
no edge in. At the same time, the risk
award is pretty good. I mean, the FDA,
we're calling it FACO. FDA always
chickens out. You know, they've
chickenened out with Serupta.
And you know this government is quite
malleable relative to old ones where
like the FDA used to when they made a
decision that was it. You just could not
change their mind. Now you send some
people to DC, you bark on social media,
you know, slide me 50 G's. I'm kidding
about that. And before you know it,
you might get an approval. I might talk
to some people for you.
But
you know, that never used to happen. It
used to be
only uh
you had a rat's chance in hell for them
to reverse. People didn't even bother
appealing
me 50 racks.
Guess me 50 racks. You want approval?
It's all about 50 racks.
I don't know. CRBU. Sorry.
I just answered the question on cure
over and over and over and over again.
I think
it's probably 5050 maybe 60 70% FDA
reverses. So, it's probably a pretty
good long, you know. I just don't, you
know, gambling, you know.
Yes, I'm still in spruce.
Spruce moose.
No, 5% in spruce is okay.
Yeah, this is this today is why people
don't trade biotech.
This kind of thing. This is why people
say no mass. Everybody has to get hit
once
in biotech and you say, "You know what?
Maybe I'm good.
Maybe I don't need this [ __ ] in my
life."
I saw Scott Adams. I saw some people
trying to [ __ ] scam him with
ivormectton. I feel bad. What the [ __ ]
is wrong with these people?
Hey Chris
morning.
Yeah, Carazon, it really depends. I
mean, I think over the course of your
investing career, like you should know
these companies and stocks really well.
Like, I've probably spent 10,000 hours
just on Amgen. Morning.
And that's uh
maybe an understatement. So
you know that you know will that
knowledge help you every time? Probably
not. But I think the pattern recognition
and the kind of like feel that some
traders and investors have you get a
good feeling
from that experience.
Well, earnings week. There was a big
earnings week last week.
Uh that was uh interesting.
Very very interesting for the
hyperscalers especially.
Of course, we're live. We're live every
day.
There are dumb people on the internet.
That's one thing you got to come to
terms with. Not everyone on the
internet.
Is this live?
You You can look at the stock prices on
the screen if you really wanted to and
see if they're live or not.
to get this module on Goodell back up
and running. It's been down for a few
days.
I am almost done getting it back up, but
it was uh some security issue we had to
patch.
painful
less data because of the shutdown. I
don't know economic data.
I don't really care for economic data in
the first place.
I'm not a macro guy.
Macro macro man. You want to be a
macroman?
I don't.
Yeah, I'm mostly in this quantum trade,
you know, just waiting for quantum to
disappear. It's it's been a very
harrowing trade.
Um
you as you guys know who've been
following me or or you're in the trade
too many hedge funds in the trade as
well. You know it's beaten us all up so
much that so many people have been
had their portfolios shredded by this
thing. And I was talking to a hedge fun
manager last week. you know, we're both
in a very good position where we're both
short quantum and we both live to tell
about it, which you know, not everyone
has had that luxury and um you know, I'm
lucky because I have all these other
gains. I think he's in the same position
and so we just get we're just going to
get our quantum gains in you know, 2026.
Now, maybe we'll get them right now.
We'll see. The stocks are dropping. But
that kind of thing is is a you know in
some ways it's luck in some ways it's
skill but you know I have gains to give
away to quantum that I can get back
later and you know now up 302%
roughly this portfolio goes crazy
because the base is so small. So
when your base is that small, the
tiniest returns will amplify
because you're no longer running the
same amount.
If that makes sense.
Yeah, I'm going to stay long for sura
earnings. Yeah, I think they're going to
have good earnings. I mean, they there
there have been surveys. There have been
little indications here and there that,
you know, um SRP is in good shape.
Okay, quantum's now nicely here.
Starting to recover some of my
losses from last week. Last week was
really rough.
All it takes is one good week in quantum
to ruin your ruin your port portfolio.
Hey,
you missed a good family reunion.
It was good.
Top news alert. Graphic: tariffs, tacos,
and dollars. Global markets in a year of
Trump 2.9.
Yeah, jams. I I think you know we just
go through different eras. You know,
cassava was a unique era. Quantum is a
unique era. We'll be back and doing
other things soon. Spy flat, Nvidia up
and quantum getting decimated here along
with some other growth sectors. The
factor trade is mean reverting. you
know, quality had been vastly out
underperforming
and now quality is outperforming
and it blew out so hard. There was just
no way for quality to stay that low
and now we're seeing that, you know, we
took the pain on this quality trade. So
does so did Renaissance, by the way. And
quality is a factor. I think I've taught
you guys about factors, but if you
haven't, you can look at factor models
or factor investing or whatever. Um,
but yeah, each stock arguably is a
linear combination. The performance can
be explained by principal factors is
beta. And then, you know, you could sort
of factoriize
every other component of why the stock
is up or down. Could be because biotech
stocks in general are up or down. It
could be because
it's a US company and not a foreign
company. It could be because it has
exposure the company has exposure to uh
commodity prices. You know, there's
factors that explain virtually all of
the stock prices movement except for
of course
alpha. And alpha is sort of this
idiosyncratic thing that's whatever is
left over. Um
but yeah, big companies like
Unrequality, but it's more about like
low quality outperforming like companies
without revenue, companies with low um
low revenue. These are the stocks that
have been the winners, right? We always
joke like, "Oh, people want the safe
haven of heretti, the safe haven of some
of these dogs." Um,
they're not safe havens, but they've
been acting like it. Well, that that
factor has to mean revert. It can't go
up forever. you know, uh, if you look at
a graph of that factor over a really
long period of time, that factor has,
you know, blown out to epic proportions
and it has to come back down, you know,
unless we're in a new paradigm where
low, you know,
lowquality
companies somehow, you know, beat the
odds and all become high quality
companies, which, you know, the
likelihood is is practically zero.
Um, some of them will, but you know,
most of them won't. And
that's the kind of, you know, thing that
we've all spotted that something's wrong
with these stocks, something's wrong
with the market, right? And we've all
spotted that and we're trying to take
advantage of it and time it. There's
just like stock picks, factor picks are
no easier, you know, and like I said, if
you're short, you know, we've said this
so many times, but if you're short
Regetti, it's no different from being
short Ollo is no different from being
short Joby. And the fundamentals don't
matter. Fundamentals are it's a low
quality factor. That's what's driving
it. And people these days trade factors
more than they trade stocks, you know,
that's what quants do. Um,
so we'll add some factor tools to goell.
It's probably one of the bigger things
we're missing to be honest,
but you can guesstimate your own factors
and it's like that old Kramer
on the Kramer show used to have a
section called am I diversified?
And it was like regretti. Okay, Kramer,
my portfolio is Regetti, Ollo, Joby,
and Unicure. It's like, okay, you got a
biotech, you got quantum computing, you
got energy, and you got industrial EVT.
Well, yes, you're diversified. And like,
obviously, no, you're not diversified.
You're just long momentum.
Um,
you're ultra long momentum. So, you're
diversified if you have a mix of
momentum, value, and other things.
B. Riley downgraded Regetti. Wow, times
are changing. No more banking business
to do. They're like, "Listen, man.
You're going to do offering or not?"
Then they're like, "Listen, we don't
need the cash. I'm really sorry. We just
we just don't want to do an offering."
And Bley's like, "Downgrade that [ __ ]
Downgrade that [ __ ] right now.
I thought I was supposed to be an
impartial
impartial analyst."
I said, "Downgrade it. They're not
paying us. They're not paying you. We're
[ __ ] Downgrade the stock.
I'm just kidding. I know all these firms
have very
sophisticated Chinese walls. Banking
does not influence
the analysts opinions.
I'm sure those guys never talk to each
other.
They're not allowed to. So, how could
they talk to each other? It's against
the rules.
Okay. When something's against the
rules,
it doesn't happen.
Should I press quantum? I'm scared. I'm
scared. I've been too much of a victim
of quantum. I don't want to press it.
I have enough short exposure.
China number one.
Oh, China number one.
Yeah. You got a hold on my stock. I'm
never doing banking with you. [ __ ] out
of here. You couldn't even give me a a
little buy.
Yeah, these ratings don't really matter
much, but it's kind of like
the bank's way of saying thank you.
Where are the Koreans right now?
Our friends from Korea. Hung
Gay.
Nothing makes me happier that gay means
dog in Korean.
And it's like such an insult. You call
somebody a dog in Korean. I think it's
like
really disrespectful.
Some nice drops. Nice drop here. What do
I do? What do I do?
Yes.
I think Regetti is still a short
short more regretti. Short more D-Wave
short more BTQ.
We're getting still up a lot.
Maybe I'll buy a very very small token
amount of unicure.
What a crazy chart too, right? Unicure's
chart is wacko.
Yeah, I'm worried Kapper is going to
come a little later than expected.
QBT has been pretty good to trade.
cover a little bit. It's worthless, but
I don't mind playing ping pong with that
one. It's a little more of a silly stock
than a real one. So,
buy some Serpa, too.
Oops, wrong one. We go.
Oh, I should cover some
lays as well. This dog [ __ ] L A S.
All right, back to our regularly
scheduled programming. Just made some
small trims and adjustments. Nothing
big.
You always got to stay trimming your
portfolio with a bonsai.
A little little bonsai tree, you know.
Stay trimming.
UNH is very high quality I would say.
Yeah,
large cap, lots of revenue, lots of
earnings. I mean,
I don't really follow UNH that closely.
I did not cover QC.
I covered uh QBT,
but I'm looking to short that again.
Covered some of it.
flying cars.
Uh, I don't know, Nate. That's up to
you. I'm just going to stay long myself.
No need to play play silly games like
that.
Super Q Quantum Computing Inc. The [ __ ]
is that? All these guys are going public
now. There's a lot of supply. Penny Lane
apparently went public. inflection.
I'm going to buy a little buy a little
spruce.
Play more Serupa too.
Even Abbyax is a buy I think.
Okay. All done trimming. Now back to our
regularly scheduled programming. I have
to get this database back up. It's been
a bit of a pain.
Inflection still not public. They got
their merger
for sure.
No, I didn't. Um, NEJM is probably not
going to be something to focus too much
on, but yeah, we'll we'll I only ever
uploaded one into that, so
I don't know. Maybe if you like if you
want it, I mean, I can I can definitely
do it.
Nejm is pretty affordable just on their
website.
But yeah, we sort of becoming a content
aggregator.
Yeah, I'd be careful with uh preipo
biotech. It's not so easy. A lot of
zeros.
It's a treacherous sector just even in
the public markets, let alone
privates.
Yeah, I think that's our job is we
basically just go pay people for content
and
you get it all one place
as an investor and you don't have to pay
for it 85 different places. I think
we're going to do that with a lot of
different people and it's a pretty I
think useful thing especially since you
know you may not use everything if we
pay for some weather special weather
report you probably say oh I don't trade
nat gas what do I care about special
weather forecasts but somebody else
might and then you might read the
biotech thing and the the nat gas person
doesn't read the biotech thing so you
know we can sort of afford to pay pretty
good numbers for
all these users
we have now. But again, it's still
pretty early days for Goodell. You know,
they have to give us a little little bit
of room and time to keep fleshing things
out.
I haven't looked at Mona or IA. I've
been looking mostly large caps.
I have no time between running Goodell
and monitoring the handful of positions
I have.
I thought I would have more time, but
then I had this big database problem, so
had to
fix that up.
Anybody
watch World Series?
Oh, that's funny.
You guys were at the game.
What a wild game.
I I mean, look, you know, in World
Series like that, man, both teams won.
You got to hand it to both teams.
Obviously, only one comes away with the
W, but you can't be anything but proud
of the Blue Jays franchise. I mean, this
was a dog team for a long time.
Dodgers are, you know,
very rich team.
Yeah, I'll try to file the NBA.
I love the NBA. I love basketball. I
just don't have the time given the
amount of things I have to do,
especially now with the new baby. That's
forget it, you know?
But I'll try to catch games here and
there.
You know, my kid's going to be pretty
tall, so we're we're excited. Maybe
he'll play a little ball.
Not really a Nets fan. Not really even a
Knicks fan to be honest. The Knicks
turned most of New York off pretty
hardcore. I was a Knicks fan when I was
a kid, but man, you know, the Knicks are
just
most mismanaged, you know, team in
history.
When was the last time we won a title?
It's been so long.
that uh Bieber that uh Jay's pitcher,
man, he looked so out of pocket up
there. He was like the 10th [ __ ]
reliever
eventually. You know, you put in such a
weak pitcher from such an important
moment.
There's nothing else you could do, I
guess.
That man lost the World Series.
Um, yeah, guy's bald in prison. Um,
nothing too crazy.
Every now and then you'd get a guy who
was decent, but you know, it's a lot of
old guys in prison. It's not really
A lot of Islamic guys. Yeah,
I've always liked PayPal.
Repo is the
definitely people talking about repo
rates and overnight rates stress in the
cash system.
AMD shareholders buying GPUs for OpenAI.
I'm not sure
what that means, but yeah, I see what
you're saying. Okay, so the cash from
AMD going to I'm not really sure. I get
that.
It's going to be good to listen to
Serpa, see how they did.
Obviously, the drug was off the market
for some part of Q3, but it's sort of
back, right?
When was it back? We should look at
that. But either way, the real main
thing is going to be what do they say
about Q4?
If if it sounds like they're
all systems go and people want to use
the drug that the patients,
families, doctors, that's that's the
key.
Give me one second, guys. I'll be right
back.
Uh, I would say go back to
I don't know what Serup is going to do
on the guidance and all that, but I
think they'll talk roughly, you know,
generally about it. I mean,
I don't know if they're going to go
through deep detail, but
okay. So much of this [ __ ] to do. It's
insane.
Okay,
spies are up fractionally. Nvidia's up,
but love to see the quality trade play
out here.
Mom Donnie. Yeah.
Ted Marsh resigning. Chaos at the FDA.
Cure
cure. Small rally there.
Lot going on here.
Yeah, Spruce is a lot of cash now.
Yeah, we're going to listen to uh Saptor
for sure.
I mean, there's not much to capper. I
mean, I've explained it 100 times. It's
just a

I mean, it basically can't work.
Nobody thinks it works.

No, I don't use the levered ETFs. Those
are kind of for suckers.
If you don't know, then you just don't

tell you,

Ed Zitron. Who's Ed Zitron?
Sounds like a nobody to me.
English author.
It's a journalist.
Wrote for Slate. Come on. PR guy. What
does this guy know about companies?
I can't waste my time with people like
that. You saw what happened to Shai
Shia Labuff.
Yeah, long only investors tend to not
get too much respect.
Um,
I think you have to depends on your
results. I guess
it's not like all long short most long
short investors suck. Most long only
investors suck.
So, it's not like you can uh,
you know, investing's hard.

the shy thing is not I think real
that's lawsuit I think it's just some
BS
like you know how one you You probably
guys get like
lots of um DMs about me like like oh um
join my private Discord or some [ __ ]
like that. I think that's what happened
to somebody
and they
they talked to a scammer and they're
blaming the real shy, but the reality is
it was a scammer that
scammed somebody.
Now, why would you want to be in a shy
Discord? I don't know. But
fraud bots, they actually work. And what
was interesting, if you read the
lawsuit, what they did is they're
basically just like go buy call options
in this stock
and then you just split the income. It
says basically it's like 50/50
that you'll actually hit,
which is kind of wild if you think about
it.

Can't help you with that dog.
Got some issues. Stan.
I am 5'9.
Okay, something's winning in my
portfolio here. What's going down
this quantum, I guess.
Yeah, Dwave. There we go. My biggest
short to see that.
Why only 237%.
Well, that was the number when I started
my stream. The number is different now.
Do you want me to update it just for
you?
don't know a lot about Ironwood.
What happened from when? From Friday
from
You got You got to try a complete
sentence here and there because I I
can't read what's in your mind. So when
you say what happened, I I don't really
know what you're talking about.
This is called theory of mind. People
with autism have a hard time with it,
but I can't read your mind.
Yeah, I think Sarah hits 50.
The number does not change during the
day unless I personally change it.
That's why it stays the same even though
it's a very volatile portfolio. Crazy. I
know.
What's HBM? High bandwidth memory. I
like uh I like anything related to HBM.
Yeah.
Well, that sucks for you, Harry.
You shouldn't have done that.
Why? Do you have a gambling problem?
I don't know. Reefs. I don't know.
Yeah, I talk about shores a lot.
Shores is not too useful commercially.
Grovers is kind of a meme.
Grover's I think most people don't
really hold out too much hope for
given it's kind of a hard to implement
algorithm and it's not much of a speed
up either.
So that's just kind of the point there.
I mean, shores is really the only
serious speed up.
It sounds like a gambling problem. A lot
of people in the stock market have a
gambling problem. I would just
I don't know what to say. Try to
try to avoid it.
Hard to make money if you're gambling.
I'm not sure there's a news day today
on D-Wave,
but I hear you.
Every investment or trade is different.
I mean, sometimes I think my short will
work right away. Sometimes they don't.
Can you guys see me? Hear me?
I pretty much spend all my time looking
at quantum. So, yes, I see it.
Of course.
cubit Dwave down nicely here.
Hopefully that continues.
like I said the quality trade is
reversing Oh,
Yeah, Manni is going to
let us fund our port a little more
aggressively.
Put the money in the bag. There's no
more police. Mandani's here.
Police aren't going to help you
now. Put the money in the bag. Got to
make this margin call.
Need a haircut so bad.
pingpong quantum man. I mean, it's
better than it going straight up for

It's really hard to trust that it's
going to continue.

Any other big earnings tonight?
All
right.
Yeah, we're gonna get Whimo New York
Beyond Meat.
I'm not going to stream the earnings,
but we we'll we'll glance at the
earnings. That was a failed attempt at a
meme attempt to make a meme stock.
Sad.
I'd like to look at Dexcom.
best meat stocks. There's actually a
bunch in uh China.
China's got some great pork companies.
Like they're massive.
Uh how do you hedge a short in a binary
event if you don't know the date? Well,
uh, you make a smaller position.
Use cash as your hedge.
Oh, hey, Felix.
I think the last I talked to you, you
were calling me
gay or [ __ ] or something. I forgot
what it was cuz I said baby mom.
Well, reefs is something you're going to
have to get comfortable with. I don't
know how to tell you.
Yeah, I think it was [ __ ] but I
don't remember.
possibly gay as well.
Oh, yeah. I've been recognized a whole
bunch of times. twice in one night
recently. It was uh very flattering.
Everyone's super nice,
especially here in New York.
We don't have an HR department yet, but
I do think we're going to hire our first
HR person pretty soon.
[Music]
He was pretty much related to the baby
mom thing. But anyway,
I
Yeah.
[Music]
[Music]
I need you guys to uh answer these
frequently asked questions.
I only update the
performance as soon as I um start the
stream and it's not it does not update
continuously.
So you just get the instantaneous kind
of return at that time.
I also think did I skip streaming on
Friday?
Kind of feel like I did. Yeah. So I
basically just um market was up a lot
Thursday and Friday for quantum. So, I
just kind of got hammered. But I'm back,
but I'm not going to update the
performance intraday all day. That's
just not
I think too useful.
Uh I think you have to be prepared for
every stock in your portfolio to go to
zero.
Not at the same time, but if there's a
stock in your portfolio would really
really hurt you if it went to zero, you
probably have too much of it.
And that's a U problem.
Yeah, I didn't touch cure. You know, of
course, I wish I bought it for a 50%
gain, but
you know, I made my money on Cure. I
sold it. I'm happy. I wish them luck. I
don't want to gamble.
Quantum's down nicely. I think it's
going to go to zero. What do you mean?
You have to know when to quit. I'm going
to quit when they're at zero or when
they're down a lot. At least I have to
go to zero.
But D-Wave is still one of the most
expensive companies in the world. And
it's a basically a fraudulent company.
So I'm not Why would I stop shorting
that?
Yeah. Be patient. Be patient.
Yeah, I need Dwave back to single
digits.
Dwave, unless Dwave single digits, it's
extremely expensive and even then it's
very sus.
They're all pretty bad. Chan, I I get
this question every day.
Um,
they're all really bad. There's no real
way to say what's the worst quantum.
They all have their really unique
characteristics.
They all could easily be the worst
quantum, which is like very funny.
Yeah, we get D-Wave earnings. When is
INQ? Q is INQ tonight?
We'll do a We'll do a quick sur up to
preview before the close.
Yeah, go for it. I basically went all in
at that price,
which you know, you never want to be all
in, but it was kind of do or die for me.
And
I don't know, Gabriel, if I knew I would
I would be I would have infinite money
if I knew. Okay. Time, stocks, and the
direction. That would be that would be
[ __ ] great. Might have infinite irr.
Go think about it.
Okay, so we get quantum quantum week. So
ion Wednesday, D-Wave Thursday, right?
Exciting.
Sorry, I I have to
restore this database that I broke.
So that's why today's being today's so
boring.
Always try to bring you the greatest in
entertainment.
Exactly. Anthony,
we'll see if Goodell has more revenue
than QBT this quarter.
BTQ below seven. I'd love to see it.
Love to see it.
I don't think you can short spruce, but
I don't know.
Yeah,
I don't think the pipe holders will sell
necessarily.
I know most of the not most, I know a
lot of the pipe holders. I don't see
them selling to be honest.
Yeah, I think you're a little too
confrontational for for people.
But maybe, yeah, I'll uh I don't know
what I'm going to do with the stream,
you know, if I'm going to invest more in
it or
not. I really need the perfect person.
And they kind of need to be
in person on a set, I think, to do it
the best.
I like meta. I am a founder of uh
Goodell.
[Music]
Yeah, there's a good one from uh TBPN
which is more venture focused but very
very good.
I might maybe I should partner with them
or merge with them.
Yeah, I don't have the time.
Uh, I bought some spruce earlier today.
Like I said, you can't overindex to one
stock. I mean, there's so many stocks to
trade.
You know, Spruce is uh very likely to be
a five bagger or more, but it's going to
take time. It's not going to happen
overnight
and there's certainly risk. It's not
risk- free.
There's liquidity as well that are, you
know, obviously the liquidity is a bit
choppy.
So treat it like a venture
like a venture. Uh
looks like a venture investment
that happens to be publicly traded.
I haven't looked at Nova vaccin forever.
Co's over.
Okay, Tony. Who cares?
Let it go. Let it go down.
You can't handle your a stock in your
portfolio going down.
You shouldn't be doing this.
I mean, I I always leave a little room
to buy more, but when I have a position
I'm happy with. Like, let's say my stock
my average on a stock is 150 and I think
it's going to go to 500. Just because it
goes from 150 to 100 doesn't mean I'm
like, "Oh, I got to buy more." Like, you
could just leave it, too. you still
think it's going to go to 500, it's it's
a it's still a good buy. But you don't
have to chase it lower and double,
triple down just because it goes down.
You just wait. You're going to wait
either way. If you're really convinced
it's worth 500, it doesn't make a
difference. If it's 150 or 100 right now
or
only only thing only time it makes a
difference is if it gets close to 500,
then you got to trim it. or if it goes
so low that you really think it's
better. Not that it's a good buy. You
got to think that it's better than your
other
opportunities
that you have in front of you.
I do think it's going to go to 500.
Yeah, maybe more. But it's not happening
tonight.
It's not happening tomorrow most likely.
So, you just got to wait it out. Let's
watch the company progress, you know.
Now, can you double down and buy? You
should do it rarely, and you should only
do it when you know there's a serious
price dislocation. Not if your average
goes from, you know, it your average is
150 and the stock's at 140. You
shouldn't be sitting there saying, "Oh,
I got to double down and lower my
average." You know, that's that's a
loser mentality.
You know, famous most famous saying in
trading is lo loers average losers.
I want to look at the past our online
guys because they didn't the company's
changed a lot with this new drug.
Everything's different now that they
have this new drug.
I gota talk to a colleague real quick. I
don't know about cure. Like I when it
doubled so fast I sold it. Um,
you know,
obviously, you know, they're they're
kind of in dire straits right now, but I
do think the FDA will chickenen out and
give them approval. And in some ways,
this is almost a good thing for them
because now it forces the issue because
the stock was at 60 before and it was
still like 50/50 what the FDA would do.
It was pricing in a 50/50. So, like now
if the FDA changes their mind, we kind
of should be going to 100 plus.
And I think the FDA will change their
mind. So, it's kind of a great long.
Um, I still might buy some up here. It's
up here and down here at the same time.
All right, I got to be right back.
Best book on position sizing is a really
tough one. I mean, you need just
experience, but maybe Arikv's trading to
win would be a good one, but also the um
the Jack Schwagger
Market Wizard series are pretty good.
Okay,

I had such a good time with my son this
weekend.
Although I got to say his crying
sometimes ticked me off.
The good parts were
more than that way. occasional crying.
Maybe I'll get used to it, but it just
kind of gives me a headache.
Yeah, we got SPA on top. We'll
definitely
sales expectations are really low. 336
and 351 for next quarter. I'm guessing
they'll beat that.
I think Palanteer is a little bit more
revenue than Serupa.
Oh, they don't have to beat. I mean, I
think they will.
I don't know.
I think it's just the overall, you know,
anytime you have a business in
transition, I don't think it's about
specific numbers. It's just like overall
like do they feel it's stabilized?
Can they be comfortable with certain
amounts of revenue?
It'll be interesting. Say the least.
New York City, man.
Car alarms. Honks.
construction.
It's enough to make you crazy.
So 336 is the net number. We're going to
have to sort of parse a little bit which
What's coming from? What?
Yeah, the streets really really come
down.
336. That's like too low. It's insanely
low.
Yeah. I don't know how how you can get
that low.
I mean, the company does kind of tell
the street what to do, but maybe
something like this.
The next quarter is 351, which isn't a
whole lot better.
Seems really hard to achieve. Almost
practically impossible.
The kitchen sink is real.
So I think anything above 90
for 11 would be great. Anything above
225 your PMOs would be great. It depends
on how much that collaboration revenue
which is really kind of non-cash revenue
usually what that looks like.
Definitely be interesting.
Keep in mind, last time the company put
it out as an 8K, so get ready. Get ready
for that.
We need even more coffee. I've been
drinking. It's two cups. Now
you're going to have a heart attack. I'm
going to say no. I need to finish the

right, guys. I'm just going to head to

minutes. Don't despair.

It'll be fun to trade that.

Torque got more money than you. Torque's
10 weeks old.
He's 10 years old, man.
It's all right. It's all right. You
know, money is not everything. First of
all,
it's a lot of things, but it's not
everything.
Even my son knows not to go all in like
that,
man. 1% of your portfolio. Try that
first before you try 40%.
1%. How hard is it?
He said, "Nah, I need 40.
I need to go all in." You bought more in
your portfolio than I did. Why? You know
more about it than I do. You heard about
it from me, but you bought more than I
did.
[ __ ] is wrong with you? Then you want to
blame me.
And when you were up, you didn't sell.
I got to hold your hand through the
whole thing,
man. My baby's more independent than
you.
Oh, [ __ ] ass.
Oh, [ __ ] ass ko.
I mean, baby. Are you developmentally
disabled? I mean,
are you are you legally authorized to
make investments?
Do you have an executive or some kind of
trust
acting on your behalf? You might want to
get into conservatorship.
You should not be behind the wheel, but
of any kind of financial transactions.
You clearly cannot be trusted
and make any sober decisions.
Poor guy.
No, for real. I I You know what? you you
should blame me and you should blame
whoever let you invest any amount of
money or open any kind of account cuz
clearly you don't know what the [ __ ]
you're doing
for matter of fact sue E Trade or
whatever cuz they're supposed to whoever
put you gave you that account
interactive whatever you should sue them
you should say you let me invest without
checking if I was disabled or not
and I lost a lot of money I made these
investments. I didn't know what I was
doing. I was just pressing buttons
and I lost a lot of money. You should
have stopped me. Should have gave me a
warning. Something.
Damn.
Yeah. S.
Yeah, you should sue them. Tell them,
tell them the kind of decisions you've
been making. It'll be abundantly clear
that you're not acting in, you know,
your state of mind is a little, you

I mean, is there a loved one that could
also, you know,
explain that you you were not
Man, you're 52 year old years years old.

tougher around here than that.
Your threats mean nothing.
Catch me in the streets. Shut the [ __ ]
up.
Well, you know, the FDA gets to make up
their own mind. I don't I don't run the
FDA, so too bad. I I sold all my [ __ ]

quantum.
Go long, Dwave.
Beattosis.
Oh, you bought the you bought the top of

Bagaholics Anonymous.
I wish I I wish I sold it and shorted to

Suk Madik

involved in Trump crackdown. Sources say
>> suk madik. What do I not show accounts?
Why don't you show accounts? You just

upper right corner. Who does that?
That's what I do. Where's your stream?
Suk my geek.
Sukma.
[Laughter]
All right, enough of this clown.
That was a good entertainment clown.
Thank you for your time.
That was good. I enjoyed that.
But I do have to focus.
That was funny.
I don't know. Everyone's wondering where
Alexander if those the November will hit
or not.
When is the data for Resolute?
Can I even vote as a felon?
Most felons are Democrats, right?
That's why they made it so that maybe we
can vote. I don't know.

QC's coming to the moon.
Let's go. That's bullish news. Why
aren't the stocks up?
I haven't LSS. I'm too scared that there
that today is going to be the last day.
Uh, if I had a levered position, I'd do
that. But
Harry, it's not really your business,
man.
[Music]
[Music]
Not yet. We're trying to get that right
now. Len, our great partners
at S&P Global.
[Music]
I just don't want to snitch on Quantum
to the SEC.
Feels wrong, man.
I ain't trying to snitch
cappers. What' they say? Mid November.
Where the Koreans at?
Yeah, you kind of you also don't need to
get real-time futures if you don't want
one. And then futures prices don't cost
that much relative to
cost of a terminal.
I mean, Bloomberg, you do have to pay
like $4500 a month extra for the data
feeds, but like
that's still only like 20% of the Lost
Money.
[Music]
So what? He's Ugandan. Does that make
sense?
No crypto trades for me lately.
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out if
he's Ugandan and then what is he? What
is his ethnic ethnicity?
Oh, Sukma's here. What's up, Sukma?
Have I seen Saquantum like in person?
Yeah, Lyn, I think the price is going to
be higher than that,
but hopefully it can be a kind of thing
where
Quantum Office tour. No, I didn't listen
to the SLS thing. When are they going to
put out data? Are they ever they ever
putting it out?
Why are they hiding this data, man?
Is Palanteer tonight?
Oh, you didn't tell me Palanteer is
tonight.
Oh [ __ ]
Yeah, I don't think so. Holiday,
something's weird here.
Been high time that they put out this
data.
Yeah, let's look at balance here too.
There's more palenteer
206.
Okay.
Yeah, Palanteer has a bad quarter. It
could affect the whole market. But I
think I mean I don't know what kind of
quarter they'll have honestly. No clue.
Alex. Alec Karp's crazy ass. Alex Karp.
Yeah, man. I hope Koma wins.
All these pretty girls voting for mom
Donnie. What's wrong with them?
[ __ ] is wrong with them?
That's your boy, huh?
You [ __ ] with Mandani, huh?
That's the homie, huh?
Um, I really think mom Donnie is like
actually what we need for this city.
It's like
totally what we're ready for. The
socialism
I'm sick of these far right
MAGA idiots.
Okay. Palanteer
streets at
oh 1.1 billion roughly.
Guidance is roughly around there too.
1180 for the quarter after.
So went up around 100 million.
Okay.
Full year 4140
and full year after that 5630.
Street went up a lot on uh next year.
We're shorting quantum.
We're no longer giving Everybody some
handouts.
Quantum companies have enough.
Baron told me.
Baron told me he's he knows about the
quantum.
Obliterating the metric.
Okay, let's see here.
I forgot carp half black.

[Music]
All right, guys. Just 30 minutes away
here from Palunteer and Surrepta both
reporting
quarterly earnings here in Q3 earning
season.
is him coming out too.
Hims as well.
Uh, I think I think Palanteer will be be
pretty hard here,
but we're just going to have to see.
Valente has a lot of big clients.
I think Sarupa both will go pretty well,
but you know, we you just never know
with earning season. I'm not sitting
there trying to
predict quarters. That's a
somebody else's job.
I think they'll have good numbers. I
don't know what the stock will do.
Let's see if they do 1,200.
I think that would be good enough for
the stock to go up.
They guided to the top end is 1087. If
they can kiss 1,200 or more,
I think the stock can go up. Also
depends on what they guide for next
quarter.
Streets streets at 11 1180. Streets gone
up a lot. So they'd have to guide to
1300 or more there.
And then they would have to boost
guidance obviously for this year to more
than four billion.
But you know, we'll see.
Yeah, the bar is really low for Zarupta,
needless to say.
Yeah, I wouldn't say it burned anyone.
NASDAQ Poppy, when I recommend a stock,
I'm completely free to sell it, do
whatever I want, you know, and the stock
went up like crazy.
I didn't tell you to stay in.
Did I tell you to stay in?
You mad? You baggy?
A poor Pygy.
Little Becky.
Little Baggy need a bottle.
You cry more than my son.
[Music]
[ __ ] It's financial advice. I don't
care. I can give you advice.
I'm not your financial adviser, though.
Well, Quantum's just dropping, you know,
just giving back last week's gains. So,
Oh, he cries all day, little guy.
He stays crying.
That baby likes to cry.
And you know what? Now he's crying when
he doesn't have attention,
which is really annoying. He used to cry
when he was, you know, had discomfort,
which makes a lot more sense.
Now he's just crying just to cry.
Of course, Newegg is short.
[Music]
Greedy bag holders.
Don't hold the B. Don't hold the bag too
long. You might start crying, too.
I I had so much money. What happened?
The stock went down. Oh, no.
I thought you knew it was going to
happen every tick of the way.
Thanks, Sarbs.
That's nice of you for even looking it
up.
Oh boy. Dusty.

They lost it all on Beyond and Open.
They can't gamble anymore.

No, I didn't listen to Rogan. I don't
really listen to Rogan.
It's not my
not my jam.
[Music]
Oh,

Didn't even mention quantum once. I
don't even know what it is.
Quantum on Mars.
Yeah, I need that pardon, Bruce. Come
on, Bruce.
Give me the pardon.
I know you're I know you're listening
out there. Make that call.
Warren Buffet.
Warren Buffet and Rogan would be kind of
goated.
He's a swindler.
What he swindle?
Oh, I vote.
I'm allowed to vote.
I'm glad reached out.
Oh [ __ ] I got to get ready for
earnings.
It's coming right now.
Okay. Hims Palanteer and
Serupa.
Let me open up my HIMS model.
This will be interesting.
They give guidance.
He's tremendous.
They're all tremendous.
Good.
Garp tells it like it is. Make sure you
try godell god terminal.com.
Try that today.
I don't know. Go for it. If I knew I
would let you know, but I don't know.
It's a good question.
570 to 590 guidance.
580 and 632.
10 minutes.
How does this appear before? So weird.
Okay.
Is Vertex tonight too?
What? You think I made those up?
You got the AL car poster on the wall.
I don't understand what folders to the
tabs means. You have to explain what
that is.
Little more detail. What's a folder to
the tab like?
Yeah, I still don't get it.
Sorry, I might be a little dull here.
I'm not a palunteer investor. I do trade
it a lot, usually to the long side.
Yeah. I'm not sure what the guy's trying
to say.
Emacs
them
folders to the tabs. I still don't know
what that means.
Play it off. What does that mean?
So, I don't know what that means.
Collapse components. You want to be able
to collapse components.
Group tabs.
Why would you group tabs? Oh, like
Chrome.
Still not 100% clear.
Oh, you want a menu? Is that what you're
saying? A menu?
Why would you group the tabs into
folders?
Oh, you want different Oh, I think I get
this.
How many tabs did you make?
That's an interesting way of using the
app, I guess.
Well, you can make as many tabs as you
want.
How many tabs do you do you
nested tabs? Why?
I mean, well, I'll do it. I just want to
understand why you need that.
How many how many total tabs are you
working with that you need to nest them?
I think most people don't even have more
than one tab.
We can do it. I just
Well, I mean, yeah, you can. I have four
down here. I only use one.
Okay, here we go.
Get ready.
[ __ ] thing.
[ __ ] thing sucks.
Who will be first?
Sera came out with a 8K last time. So, I
want to see if
maybe that comes first.
Who's ready?
Is your body ready?
All quiet on the western front.
Shit's about to go crazy.
Rashad, what is you? What do you know,
Rashad?
Quickest gun in the west.
Bow down.
Come on.
Guys are distracting me.
Said for Getty closes a thing of beauty.
What do you mean? Oh, I see it. Okay.
All quantum closes. We're good.
Thinking 405.
Yeah, that P&L came
came right back. Love it.
Vertex beat.
Okay, here we go.
Come on.
Ready.
Three,
two,
one. It's out. Surrept is out.
399 beats significantly. Surrept is
going to be up a bunch here. See if I
can sweep some.
[ __ ]
Hims is out. Palunteer is out.
Palunteer
thinks are all coming out at once.
one point almost almost 1.2. That's
pretty good. I would not chase Palanteer
up here though. That's not that good.
I think that's that's around what you
would expect. Let's see what the uh
guidance looks like.
One three. Wow. Monster guidance. What
the [ __ ]
Oh man. Sick guidance. That's uh Yeah,
that's something. So, you get 700 24.
Wow.
Yeah, I think I think I think Palanteer
is going to go up. Soft is good. Hims
haven't seen it yet.
M 600
guidance 605 to 625 guidance.
That's really bad. Damn's going to be
down a lot. I think
obviously
that Q4 guidance is really disgusting.
All right, Leus.
What are they saying? Oh, Essence did
not
Essence
didn't meet primary.
Okay. Affected by the COVID pandemic.
370. Levitus was 1315. That's really
good.
Got a V-shaped recovery for Levitus.
Then 2385 for PMO which was also good.
Essence was 309.
That's a
continued kind of BS for
from Supta.
They're protesting quite a bit about
the essence trial.
positive cash flow in the quarter.
Yeah. The question is will will they
pull the PMOs for that?
>> I don't think so.
I don't know. I'd buy. Let me think
here.
Yeah, maybe I'll buy some.
Thought these [ __ ] PMOs.
I don't know why hims is moving in the
right direction.
Wow. Ser is getting shellacked.
I don't think they're going to take take
the PMOs away.
But here, let me buy some
extended hours.
This is kind of a known binary risk for
Serupta, but
I don't think there was a conditional.
There's accelerated approval. Is that
the same as conditional? I think it is.
Right.
Okay. Bought some here.
1944.
It's not It's also not for the other
PMO, right?
They want to get accelerated approval.
That's a bit of a bluff. They want full
approval, which is, you know, a bit of a
bluff there. I don't know why they would
put that there. They're obviously not
going to get full approval.
All right, let me see if I could buy
some more.
Okay, bought some more at 1844.
Wow.
Jesus Christ.
Good old Serupa.
1779.
Let's keep going.
Raise the bid to 18.
Missed it.
Try 18 and a half.
Uh 1835.
Damn it. Missing it.
I'm surprised him up.
Kim's guidance was bad. I don't I don't
see
him is literally below consensus, right?
Consensus 632. Him's coming in at 605 to
625.
Maybe the expectations were for worse.
Oh, active discussions with Novo. That
must be it.
Okay, that must be it because the
numbers weren't good, but the active
discussions with Novo is pretty
pretty good.
That's bullish.
Better than Novo suing the [ __ ] out of
them, right?
Yeah, I don't think they're going to
remove the PMOs from the market. So,
never know with this FDA. They're
Venet is not the biggest fan.
[ __ ] disruptor.
I think I got filled.
Oh, yeah. I got filled.
Let's see here. Got filled at 19 for
another lot.
All right.
I'm a baggie. Yes, I am.
Okay. How much did I buy?
I got a decent amount now.
P value.3. Come on.
Did anyone expect the PMO to work?
And the whole point that we know it
doesn't work.
We've known this drug doesn't work for
years.
None of these drugs work.
They talk about Levitus.
It's still really cheap.
I mean, if they did a bigger study, they
probably would have met.
Yeah, I don't think they're saying I
don't think they're yanking it. Should
recover.
Pain in the ass.
Call in 10 minutes.
Please cost of goods. Jesus.
Why are the cost of goods up so much?
Must be some weird
They've been able to grow net cash
despite this sort of crisis. That's
pretty good.
No casual statement here.
All right. Well,
Guess
I'm a baggie.
Where's Ian?
Oh, I didn't have too much Sarupa.
I still like it.
I'm mostly just short quantum.
Should I cover regetti or something and
buy some Chapter
I'll show some solid show some
solidarity with Few baggies.
Oh [ __ ] just missed it.
There we go.
Yeah, I don't know. I feel like maybe
it'll come back because there just
wasn't a lot of high expectations that
the PMOs worked in the first place
and companies
kind of BSing I guess. But it like is
the company,
you know, basically can the company
[ __ ] the FDA one more time?
They still have other they have they
have three PMOs.
Two of them have had uh confirmatory.
What about the other one? Is Exonus ex
at a person ever going to have one?
Oh yeah, I'm definitely not selling. I
bought some.
It's way too cheap. Just just on Levitus
alone, you you can justify the market
cap.
Good afternoon and welcome to
today's program being recorded at this
time of Tam Thornton, director of
investor relations. Please go ahead.
>> Thank you and thank you all for joining
today's call. Earlier this afternoon, we
released our financial results for the
third quarter of 2025. The press release
and slides are available on the investor
section of our website at surupa.com and
our 10Q will be filed with the
securities and exchange commission on
Thursday aftermarket. Joining us on the
call today are Doug Ingram, Dr. Louise
Rodino Clayac, Patrick Moss, Anntop, and
Ryan Wong. After our formal remarks,
we'll open the call for Q&A. I'd like to
note that during this call, we will be
making a number of forward-looking
statements. Please refer to slide two on
the webcast which contains our
forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements involve risks
and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond structured control. Actual
results can materially differ from these
forward-looking statements, and any such
risks can materially and adversely
affect the business, the results of
operations and trading prices for
surface common stock. for a detailed
description of applicable risks and
uncertainties. We encourage you to
review the company's most recent SEC
filings. The company does not undertake
any obligations to publicly update its
forward-looking statements, including
any financial projections provided today
based on subsequent events or

we will discuss non-GAAP financial
measures on this webcast. Descriptions
of these non-GAAP financial measures and
reconciliations of gap to non-GAAP
financial measures are included in
today's press release and the slide
presentation available on the investor
section of our website. And now I'll
turn the call over to our CEO, Doug
Ingram, who will provide an overview of
our recent progress. Doug,
>> thank you, Cam. Good afternoon,
everyone. Thank you for joining us for
our third quarter 2025 financial results
conference call. Next slide, please.
We have much to discuss this evening,
but let's begin by reviewing the
completion of our confirmatory study for
our two ultra rare disease TMOs, Leandis
and Amandis, before coming back to our
quarterly update. Next slide.
I'm going to turn the call over to Dr.
Reno Clayac very shortly, but let me
first give some broad conclusions.
First, we are very proud to have
completed our primary confirmatory
obligations. Both Amandis and Byondis
serve ultra rare populations with total
prevalence
numbering for each no more than about
500 to 800 patients in the United States
and an incident rate per year of maybe a
few dozen patients. This disease is also
heterogeneous and degenerates not over
months or years but literally over
decades. These together make the
powering and conduct of a placeboc
control trial particularly challenging.
I want to give a huge thanks to our
investigators and then very importantly
to the brave families who have had the
courage to enroll and risk a placebo arm
for 22 months. Without this special
community that we serve, we would not
have completed this unusually ownorous
study. Second, when reviewing the
evidence to support transition from
accelerated to traditional approval of a
therapy, one of course looks to the
totality of the evidence. Here, the
division recognized the challenges
associated with this ultra rare disease
trial and set out a very specific
standard for continuing marketing
authorizations.
As referenced in our viandis approval
material, the FDA gave us a very
specific written language about
voluntarily withdrawing marketing
authorization which would only occur if
quote no relevant analyses find
sufficient evidence of a clinical
benefit. As you will hear from Dr. Reino
clayac. We believe that we have met that
standard and that we have sufficient
evidence to discuss with the agency
transitioning
from accelerated to traditional
approval. Consider as you will have seen
in our press release, the study missed
its statistical significance. However,
the data demonstrated a consistent and
clinically favorable trend across the
trial population. Importantly, a portion
of this study was conducted over the
COVID pandemic period. And as with many
studies over that period, the study
results were impacted for a variety of
reasons. During the pandemic, the rate
of missed doses was unusually high with
nearly all patients missing doses and
approaching half of whom missed
substantial consecutive doses.
Participants in the study were also
largely shut in and suffered deep
conditioning and loss of mobility. All
of this appears to have confounded the
results. When one excludes the COVID
participants, we see a meaningful
treatment benefit slowing disease
progression by about 30% which Dr.
Redino Clayfact will further explain.
Likewise, to enroll this study, we were
required to admit a broad population
from as young as six years old to as old
as 13 years old, including those who
would clearly have confounding ceiling
and floor effects. In a subgroup
analysis of those likely to progress,
there was a strong statistically
significant benefit and this was across
not only the primary but the other end
points as well. There's also a wealth of
published realworld evidence for the
PMOs. As just a few examples of the
multiple realworld studies across our
DMOS, we see that when tracking viis
over six years, there is an 88%
reduction in risk of loss of ambulation
with a Kaplan Meyer analysis of delay of
about three years. Likewise with both
Bandis and Amandis, we see over time a
significant attenuation in pulmonary
decline and a significant delay in time
to coughyst and ventilation. We see the
same trend in our own study essence as
part of the benefits they are seeing
patients are required to be infused
weekly a fairly ownorous protocol and
yet their compliance rate has been well
over 90% commercially year over year
over year when one considers all of the
evidence for benefit and then weighs a
favorable sta stable safety profile is
tracked over many years we believe the
risk benefit remains positive. We not
only anticipate continuing marketing
authorization, but we believe we have a
good argument for traditional approval.
Our plan is to schedule a meeting with
the division to review the totality of
the evidence. Dr. Reachback will now
discuss those results in more detail.
Luis,
>> thank you Doug. Can I have the next
slide?
Today we announced the topline results
from our essence trial. The first
placeboc controlled phase three study of
exxon skipping therapies 53 or gold and
amandis 45 of crazation to treat
patients with duchen musculardrophe
amenable to exxon 53 or 45 skipping
respectively.
To remind you bionis and amandis are
designed to address the underlying cause
of duchen by restoring the messenger RNA
or mrna reading frame. The therapies use
SUpt's proprietary PMO chemistry and
exxon skipping technology to skip exxons
53 and 45 of the distrophin gene.
Promoting the synthesis of a shortened
functional distrophin protein is
intended to slow decline in duchen
patients. Bionis and amandis were
approved by FDA via the accelerated
approval pathway in 2019 and 2021
respectively.
Next slide please.
As shown on this slide, initiated in
September 2016, the 225 person essence
study was designed as a double blind
placeboc control trial spanning 96 weeks
followed by a 48-week openlel extension
reflecting the scale, rigor, and
long-term commitment required to
validate targeted treatments and select
rare disease populations such as duchen.
The trial was conducted across 75
centers in 24 countries. Next slide,
please.
In terms of baseline demographics,
patients were well matched with 2 to1
treated versus placebo with numbers of
exxon 45 and exxon 53 amenable patients
consistent with the prevalent duchen
population.
Functional baseline characteristics were
also well matched. Now turning to the
topline results on the next slide.
Essence demonstrated numerical
superiority across the primary and most
secondary endpoint. However, the study
did not reach statistical significance
on the primary endpoint, the four-step
ascend at 96 weeks. Let me first
highlight the key results and then I'll
provide more detail on each first. And
as mentioned, we believe COVID impacted
study results. A post hoc analysis of
participants not impacted by COVID
improves study results on the four-step
ascend with a leaf squares mean
difference of 0.11 steps per second and
a p value of 0.09.
Second, when a prognostic score is
applied to identify the sub population
at risk for decline on four step ascend,
a meaningful and significant treatment
response is evident with a le square
mean difference of 0.186 steps per
second and a p value of 0.01.
And importantly, there were no new
safety signals with comparable AE rates
between treated and placebo.
AES were largely mild or moderate.
Next slide please.
As you will see on this slide and as I
mentioned previously, although the data
showed numerical superiority, the
primary endpoint of the study was not
met.
Next slide, please.
As Doug mentioned, CO appears to have an
impact on study results. The study
itself was challenged operationally
during the COVID period with twice as
many consecutively missed doses during
COVID versus COVID-free patients and
compressed clinical evaluation
schedules. 43% of COVID impacted
patients had consecutively missed doses
with an average of eight missed doses.
In addition, published studies
specifically on the impact of the COVID
pandemic in duchen have demonstrated a
negative impact on function due to
immobility, contraurs, and increased
weight gain.
On this slide, I've highlighted the
COVID period that falls in the middle of
the Essence study, which began in late
2016 and completed in 2025.
We define patients that began and
completed their 96 weeks outside of this
window as COVID-F free. Next slide
please.
Notably, a post talk analysis of the
COVID-free participants improved study
results on the fourstep ascend primary
endpoint as shown on the left with a le
square meaner of 0.11 steps per second
and a p value of 0.09.
This equates to an approximately 30%
reduction in disease progression over
two years on the four-step ascent. This
is in stark contrast to those
individuals impacted by CO on the right.
Had we seen this effect size in a sample
size similar for the whole trial
population, we would expect it would
have reached statistical significance.
Secondary endpoints also demonstrated
improved study results in COVID-free
participants.
Next slide, please.
>> The line was better. We also performed
an analysis using a prognostic scoring
method published by the purple line is
better
>> a collaborative trajectory analysis
project group which is focused on
duchen.
>> This method published after we commenced
essence is used to identify the
population most at risk for decline and
consequently where maximum treatment
benefit can be identified by avoiding
floor and ceiling effects. The method
includes baseline age, fourstep ascend
velocity, rise from floor velocity, 10
meter walk run velocity, and
corticosteroid duration and type. The
fourstep ascent was the most sensitive
endpoint and reached statistical
significance with this prognostic score
applied.
But the clinically meaningful le square
mean difference of 0.186 steps per
second and a p value of 0.01.
This equates to a 35% reduction in
disease progression over two years on
the four-step event.
Next slide, please.
There were no new safety signals with
comparable adverse event rates between
treated and placebo, reinforcing the
favorable and manageable safety profile
observed with our Exxon skipping
therapies. Adverse events were largely
mild or moderate.
We believe the totality of these data
along with the real world evidence are
compelling for Amandis and Bandis and
we'll be sharing these data with FDA to
support FND filings.
>> Next slide please.
Of note, as you will see here, a number
of factors generated from the real world
evidence supports Kasmmer, including a
mean age of 15 years for Kasmmer treated
patients to need a wheelchair versus 9.5
to 12.3 years in the literature for
standard of care. It also shows a 2.6
six-year delay in time to reach FBC
predicted a less of less than 60% for
patients 10 to 18 years old versus match
controls and a 70% reduction in
mortality rate for our PMOs. Next slide,
please.
On this slide, you will see how the real
world evidence supports goladers,
including a three-year delay in loss of
ambulation versus external control, a
7.5-year delay in the need for nighttime
ventilation, and a 70% reduction in
mortality. Next slide, please.
As you can appreciate on this slide, the
real world body of evidence supports the
effect of our PMOs on the trajectory of
Gent, including an impressive 5.4 4 year
increase in survival, a 3 to fouryear
delay in loss of ambulation, and
significantly slower rates of pulmonary
and cardiac decline. Next slide.
Further, it's important to note that our
exxon skipping therapies have treated
over 1,800 patients worldwide.
>> Infants to adults in their 30s,
providing a robust foundation of
clinical experience and real world
evidence showing PMOs have been nothing.
I don't think anything disease
progression. including delayed loss of
ventilation, preserved pulmonary and
cardiac function and extending survival.
With a patient adherence rate of more
than 90%, the sustained use reflects the
clinical value of our Exxon skippers.
And we were also pleased to announce at
this year's World Muscle Society meeting
that a clinically meaningful attenuation
of pulmonary decline was demonstrated in
patients with advanced duchen treated
with kasm compared to matched external
controls.
And it's also important to note that
most of our postmarketing requirements
or PMRs have been completed.
Next slide, please.
In terms of next steps, with the
completion of Essence, we've submitted
the topline results to the agency. We
plan to submit a request to schedule a
meeting with the division by the end of
the year to review the totality of
evidence and discuss the path to a
traditional approval. Our findings will
also be shared at future scientific
forums with plans for publication in a
peer-reviewed journal.
I'd like to take this moment to thank
the Duchen community, clinical trial
investigators, and Koss for their
unwavering support these past years.
Drug development often poses what can
seem like unmovable obstacles. In the
face of those obstacles, particularly in
rare and ultra rare disease, we remain
steadfast in the science and focused on
taking the best, albeit at times the
more challenging path forward for the
benefit of patients. We remain committed
to our exxon skipping therapies and to
the benefit they have provided and
continue to provide to those living with
duchen. I'll now turn the call back to
Doug.
>> Thank you, Louise. All right, next next
slide, please. Let's move now to
performance. Notwithstanding
unprecedented disruptions in the
quarter, Levitus and the PMOs together
posted solid net product revenue of $370
million for the quarter. Our chief
commercial officer Patrick Moss will
provide more color on that in a moment.
As to the Levitus label, we have had
very productive dialogue with OTP and we
expect the label change process with FDA
to be concluded very soon. Dr. Regina
Quayak will discuss our expectations for
the label very shortly along with our
planned trial for the prophylactic
treatment of cerolamus. As relates to
our portfolio, we are very enthusiastic
about our sir platform as the rest of
biotech appears also to be enthused with
the increasingly big risk potential of
sir. Luis will discuss our progress on
that in a bit. Finally, I would note
that in the quarter, we took several
important actions to strengthen our
financial performance and align our
resources with our strategic focus on
supporting our current therapies while
we advance our largely sir based
pipeline. Our CFO Ryan Wert divided Fed
policy makers stake up positions ahead
of December meeting.
>> I will turn the call back over to Luis
again to make some remarks on Levitus
and on our pipeline.
Please.
>> Thank you, Doug. I have the next slide,
please. Moving now to our Levitus and
pipeline updates. Next slide.
To update you on the safety label
process for Levitus. As previously
discussed, we've agreed to a blackbox
warning for ALI and ALF. Also consistent
with the action we've already taken to
pause shipments to non-ambulatory
patients, we've agreed with the FDA that
non-ambulatory will be removed from the
indication and usage section of the
prescribing information.
Once we have an understanding of the
risk benefit analysis for seramus, we
will discuss with FDA if data are
sufficient to resume dosing
non-ambulatory patients. Next slide,
please.
As you're aware, we convened an expert
committee to discuss ALF and the
potential of adding additional
immunosuppression regimen for the
non-ambulent population.
Earlier this month, the committee which
consisted of numerous globally
recognized, highly experienced medical
specialists, including neuromuscular
physicians with a levitous treatment
experience, hepatologists and specialist
experience in imunosuppressive therapies
shared their findings at W in which they
analyzed and reviewed ALF safety data to
identify early indicators of ALI and to
find populations at elevated risk for
ALF. They evaluated and recommended
strategies to prevent and mitigate ALI
and ALS emphasizing early risk
recognition and patient stratification.
A focus on interventions, clinical
pathways and riskbased management.
Optimize clinical management approaches
for ALI and ALF including prophylactic
imunosuppression and monitoring
parameters.
Based on these discussions and analyses,
the committee endorsed modifying hpatic
biomarker thresholds in ALI to
facilitate timely intervention. They
also recommended enhanced liver
characterization at baseline to better
understand risk factors of developing
ALI.
In terms of ALI prevention, they
recommended adding prophylactic seroma
as a second agent to the current
cortical steroid regimen versus
increasing cortical steroid doses. And
this is one to two weeks prior to
infusing levus. In terms of ALI
management, the committee recommended
prompt initiation of IV cortical
steroids if patients do not respond to
oral cortical steroids.
Lastly, they emphasize the need to
generate real world and clinical data.
For that end, and as we've communicated
previously, cohort 8 of our endeavor
study is designed to demonstrate the
effectiveness of additional prophylactic
imunosuppression in non-ambulatory
patients receiving a lotus. We are in
discussions with FDA about the design of
this study and hope to be able to
commence it soon. Next slide, please.
Also of note at this year's WMS meeting
were the results of an independent study
led by Dr. Jonathan Sauso from the
department of pediatrics at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. The study
included 20 duchen patients who received
a levitus. The first 14 patients
received a levitus with a standard
protocol including corticosteroids but
no additional imunosuppression.
The six subsequent patients underwent a
modified iminous suppression protocol
with seramus. The objective was to show
that initial safety, tolerability and
efficacy of seroma prophylaxis.
What the results demonstrated was that a
low dose of cerolamus prophylaxis
appeared to be safe and well tolerated
in the duchen patients receiving a
levitus and there were no observed
increases in liver enzymes in the six
patients treating this derolment.
Next slide please.
Moving now to our pipeline updates.
Next slide. And beginning with our LGMD
type 2E program
regarding SRP 9003 for LGMD2 type 2E. We
recently presented positive phase 3
emerging data at the WMS meeting. The
study met its primary endpoint
demonstrating a significant increase in
betaoglycen expression. In addition,
restoration of other cycly complex
proteins in both ambulatory and
non-ambulatory patients was
demonstrated.
Further, our safety and tolerability
results were consistent with previous
results. We are encouraged by these data
to support SRP 9003's clinical benefits
in patients living with LGMD type 2E. To
determine the path forward, we have
scheduled a meeting with the FDA this
quarter. Following this regulatory
dialogue, we will assess the
requirements and determine the
appropriate next steps for the program.
Lastly, we turn to our promising sir
pipeline. The recent activity in this
space underscores the significant
opportunity for this modality and we're
excited by our potential best-in-class
approaches. Our DM1 and FSHD programs
continue to advance rapidly. Enrollment
is progressing well in both trials. For
DM1, enrollment in the SAD studies
complete and cohort 4 of the MAD study
at six per kig is currently enrolling.
For FSHD, enrollment of the SAD study is
complete and cohort six of the MAD study
or 12 mix perig will begin enrolling
this month. While we previously expected
to release single dose of sending data
by the end of the year, our team is
currently prioritizing the transfer and
validation of assays necessary to
provide highquality PD data. As a
result, we now anticipate sharing these
initial results in the first quarter of
2026.
We also plan to initiate our trial for
Huntington's disease by the urant. This
program utilizes a subcutaneous route of
administration allowing for deep drain
regions like the striarium particularly
affected by Huntington. In addition to
the second generation DM1 candidate
selected at the close which has the
ability to cross the bloodb brain
barrier and address the cognitive
aspects of DM1. We have also selected
three of our research targets which we
plan to discuss at a later date. We
continue to be excited by our
differentiated approaches with sa and
look forward to updating you in 2026.
I'll turn the call over to Patrick Moss
for an update on our commercial
performance. Next slide. Patrick.
>> Thank you Louise and good afternoon
everyone. My comments today will focus
on three areas. A review of our Q3
performance. My thoughts on the essence
results and our expectations for the
trajectory of Levitus. Next slide
please.
Total product revenue for the quarter
was 370 million including
million in 11 net product revenue and
239 million in PMO net product revenue.
The pause in shipments to the
amulatoratory population which resumed
following the FDA's recommendation
created meaningful disruptions to
patient access. Some infusion dates were
cancelled, requiring some families to
rein initiate the logistical process.
Antibbody testing, rescheduling
appointments, and reconfirming insurance
authorization.
New patient says label update expected
to have limited effect
>> requiring clarification on the reasons
for the voluntary pause. Despite these
challenges, our teams responded swiftly
and decisively, working closely with
sites and families to ensure continuity
of care. Importantly, demand for Levitus
proved resilient amongst those patients
that had scheduled infusions with some
infusions resuming within a week of
lifting the pause on ambulatory
shipments.
We also continued to engage our key
stakeholders including payers. We've had
a productive discussions with payers
since the pause and have not seen
unfavorable shifts in coverage for
Levitus. In the amulatoratory
population, approximately 220 million
lives have a path to coverage. We
continue to fight for our patients and
to date we're not aware of a single
permanent denial for coverage.
Our PMO franchise delivered strong
demand based on performance this
quarter. Performance also benefited from
additional shipping days in the Q3
calendar compared to the upcoming fourth
quarter. Now turning to the Essence
study, we look forward to connecting
with physicians, patients, and payers to
share the data at upcoming congresses
and through additional compliant
channels. We believe the totality of the
evidence demonstrating the value of our
PMOs will be viewed by HCPs and families
as proof of an innovative treatment
option that can have an impact on the
trajectory of the disease. Our PMOs have
generated a significant amount of real
world evidence supporting the efficacy
of these products. The real world
evidence coupled with the data set from
Essence only solidifies our view about
the importance of these treatment
options for patients living with duchen.
As evidenced by our Q3 performance, we
have successfully restarted shipping for
ambulatory patients and we've have begun
to see new Levitus enrollment forms
submitted. However, the disruptions in
the market this year combined with the
typical seasonal dynamics in Q4 will
temporarily impact demand generation and
the influx of new enrollment forms. Due
to the resulting delays, we expect the
Q4 infusion volumes to be flat to
slightly down from Q3.
Despite these near-term dynamics, we
remain confident in the long-term
opportunity for Levitus and are
comfortable reiterating our guidance
that the ambulant population alone
represents an annual revenue opportunity
with a 500 million floor. Our conviction
is based on the wealth of data
demonstrating the benefits of Levitus.
Further, based on our ongoing dialogue
with providers, we do not anticipate the
inclusion of the box warning in the
final labeled have a significant impact
on prescribing behaviors and our field
teams are fully equipped to support
inform conversations with all
stakeholders.
The data continues to reinforce this
long-term view. We are energized by the
reception to our data presentations at
this year's World Muscle Society. In
particular, the three-year functional
outcomes data for Levitus has resonated
strongly with healthcare providers,
reinforcing the durability of benefit
and the therapy's potential to slow
disease progression.
Now to remind everyone we have now
treated greater than,00 patients with
Levitus in both the clinical and
commercial setting providing patients
with an effective therapy that is
designed to impact the trajectory of
their disease. Taken together, these
results underscore the strength of our
portfolio and the resilience of our
commercial execution. This team has led
an incredible launch through undoubtedly
turbulent times and I have the
conviction that this team will continue
to deliver results. We remain deeply
committed to supporting patients and
families and we are confident in our
ability to navigate the near-term
dynamics while advancing our mission to
transform the lives of those living with
this devastating disease. As I continue
to meet with HCPs and hear family
stories, I am moved by how our therapies
are having a positive impact on the
lives of patients living with Duchen.
I'll now turn the call over to Ryan Wong
to discuss financial results. Ryan,
>> thank you Patrick and good afternoon
everyone. This afternoon's press release
provided details for the third quarter
of 2025 on a GAP basis as well as a
non-GAAP basis. Please refer to the
press release available on SRP's website
for a full reconciliation of GAP to
non-GAAP financial results. Next slide,
please.
I'd like to start my remarks today by
thanking the STRA team for their
commitment and diligence as we executed
well against revised strategy and
refocused pipeline that we announced in
July. Importantly, we took proactive
steps in the third quarter to enhance
our near-term liquidity and to improve
our balance sheet and debt profile. We
monetized strategic investments,
completed a debt exchange which reduced
maturities due in 2027 from 1.15 billion
to 450 million and significantly reduced
our go forward cost structure. In Q3, we
were cash flow positive. Cash and
investments increased from 850 million
to 865 million. And from the
strengthened financial foundation, we
will continue to advance our pipeline
and strategy.
I will now touch on the key highlights
from our third quarter financial
results. Next slide, please.
Total revenues were 399 million in the
quarter, which consisted of 370 million
in net product revenues and 29 million
of collaboration and other revenues,
which relates to contract manufacturing
and royalty income from our partnership
with Roch. Q3 cost of sales totaled 151
million, up from 92 million in the same
quarter prior year. The increase
reflects higher levitous cost of goods
due to depletion of previously expensed
inventory and increased failed cash
batch costs. Additionally, we recorded
22 million in charges for write-offs of
deposits tied to certain 11us
manufacturing suites and take or pay
shortfall payments.
Following the pause in shipping to the
non-inventory population, we acted
quickly with our strategic manufacturing
partner to align production with
near-term demand. As a result, we have
deferred manufacturing commitments and
payments from the first half of 2026 to
2027 while maintaining what we expect to
be sufficient inventory to meet global
demand.
Moving on to expenses, let me start with
the restructuring charge reported in Q3.
Following our July business and strategy
update, which included a reduction in
force and rep prioritization of our
pipeline, we encouraged 41 million in
restructuring costs, of which 35 million
related to severance and other onetime
termination benefits and the remainder
related to the accelerated depreciation
of certain impacted assets. Moving next
to R&D.
In the third quarter, GAP R&D expenses
were 219 million and non-GAAP R&D
expenses were 27 million, both
essentially flat to prior year. Nearly
half of our reported R&D expense relates
to the $100 million milestone paid to
arrowhead for meeting certain enrollment
and safety thresholds in our SRP10003
DM1 program.
Turning to SGNA, we reported 92 million
and 77 million on a gap and non-GAAP
basis, respectively, representing a
year-over-year decrease of 28% and 23%
respectively. These decreases were
driven by lower compensation expenses as
well as lower commercial spend following
our cost restructuring effort.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the
year, we expect combined non-GAAP R&D
and SG expenses of approximately 420 to
430 million in the fourth quarter. This
includes 200 million payload arrowhead
for the second DM1 milestone, which we
anticipate recording in Q4 with payment
due in the first quarter of 2026.
For the full year, our guidance for
combined non-GAAP R&D and SJ expenses is
approximately 1.86 86 billion. Excluding
the arrowhead transaction costs and GM1
milestones together totaling 884
million, our underlying expense guidance
is roughly 976 million. Recall our 2025
guidance prior to our July business and
strategy update was between 1.2 and 1.3
billion, which means we have reduced
plan expenses by nearly 300 million from
the midpoint. This reflects our
commitment to discipline capital
allocation and we remain on track to
meet our restructuring targets into next
year. Lastly, in Q3, we reported an
operating loss of 103 million and 36
million on a gap and a non-GAAP basis,
respectively. Adjusting for the 41
million restructuring charge and the 100
million DM1 milestone, our underlying
business would have reported a gap and
non-GAAP operating profit of 37 million
and 54 million respectively.
Additionally, adjusting for the 584
million arrowhead upfront transaction
cost, our underlying business has
delivered a robust year-to- date GAP and
non-GAAP operating profit of 436 million
and 561 million, respectively. In
closing, with our financial performance
and the actions we took in the quarter
to strengthen our financial foundation,
we believe we are well positioned to
execute our strategy and meet our
financial obligations even under revenue
stress test scenarios. Looking ahead,
our capital allocation priorities remain
focused on investment that drive demand
for our onmarket therapies and advance
our SNIA platform for his potential
near-term value inflection points. And
now I'll turn the call back to Doug for
closing remarks. Doug,
>> thank you Ryan. Let's um let's open the
call for um questions and then I'll make
some closing remarks.
>> Thank you. We will now begin the
question and answer session. If you have
dialed in and would like to ask a
question, please press star one on your
telephone keypad to raise your hand and
join the queue. If you would like to
withdraw your question, simply press
star one. Again, we ask that you please
limit yourselves to one question to
allow everyone an opportunity to ask a
question.
We'll go first to Anna Pamama at GP
Morgan.
>> Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the
question. Um I had a just quick question
on uh essence. You guys talked a lot
about some of the additional analyses
and the COVID impact here. Um what other
end points should we be looking for in a
publication and or medical conference
presentation, you know, FDA package that
you think that would be supportive of
some of the data that you presented here
today? Thanks so much.
>> Yeah, thank you for that question. I'll
turn this to Luis.
>> Yeah, thanks for the question. So first
we'll be looking at the totality of
evidence. So essence will be one part of
that but as we mentioned the real world
evidence data uh is significant over
many many years and showing a benefit in
terms of essence. This is the the top
line. We have other secondary endpoints
that include um functional endpoints and
also biological endpoints like
expression uh which are not complete
yet. So all of that will be in the final
CSR will be uh presented to the agency
and then that will be presented in a
medical meeting. Um but as I mentioned
in my remarks the primary and
secondaries um favored um uh the PMOs
and uh in terms of COVID we saw the
similar result that we saw with the
primary and in in which case you saw
improvement with those end points uh
when you looked at the co co-free
population.
>> We'll go next G Wang at Barclays.
Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe
I'll just follow up regarding the
COVID-free population. When we look at
the P value, it is still relatively
high. It's a 0.09.
So like how do you think the FD will
look at, you know, the data sets here?
And what could be the potential outcome
with the FDA decision? You know, one
could be for approval. Should we also be
worried about the drug could be pulled
off the market as potential worst case
scenario?
Yeah, thank you for the question, Gina.
I'll make a couple comments and then
I'll turn turn it to uh Luis. Um, first
of all, you know, 09, you know, I know
that the the standard is typically 05.
Interesting enough, FDA leadership very
recently noted with respect to rare
diseases that 05 is relatively um
arbitrary and and actually cited 09 as
being potentially acceptable uh p value.
says that, you know, 91% of the time
you're seeing a drug effect um
particularly for rare disease. But I
would also note that one of the reasons
that we're seeing a p- value of 0.09 and
we're not seeing a p value closer to or
better than 05 is that while 168
patients are included in the analysis
here, 57 patients were excluded because
they were their their um results were um
affected by the pandemic and of course
that lowers the powering of this study
um substantially. So I I think in light
of the fact that we had to significantly
lower the powering of the study to look
at 168 versus um the the you know for
the additional 57 we would have
otherwise seen I think 09 is pretty darn
impressive and the effect of course not
just the statistical significance of 09
but the effect is really important as we
were showing a reduction in decline of
30% which over the long run will be very
very important to these families. And
one of the nice things about having
these therapies commercially available
for so long is that we get to see what
happens over the long term. As you saw
with respect to just one example of many
Varmas, you know, you looked at that for
six years and these kids are seeing you
know literally almost three years of
delay in being in a wheelchair and the
time to ventilation is significantly
different. So, what I think the outcomes
are are a couplefold when we talk to the
FCA. I really do not believe that um
that there's a risk of losing marketing
authorization. It would make very little
sense given both the the benefits we've
seen with this therapy. considering this
extraordinarily
um beneficial safety profile that we've
seen over over many years and when
considering the standard that the FDA
was very specific with us about um as
they approved bios in particular and
they were talking to Essence and they
said the standard is you you will be you
will commit to voluntarily withdrawing
marketing authorization but only in a
scenario where no relevant analyses
would confirm a clinical benefit. Of
course, we don't have that between the
real world evidence and the evidence we
we see here. So, that I don't really
think that is in the cards in a rational
world. Um, and then the real question is
can we transition this therapy from an
accelerated approval to a traditional
approval? We certainly think we have a
good argument around that. We've been um
spending an enormous amount of time
gathering data that supports this and we
think it would be the most efficient um
approach, but that will require
discussions with the agency and I can't
make a prediction on that in advance of
having good solid discussions and review
of data with the agency. Now, I said
Lisa, I'm going to turn it over to you
and I will do that, but I did go on a
bit of a monologue there.
>> No, I think you you covered it well in
there. Thank you.
We'll go next to Tazine Ahmad at Bank of
America.
>> Hi guys, good evening. Thanks for taking
my question. Mine's on the upcoming
arrowhead data. I wanted to get a sense
of uh what level of data to expect from
these early programs that you're looking
at. Um importantly, uh these indications
DM1, FSHD, etc. are ones that other
companies are pursuing. Can you give us
a sense of uh what level of data to
expect so that we can potentially start
to compare and contrast with the other
programs that are ahead of you in
development? Thanks.
>> I'll turn this over to Luis.
>> Sure. Well, uh, of course, so we'll be
showing sharing data with the single
ascending dose study and we'll be
looking at uh safety and then we'll also
have safety data for the multiple
sending dose by that time. So we'll have
PK data that's serum PK muscle PK and
then as I mentioned in my remarks we are
working to uh validate and transfer the
assays the PD assays and so that is uh
knockdown uh for DM1 and looking at um
uh splicing and then for FSHD we're
obviously looking at um downstream FSHD
uh genes. So these are um assays that we
want to validate and have through
through our pivotal studies. And so
we're we're working hard to to make sure
that these are in a in a good place so
that we when we present our PD data can
be carried through um throughout our
studies. So we're excited to see this
result and and present it to you early
next year.
>> We'll move next to Brian Abrahams at RBC
Capital Markets.
>> Hi, this is Kevin on for Brian. Uh thank
you for taking our questions. Uh so we
just had a couple on um the proposed
Seramus study. Maybe can you just
provide a little bit more color on any
key sort of trial design features left
to discuss there with the agency? You
know, how confident you are in the
protocol that you've previously
presented and what if anything could be
tweaked there and uh would you still
anticipate a potential readout uh in the
first half of next year for that study?
Thank you very much.
>> Sure, Luis.
>> Sure. I think uh in a general sense uh
the protocol design is uh will be
similar to what we've presented. We
haven't finalized it with the agency but
in general in terms of the numbers of
patients and the uh and the um protocol
for ceramics that hasn't changed. So
it's been um minor uh back and forth on
the the protocol itself. Um so as soon
as we get that study started we are
ready to enroll quickly. patients are
lined up. Um and so by as you mentioned
the first half of next year we'll start
to have um data on the effectiveness and
then um in the second half of the year
is when we'll have um the full data set
for the trial based on on starting the
trial uh soon. So we're we're hoping to
get that initiated um in the near term.
>> Our next question comes from Joe Schwarz
at Lar Partners.
>> Great. Thanks very much. Um uh
previously I think you mentioned that
there were around 75 infusion centers
around the US that were up and running
although to different degrees. Um so I
was wondering how many are active once
again after the pause and um how much
variance is there across these centers
in terms of the numbers of patients
they're treating with Levitus now?
>> Patrick you can take this one.
>> Sure. Well, when we look at the the top
sites, they continued to treat. Um, now
those less experienced sites during the
pause, they wanted to understand really
the information that caused us to pause,
but what we've seen now is the majority
of those sites are also starting to
submit enrollment forms as well.
>> We'll go next to Andrew Sai, excuse me,
Andrew Sai Jeff.
Hey, thanks for taking my questions.
Appreciate the updates. So um going back
to the PMO um franchise, can you remind
us when the mission data is for Exxon 51
and how you would define success or
failure in that study since I believe
it's a dose response study. So there's
no placebo arm. Thank you.
>> Yeah, thank you very much. So that
that's a really interesting nuance. Um
and Luis, you're going to correct me. I
believe the the readout date for mission
is 2026.
Um so to your very good point mission is
a postmarketing commitment that we have
with respect to Exxandis but unlike
essence and unlike Vandis and Amandis it
is not a confirmatory study. So there is
no confirmatory study for Exandis and
that was purposeful. the FDA in in um
some of their um memos and indicated
that what they really wanted to see not
was not a confirmation study but rather
a dose ranging study. So the there's
essentially it's dose ranging between 30
migs per kg, 100 m per even up to 200 ms
per kg. And so the result of that is
really a dose, you know, is 30 ms per kg
um the optimal dose or is 100 m per kg
the optimal dose? And so that's the um
that that's the consequence of that
study. It's not a confirmatory study and
that'll be out in 2026 and we'll we'll
go from there.
>> We'll take our next question from Saline
Richtor at Goldman Sachs.
>> Thanks for taking our question. This is
Tommy on for Salvine. Just wondering
about guidance if there is anything that
you can say on full year for Levitus and
about the um stress tests that you've
done in the past with the 900 million
PMO 500 and um separately just on
essence um you in the context of recent
events we're just wondering if you're
confidence that the FDA won't move the
goalpost here. Thank you.
>> The I'm sorry, what was the last
question? Move the goalpost for
>> for essence
>> for
>> Oh yeah. Uh I I feel you know confident
based on the fact that it was in
writing. Um the standard that we were
given was in writing. Uh in fact we had
to commit back to them in writing that
that that would be the standard. It did
not come from a reviewer. It came from
um in the first instance the head of the
neuro division and then it was cited by
um um the supervisor for the for over
neuro. So I think this was very a very
wellestablished standard that we we
have. Um plus um the you know the fact
is that these therapies have been on the
market for a number of years. We have
extraordinary real world evidence on
their use. As I think we mentioned
before this is one of the most you know
ownorous uh protocols for therapy.
>> Talk news alert exclusive Trump oust
watchdog of US housing regulator
involved in mortgage probes of his foes.
on a weekly basis and yet families in
recognition of the benefits they're
seeing um are um have a compliance rate
year over year over year that's greater
than 90%
commercially and the safety profile for
these therapies is you know just is
exceptional I think would be the fair
way to say it. So you know I don't
imagine that there'd be any reason why
the division would want to change its
standard. Um it would seem to be
unnecessary. Um, as it relates to
guidance, we're not in a place to give
broad guidance right now, but um, you
know, we feel on the stress test
concept, we continue to feel comfortable
on that stress test we talked about.
That is not our guidance for next year.
We're we're going to come together on
that. Um, I'm looking at Patrick when I
say that, but we're we're um, you we
certainly feel very comfortable about
that kind of base line concept of $500
million for um, for Levitus. Um,
anything else you want to say about
about that for the rest of the year,
Patrick?
>> Nothing new to add. Thank you.
>> We'll go next to Gil Bloom at Needam and
Company.
>> Good afternoon and thanks for taking our
question. So when should we expect to
receive data from um expression data
from patients receiving prophylactic
seramus and would any be provided from
the ISD that was conducted separately.
Thank you
>> Luis.
>> The expression data would um assuming
the study started soon would be uh late
next year just in terms of obtaining the
biopsies and and analyzing them. Um in
the study that Dr. Sauso um conducted
that biopsies were not part of that. I
think that is something that he's
looking at but that was not part of the
original study design.
>> I think that is a very good question and
a very interesting one. You know we're
the primary reason that we're looking at
the use of prophylactic seramus is the
evidence we have preclinally and some of
the early clinical data that it will
greatly enhance the safety profile of
therapy particularly for non-ambulatory
patients. But one of the things we've
seen pre-clinical, we have not seen
clinically yet because we haven't no
one's taken a tooken a performed the
biopsy yet, but with preclinally we've
seen the opportunity to potentially
greatly enhance expression which in turn
may significantly enhance benefit and
durability and the like. So we're very
interested in seeing in addition to the
safety issue which is without a doubt
the primary reason we're conducting this
study, seeing some of that expression
data as well, but that'll be a next year
event.
Next, we'll go to Yan Shu at Wells
Fargo.
>> Great. Uh, thanks for taking our
questions. Uh, just maybe a quick
followup to a prior question. Um, to
what degree uh, does FDA's reaction to
Essence uh, uh, spill over, for example,
to to Exandis 51.
Um is there a possibility that the
decision or reaction positive or
negative u is there a mechanism for it
to also apply uh to uh 51 because
there's no formal 51 confirmatory
studies and also wanted to um curious in
in your mind what is the relevance of
the president of NS Pharma u you know
their phase confirmatory trial and that
outcome um um whether that has any
implication um to to your uh uh
situation. Thank you.
>> I think the only thing I'd say about NS
Pharma and we don't know a ton about the
details other than I think it's it is
certainly proof that this division is
being rational and isn't being you know
excessively punitive for those who may
not know. And as farmer had a um a study
for a PMO that that study um did not hit
stat sig. Um I think there were some
reasons for that and I think the
division's been quite um thoughtful
about that and that's that happened some
time ago and they certainly don't seem
to be moving to do anything irrational.
To your first question the question is
an interesting one. you know, do do you
think the outcome of essence has some
read through in some way to Exandis? And
the short answer is no. It doesn't
either positive or negative. I don't
think it gives us a great mechanism to
immediately um make Exxandus, you know,
traditional approval if we're able to
get the traditional approval for Vionis
and Amandis. Likewise, I don't think it
has any other negative read through to
Exandis at all for the simple reason
that that the essence is specifically
for two therapies viandis and amandis
that you know we're in that the study
and exandis doesn't have that kind of
study the againis was approved with a
post marketing commitment to look at
dose ranging um we'll have an
opportunity to talk about transitioning
to a traditional approval with exandus
but only after we've completed our post
marketing commitment to look at th that
dose ranging study of the 3100 and even
up to 200 um and then look at the you
know the benefits of that versus you
know the downsides of you know extra
dosing and the the time that it takes to
infuse. So, we'll look at all of that
and that'll be its pathway to a
traditional approval if things go well
there. But, um, it essence doesn't ever
read through there as far as we can see
logically.
>> We'll move next to Mike Ols at Morgan
Stanley.
>> Uh, good afternoon. Thanks for taking
the question. Uh maybe just to follow up
on essence in terms of timelines here,
you know, when could you potentially
meet with the FDA and when would you
expect to roughly have a final decision
on uh on that on the PMO franchise?
Thanks,
>> Luis. You want to take that?
>> Sure. So, the the meeting request will
go in by the end of the year. So, the
the meeting will take place uh sometime
in the first uh quarter based on that
request. And so then um later in the um
in the spring this final CSR will be
submitted um and then the outcome of the
the meeting with the agency will
determine next steps. So we'll we'll
update when we have something due to
share but the meeting will will happen
in the first quarter of the year.
>> We'll go next to Brian Scorny at Beard.
>> Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for
taking the question. Um I guess uh you
know the study's been running for for 10
years now and the original design um was
six minute walk and I don't think it was
changed to this fourstep ascend velocity
until under just under a year ago. Um
and prior to that wasn't flagged as a
secondary endpoint. So I guess was
switching the endpoint a mistake what is
the six-minute walk data look like and
and what was the rationale last year for
changing the analysis?
>> Luis, you want to take this?
>> Sure. Yeah. So the um we evaluated the
endpoints following our uh Levitus
embark data and so we did an analysis of
of endpoints and engaged external um kos
to help us do that. uh moving to a an
end endpoint that was perhaps more
sensitive in this and um based on the
data we picking the four stair climb
versus a six-minute walk test was the
right decision in terms of um it was
determined to be the most sensitive
endpoint in our in our hierarchy and I
think the additional analyses we did um
for both a COVID perspective and a
prognostic scoring method also showed
that uh when you applied those
thresholds we see that the um in terms
of COVID we almost reached significance
and then when we did it with prognostic
scoring meth uh method we did see that
we reached significance so it was
certainly the right end point for the
study
>> we'll go next to borrowl at cowan
>> good afternoon guys thanks for taking
the question um I wanted to dig in a
little further on the dynamics that will
drive the down quarter next quarter can
can Can you elaborate on um I guess the
the changes in shipment? I mean, is this
sort of a a lag on the
delay that the um the disruption or the
shipping disruption caused or is it
something more fundamental? And sort of
wrapped in all of this is how is safety
monitoring around ALIS changing for the
ambulatory patients? Are you finding
that clinicians are sort of adopting
these new monitoring
suggestions that were detailed in World
Muscle um for ambulatory patients and is
that slowing things down? Thanks.
>> Yeah, I'm going to turn this over to
Patrick. I mean, let me say in the
broadest of stroke you too, it it is the
downstream tale that occurs when you
have this massive disruption. And I know
people were a bit surprised that we were
resistant to this temporary pause. Um,
but you can see the the impact. We had a
temporary pause for a very short period
of time, but that really creates a
significant downstream um disruption.
We've said many times the process to go
from start form to infusion can be four
to six months. So there's just a
resonating impact when you have a just a
complete pause and then you have to re
um uh you know restart everything. But
Patrick, you can provide more nuance
than I can on this.
>> Absolutely. And and I'll add in addition
what Doug just shared. We have um really
three dynamics this quarter. one the
medical conferences to where many of our
HCPs are out of their offices for many
days, you know, weeks at a time. Um,
we've got also the major holidays that
are going to impact uh infusions. And
then uh the third is the inevitable um
illnesses that can pop up this time of
the year. So all that comes together and
it's what we've seen last year as well
could impact this quarter's infusions.
And so that's why we're projecting this
quarter to be flat to possibly down in
the fourth quarter.
>> We'll go next to David Wang at Deutsche
Bank.
>> Hi, thanks for uh taking my question.
Um, so I guess maybe following up on
some of the 11us dynamics that were
already asked about, uh, are you at a
place where you can kind of provide a
little bit of color on when you think
this demand would be normalized, um, and
and we might see an inflection in
revenues. Um, and then as you think
about some of the other competitor gene
therapy products out there, one of which
I think is seeking accelerated approval,
um, you know, sometime next year, does
that factor into kind of how you think
about how 11 demand may play out?
Thanks.
I I I'm not going to comment on nor um
editorialize on other people's claims
with their drugs, but uh as relates to
commercial performance, Patrick, perhaps
you want to provide some commentary on
that.
>> Yeah. And and the the early view is
that, you know, based on our commercial
execution and the trends that we're
seeing, it it does support that floor
that we talked about. Um, you know, as
we get further into this quarter, we'll
also, you'll see additional demands and
and additional enrollment forms come in.
And, you know, we'll be able to give it
an update u at a later time or likely uh
the JP Morgan time frame.
>> Next, we'll go to Mitchell Capore at HC
Wayright.
>> Hi, thanks for taking our questions.
This is Jade on Mitchell. Um so you
stated today that the majority of
previous elevus cancellations were
reordered. Um but can you provide the
actual hard numbers on uh the infusion
postponements versus uh the number of
cancellations you've gotten? Um and do
you have uh like an actual uh number of
start forms that have been filed for uh
this uh third quarter?
>> Yeah, we're we're we're going to use
revenue as our metric. So we're not
going to provide that that level of
detail. If you have anything to say,
Patrick, about the canceled doses, you
can certainly touch on that.
>> Yeah, so during the pause, we had 14
cancellations and we have seen 11 of
those patients rescheduled and were
redosed within uh the uh August time
frame and the remainder are still
working through the system.
Next we'll go to Baron Amen at Piper
Sandler.
>> Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my
questions. I had a question on essence.
Based on if uh patients miss doses due
to COVID, then you should expect
distrophin production on western blot
and percentage of distrophin positive
fibers to also be impacted between COVID
and non-COVID uh patients. However, you
know, there was an analysis um that I
think the company presented interim data
on at the World Muscle meeting October
at week 48. That analysis showed no
impact for 43 patients um that were
randomized to either Mandis or placebo
on exxon skip and production, distrophin
positive fibers, distrophin intensity.
Each of these end points were p value
six. So I just want to kind of
understand how do you correlate that
interroandis data on these biomarkers to
the final functional data where you did
see a co impact. Thanks
>> do you want to comment on that?
>> Yeah a couple of points on that. So
we'll um once we have all of the final
data we can certainly do a sensitivity
analys. I think one thing to remember is
that um the patients didn't have um
there's not a single patient that had
biopsies at each time point. So it's
difficult to track. So all patients had
baseline biopsies and then a subset had
them at 48 and another at 96. And so
once we have all the data we can go back
and look for sensitivity um to see if
there was an impact on on just different
expression. But um it is complicated by
the fact that not every um that patients
didn't have sequential biopsies um in
the in the study in terms of 48 and 96
weeks. there were separate patients.
>> We'll go next to Gavin Clark Gardner at
Evercore.
>> Hey guys, I just wanted to follow up on
the 11ish trajectory question. So, um,
acknowledging there could be a four to
six month lag as you noted. Have you
seen a pickup in Star Forums over the
last one to two months that gives you
confidence there will be a notable
revenue pickup in 2026?
Patrick,
>> we're starting to see sites um identify
patients and and send in uh their
enrollment form. Every patient has a
very distinct journey that they have to
go through. So, it's the antibbody
screening and the testing and their
pre-screening before they even start the
authorization process. And so uh the
early trends are uh supporting the you
know the positive outlook and as we get
more data we'll share at a later time.
>> Our next question comes from Mike Yel
Yamovitz at city.
>> Hi this is Joan Kim. Thanks for taking
our question. Maybe just two quick ones
from us regarding 11. Can you speak on
whether you're you're currently seeing
prescribed reduced prophylactically for
ambulatory patients and for
non-ambatians? Can you remind us on the
latest thinking around balancing the
potential higher risk of infection for
using and if there's any discussion
amongst Kos or FDA does not utilize
prophylactically and all non patients
giving this risk. Thank you.
Um all right with respect to the the
latter question on the United that'll be
the outcome of our study. We feel
pretty confident going into it that the
risk benefit is going to justify the the
prophylactic induces but we'll only know
that when the study reach out and we'll
look at that those issues versus
potential um issues associated with you
know risk of infection. I will say that
to your first question, we only we don't
have a systematic look at what
physicians might be using prophylactic
strollness. There we definitely have
anecdotal evidence that a significant
number particularly more sophisticated
physicians have used it and what we're
hearing at least anecdotally is that
they're not having a lot of problems
with the use of serum.
So what we've at least heard anecdotally
is that there some are using it and they
are um finding it very manageable and
and keeping the benefits from it. But
this all has to be confirmed and we have
a study that we're going to start when
we get the go ahead with the FDA which
hopefully again will be very soon and
then um we'll be off and then we'll get
the data back and we get to review it
and if we um are confident that it's
significantly changed the risk benefit.
We certainly have a lot of conviction
that could then we're going to talk to
the FDA and start testing non-ambulatory
patients again.
We'll go next to Sammy Corwin at William
Blair.
>> Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my
questions. Um, given the turnover at
FDA, I you know, I understand that you
had written guidance previously from the
head of neuro, but I guess when was the
last time you interacted with a division
regarding the essence trial and then
just curious on the percent of patients
that missed consecutive doses in the uh
essence trial that were that were in the
non-COVID group. Thank you.
as relate to that second issue on the
consecutive doses. I think it more than
doubled or around doubled in the co
period versus the co period. Um we
haven't you know we haven't had any
specific discussions other than
administrative related discussions with
the agency regarding estimates over you
know the last bit of time certainly not
in the last six months I don't believe
unless at least corrects me but again I
think we're working with the you know I
know you you've seen you know editorial
you see all this sort of um turmoil at
the FDA leadership level recently over
the last few days but I think at the
division level. That's where this
decision is going to be made and I, you
know, confident that the professionals
in that the the division are going to um
take a careful look at this and I think
we're going to be in good shape with
respect to marketing authorization
and I'm hopeful that we'll actually be
in good shape when we talk to them about
transitioning from accelerated approval
to traditional approval.
>> Next, we'll go to Kristen Kuska at Canra
Fitzgerald.
Hi, this is Rick Miller on for Kristen.
Thanks for taking our question. Just one
here uh to follow up on the mission
trial you said could read out next year
for Exandis. Do you have any insight on
how the FDA might look at any of these
dose ranging data you could generate
there? Would you plan to meet with the
agency after that trial and just any
insight you can give on what that
conversation might look like?
>> Yeah. And I think it's going to look at
the totality of the evidence from that
study and just ask the question is the
um is there a benefit to these patients
by increasing the dose perhaps to 100
migs per gig versus the 30 migs per gig
and you know it's going to be a totality
of that evidence about whether that
occurs or not. On the one hand there
might be a benefit we might see some
benefit either functionally or an
expression. On the other hand, you know,
it has to be it has to rise to a certain
bar because we are seeing a benefit from
electronic 30 days per day and that
already takes nearly an hour a week. If
you start increasing the dose to 100 200
is probably not actually viable uh for
these patients. The amount of time that
you're infusing these kids is enormous
and the the imposition is extraordinary.
So that's the only thing we have to look
at and then together decide if you know
I mean the good news is we're going to
be completely aligned in our view agency
and us if 100 m per kid was superior to
30 m per kid for these kids and the risk
benefit and the uh administrative issues
justified it we'd be fine like that but
we need to look at that data very
carefully. So again, the mission is not
a confirmatory study. The result of
mission will either be we're going to be
continuing to um distribute um extandis
at 30 minutes per kick or we're going to
be distributing ext.
>> And next we'll go to Annie Chan at Wolf
Research.
Thank you for taking the question. Uh
this is Brendan on for Andy. Regarding
your floor assumptions on leverage
sales, to what degree are you factoring
competitive pressures um from from
emerging therapies? Thank you.
>> We've considered emerging therapies.
>> Again, this is just a stress test. It's
not our guidance. Um it's just you know
this is a this is the a number that we
would be very comfortable we'd be in
fine financial shape we'd be able to
maint day revolver and you know our dash
and advance all of our programs. So um
feeling very comfortable about that
floor
>> and that concludes our Q&A session. I
will now turn the conference back over
to Doug for closing remarks.
>> Well, thank you all very much for
spending some time with us this evening.
We all look forward to continuing to
update you as we go through the rest of
this year and we'll have some additional
milestones and as we look forward into
next year. We'll provide updated
guidance next year of course and then
we're really excited um early next year
to provide you
real great [ __ ] face.
Why? Why me?

morning, right?
Turned that frown upside down.
Cure bounced 50%. Low
was cure really 15 bucks. You could have
doubled your money in cure today.

Now we will be friends.
Oh, Korean help.

I see what you're saying. It would take
a few weeks for the market to get it.
Yeah, that's probably true.
For the market to understand the
situation.
