Hello pretty peoples.  KawaJapa no
Kyua Dorii desu. I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa.
Today we are going to talk about the
wa-particle versus the ga-particle. There is
a great deal written about this online and
elsewhere, and most of what is written is
correct. Unfortunately, the thing that you
won't read anywhere is the most
important thing of all.
All the various things that are written
about wa and ga are like discussing the
differences between a lion and an eagle
and discussing the differences in their
eye color and even big differences like
the differences in their size and weight,
but never mentioning the most vital
fact – the fact that
one is a bird and the other is a mammal.
And the wa- and ga-particle are like
this. They are not simply two different
particles. They are two different kinds
of particle,  two different classes of
particle. They have an entirely different
species of function. The ga-particle
is what I call a logical particle. The
wa-particle is a non-logical particle
What do I mean by that?
Logical particles in Japanese are called
Kakujoshi: this means case-marking
particles. It's not a very useful term if
you are not familiar with the concept of
grammatical case. I find it much more
useful to call them "logical particles".
I call them logical particles because
they tell us the logic of a sentence. It
is the logical particles that tell us
who is doing what to whom. They tell us
what is where. They tell us what is going
where. They
tell us what is what. Everything that
logically binds a sentence together in
Japanese is handled by the logical
particles. This makes it a very
straightforward language, in fact. You are
probably aware of the function of the
logical particles already. The main
logical particle is ga. That is the one
that has to be in every Japanese
sentence. It is not a sentence without it,
although we know we won't necessarily
see it explicitly. The second most
prominent particle is wo. That tells
us the receiver of the action. So if I
say watashi ga
Mearii wo kisu shimashita,  I'm saying
I kissed Mary. Ga is marking me as
the doer of the action and wo is
marking Mary as the receiver of the
action. These are logical particles – ni, he, de
and all those other particles that
tell us what an action is doing, where
it's going, where it's taking place, are
logical particles. So what do we mean
when we say that wa is a non-logical
particle? I started to introduce this at
the end of our last lesson. We took the
two sentences: Doyoubi wa Toukyou ni ikimasu
and Toukyou wa doyoubi ni ikimasu.
The first of the sentences means: As for
Saturday,  I'm going to Tokyo,  and the
second means: As for Tokyo, I'm going
there on Saturday.  In both sentences the
same thing is happening, isn't it? In both
sentences, I am going to Tokyo on
Saturday. When we change the wa-particle
from one noun to another, we don't
change the actual logic of the sentence,
we only change its weight or value. What we are
literally changing is the topic. In the
first case, the topic is Saturday. In the
second case, the topic is Tokyo. But the
action of the sentence, the logic of the
sentence – what's actually happening, who
is going where – has not changed. If we
change a logical particle from one noun
to another, we change the logic of the
sentence. We change what's actually going
on, what's actually happening in the
sentence. Now, let us look at the structure
of these non-logical connections. As we
know, the top sentence analyzes to:
Doyoubi wa ø ga Toukyou ni ikimasu.
This gives us the necessary ga and
makes explicit the actor who is doing
the action. Now we can make the sentence
into a completely logical sentence very
easily:
Doyoubi ni ø ga Toukyou ni ikimasu.
Once we do this the sentence is entirely
bound together with logical particles,
isn't it? The ni that tells us when
something happens, the ga that tells us
who the actor is who is actually
doing that something, and the ni that
tells us where someone or something is
going to. But that is not how this sentence is
structured. The first noun, the dyoubi,
is a wa-marked topic, not a logical element.
Now let us take an even simpler sentence
just to analyze how this actually works.
The simple sentence we will take is:
watashi wa Sakura desu. As you know, this
analyzes to: watashi wa
ø ga Sakura desu. And we can see that
this statement in fact has two elements.
The main element is: ø ga Sakura desu. This
is a complete statement
in itself. It has the doer, which is
ø, it has the ga which binds the
sentence together and it has the thing
done, which is being Sakura. Sakura desu.
This statement is perfect. It's complete in
itself and we don't actually need
anything else. You might notice that at
the beginning of each lesson I
introduce myself: KawaJapa no
Kyua Dorii desu.  I don't say watashi wa
KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu, because
in this context it is quite unnecessary
and would in fact add a certain emphasis
which I am not trying to add. So, Sakura
desu, which analyzes to ø ga Sakura
desu, is complete in itself, but in this
case the speaker has decided to add
another element, and that is watashi wa.
Watashi wa is not logically
connected to the rest of the sentence.
The connection between them is that
watashi wa is the topic, the stated topic,
and the rest of the sentence is the
comment on the topic.
Speaking of me, I am Sakura.
Just as in English, there's no logical
connection between those two, no
grammatical connection.
I am Sakura is a complete statement in
itself.
"Speaking of me" does not have a
grammatical link, but in Japanese it does
have a grammatical link. It does not have
a logical link, but it does have a
grammatical link, and this is the important
thing to remember. In English, what I'm
calling a logical link and a grammatical
link are the same thing, but in Japanese
they are not. The topic-comment
structure IS grammar, but it's not logical
grammar. And this in fact is what we mean
when we talk about choosing between wa
and ga. There is always an unseen
ga in any case, but we are choosing
whether to make a topic-comment
statement or a logical statement.
And let us note, as we have already seen,
that there are in fact three ways to say this
particular thing. We can say: Sakura desu,
which means: ø ga Sakura desu. We can say:
watashi wa Sakura desu, or we can say:
watashi ga Sakura desu. And each
of these ways of saying it has a
slightly different implication, and
that's what we are going to discuss next
time.  Knowing the mechanics of how this
actually works is going to help us a
lot in understanding those implications.
There are various implications involved
in what is called the choice between
wa and ga, which is really the choice of
whether to append a topic to the
complete sentence. And we should remember
also that the choice is usually not
between simply wa and ga. It is between
wa and ga or just leaving the zero
pronoun and zero particle to do its work
without anything in front of it. Thank
you for attending this lesson. If you
