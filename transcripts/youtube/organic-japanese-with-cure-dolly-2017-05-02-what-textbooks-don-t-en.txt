Hello, pretty peoples. KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii.
I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa.
Today I am going to tell you the things
that the schools and textbooks don't
tell you about Japanese, because once you
know these things it's going to be much,
much easier. It will cut a path through
Japanese grammar for you.
So we'll start right away with the very
simplest Japanese sentence. If you are
new to Japanese, you won't know this. If
you have been studying Japanese for some
time, you still may not know it, because
the schools and textbooks don't
usually explain this properly. If you're
lucky, you will start to know it by
instinct over time, but I know people who
have been studying Japanese for quite a
while
who don't understand this yet and get
all the particles wrong. And if you get
the particles wrong in Japanese, you get
everything wrong, because the particles
are the glue that holds Japanese
together. They are the linchpins of the
language. All right, so the simplest
Japanese sentence always consists of two
things. In Japanese they are called shugo and
jutsugo. In English they are called subject
and predicate. But a lot of people aren't
comfortable with that terminology even
in English, so I'm going to put it in a
simpler way. The two things that you find
in any Japanese sentence are a thing
that is doing something or being
something and what it is doing or being.
Those are the two things. So even if you say
"There is a rabbit", you have two things.
There is the rabbit, and there is what it is
doing – and what it is doing in this case is
just being. "There is a rabbit", but it has
those two things, and it's the same in
Japanese. Those two things, the thing that
is doing something and the thing that is
being done, are connected together with
the ga-particle. They are always connected
together with the ga-particle. No other
particle. That is what the ga-particle
does. It connects together the thing that
is doing or being with what it does or
what it is. So we can say "inu ga hashiru", that means
"the dog runs". We can say "hana
ga akai", that means "flower is red". We
can say "usagi ga arimasu", "there is a
(toy) rabbit". We can say "tori ga tonde iru",
"bird is flying". Notice that each of these
sentences is joined together with ga.
Every Japanese sentence is joined
together with ga. Now, at this stage some
of you are saying, "but I have seen a lot
of Japanese sentences with no ga in
them." That's true –
the ga does not always appear in writing
or in speech, but it is always, always
there. It is what we call the logical
ga, and it is always logically there.
If we understand this, we understand the
basis of Japanese grammar. If we don't, we
are going to get very, very lost. So, let's
take an example of a sentence with no
apparent ga. A Japanese sentence can
have no more than a single word in it.
For example, "tsukareta" – that means
"became tired". The full meaning of the
sentence, however, is "watashi ga
tsukareta" – "I became tired".  "Became tired"
on its own does not mean anything,
does it?
It has to have a shugo, a subject.
"Tsukareta" is the thing being done,
"becoming tired". The doer, the subject, the
shugo is in this case: me, I, watashi.
So what about a sentence like "watashi wa
nihonji desu", that means "I am
Japanese". We have the doer, that is "I", and
we have the thing being done, that is
"being Japanese",  but we have no ga.
Actually we do have a ga, but in order to
understand that, we need to know how wa
actually works, and that is the subject
of next week's class. For now, I want you
to trust me that there is always a ga
in every sentence whether you can see it
or not.
You won't have to trust me for very long
because I am going to prove it to you.
However, the ga structure of the
Japanese sentence is
fundamental. Not only does every sentence
have a doer, a thing done, and a ga
joining them, but that is the core of
every single Japanese sentence. There may
be many other things in a sentence,
but all those other things are simply
telling us more about the shugo, the doer,
or more about the jutsugo, the
thing that is done. Now, if there is
anything you did not understand or you
wish to ask any questions, please put
them in the comments below and I will
answer you. If you want to understand all
of this very clearly, may I take the
liberty of recommending my book
"Unlocking Japanese". It is a short book
– you can read it in one or two evenings –
but it will make Japanese clearer, simpler,
and more understandable for the rest of
your life. Thank you for attending this
lesson. Please look forward to the next one.
