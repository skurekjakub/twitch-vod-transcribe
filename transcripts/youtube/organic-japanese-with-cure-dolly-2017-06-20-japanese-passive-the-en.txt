Hello. pretty peoples. KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu. I am
Cure Dolly from KawaJapa. Today we are going to talk about the so-called
passive form of Japanese verbs. The
first thing to know about this is that
it is NOT passive. This is extremely
important. In Japanese the so-called
passive is called the ukemi, which means
"the receiving body" and this is exactly
what it is. It is the receptive form of
verbs. What does this mean and why does
this matter?
First of all, let's look at why it
matters. It matters because it not only
makes the passive itself much more
complicated than it needs to be – it
introduces apparently random rules into
what is in fact a completely
straightforward piece of grammar – but
more importantly than that, it confuses
our entire grasp of how Japanese really
works. As I have explained you from the
beginning, the ga-particle is the heart
of every Japanese sentence, whether
you can see it or not. Every Japanese
sentence hinges on the ga. The structure
of Japanese grammar is ga-structure. Now,
when we treat the receiving form of
verbs as passive, it completely throws
that into chaos and confusion. Suddenly
ni is doing what ga ought to do and
ga is doing something inexplicable. But
in fact the receptive form of Japanese
verbs is not passive, so this actually
isn't really happening at all. Let me
explain. Let's take an English passive
sentence: "I was hit by Mary." That is an
actual passive sentence, and the actor of
that sentence is Mary and the receiver
of the action is me. This is not what the
Japanese receptive is doing.
Let's take another English sentence: "I received a blow from Mary." Now the meaning is the
same, but this is NOT a passive sentence, is it?
The action of the sentence is receiving
the blow, and the person who does that is
not Mary, it's me. And this is how the
Japanese receptive tense works. Let's
put it into Japanese: "Watashi wa Mary ni booru wo nagerareta." Who is the
doer of this sentence? The doer of
the sentence is me. I am the one who
throw-received the ball. So why is Mary marked by ni? In our lesson on ni, we showed
how ni marks the indirect object of the
verb. So if we say "I threw the ball at
Mary," the ball is what I threw and the
ultimate target of that action is Mary.
"Watashi ga Mary ni booru wo nageta."
However, in a receiving sentence the
actor of the sentence is the receiver
and the ultimate target of that sentence
is replaced by the ultimate source. In a 
receiving sentence, the target changes
places with the source, and that's the
only change in Japanese grammar that
takes place in the receiving form. The doer, the throw-receiver, is marked by ga, as
the doer of a sentence always is. The
direct object, the ball, the thing that
was actually thrown, is marked by wo, as
the direct object of a sentence always
is. The ultimate target of the sentence,
since it is a receptive sentence, is the
ultimate source of the action and that
is marked by ni. So now we see that the
receptive sentence is not confusing
at all, and it does not throw Japanese
grammar into complete confusion. It only
does that if you insist on regarding it
as if it were an English passive
sentence, which it is not. Very well. Now,
the English language textbooks treat the
receptive form as if it were a
conjugation of the verb, but in Japanese
that's not how we see it. In Japanese
there is a helper verb – reru or areru –
which can be put onto the end of
any verb. If it's an ichidan verb
we replace the ru with rareru;  if it's a
godan verb we attach reru to
the plain past stem of the verb, that is,
the a-ending stem of the verb.
And once we've done that, we have
created a compound verb that means
receiving the action of the original
verb. In English this is done, but it's
relatively rare. We can talk about
receiving a blow or receiving a present.
We don't usually talk about receiving
the drinking of something or receiving
something being said, but in Japanese
we do. There is a helper verb that is
commonly used and can turn any ordinary
verb into a receptive verb. So let's see
how that works in a case where we
wouldn't usually use "receive" in English:
"Mizu ga inu ni nomareta." In English
this would usually be translated as "The
water was drunk by the dog," and probably
there is no other natural way of
translating it into English.
That's all right, but if we imagine that what it actually MEANS is "The water was drunk
by the dog," Japanese grammar is thrown
into chaos and confusion. What it
actually means is "The water drink-received from the dog." The actor, the
subject, the doer, of this sentence is not
the dog. It is the water. Now, I realize
that this comes as a surprise to many
Western learners of Japanese, but it
should not come as a surprise to you. I
have explained in detail in my lesson on
the structure of Japanese how Japanese
does not have the same very strong
preference for the actor or doer of a
sentence to be a person or even
necessarily an animate being. It is 
the failure to understand this that is
the root cause of a very large
proportion of the confusion and
misunderstanding that surrounds the
learning of Japanese in the West.
In Japanese we have a receptive helper
verb which can and often is added to other verbs
to make them receptive. Once we
understand this, we understand how
Japanese is perfectly logical and
regular, and the so-called passive, the
receptive form, is very easy to form, to
understand, and to know which particles
to use. If you have any questions, please
ask them in the comments below and I
will answer. And remember that the course book for this course of lessons is
"Unlocking Japanese". You can get it from
Amazon in Kindle or paperback editions,
and we recommend reading the book along with following this course of lessons.
Thank you for attending this class. Kore
