Well, hello, good morning. How are you? What is up?

How's it going? What day is it guys? What day is it? You know what day it is.

Rebecca, remind us what day it is.

It's my friends, looking in the front seat, looking in the back seat.

Fried, yeah! Looking forward to the weekend.

We are German on the highway.

Yeah, hello, hello, van. We are having so much fun.

Are you having fun? Let's see if Disney has a good day.

I think Disney's gonna have a good day, but we shall see.

Alright, let's run it.

Thank you for MNTS yesterday. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Give it a day or two, okay, asshole?

Yeah.

Disney zero day 112 call? Ooh, imagine. Imagine.

That's right. If you forgot when Sunday comes,

that's when you're gonna have a good day.

That's when you're gonna have a good day.

That's when it comes.

So chilling in the front seat.

I have to roll my Verizon calls. I'm getting killed.

Ooh, the dancing alien's back.

Verizon is now run by the PayPal CEO?

Yeah, I know. It's like, it's like, it's come back to haunt me.

What did Simba say to the driver?

I don't know.

Here it comes.

Mufasa? Oh God, get the fuck out.

You know what? Hold on.

Alright, that's it. I'm un-VIPing all the women,

so I don't have to see what they say anymore.

Shut up, techno-queef of Tesla.

Alright, ding, ding.

Ding, ding, ding. We are live.

Alright, so we got a few things running right now.

For those of you guys that are degents,

we're gonna go ahead and pop right on in.

We've got, hold on.

Let's just check our Joby calls we took yesterday.

Those are looking good.

Shit, I gotta sell a lot of things. Hold on.

Come Congress cannot figure out how to pass AI regulations

or cryptocurrency regulation.

Can't figure out or refuse to figure it out?

Big difference there.

Alright, so let's go ahead and look at what we got here.

We've got a few things moving.

We got Kodak looking good. We got Piton up.

We got Mir back up.

We've got Fly at 420 now.

NNDM looking really good.

Hut pushing for 50.

Dude, I think I'm up 600% on...

I'm gonna sell my NNDM calls.

I think I'm up 600% on those shares now.

We also got a lot moving.

Over here as well.

Let's go ahead and look at what we've got here.

I am in CatX this morning, which is flying.

I'm also in Orbs, which absolutely went insane.

And I'm hoping it has another run here.

AMAT is the main one I'm focusing on today.

And then Disney as well.

And Disney's already moving.

These are because of the news that we talked about.

Disney charging more for their parks now.

And we've got AMAT with more China curbs.

Potentially going to be one that people are jumping in on.

Also jumped into Doximity this morning.

They got downgraded and fell pretty hard.

They're up about 3% right now.

So I'm going to go ahead and put my trailing stop loss at 1% on these.

And be done with it.

Let's see trailing stop loss on Doximity.

Let's go ahead and show the percent one.

That was a nice little catch there.

CatX is still moving.

This is my main play today.

It's a little bit different than what I usually play.

But I'm up about 6% right now.

So I'm going to go ahead and put a total stop loss of this of 5%.

Normally I would tier this, but it's a little bit volatile.

So I'm just going to put this here.

It comes off of an initiation that they got.

Which was pretty wild.

And then my other main play is Orbs.

This is one that had some pretty big news.

And a recent investment from BMNR.

So this went up.

I'm up about 5% on it right now.

I'm going to go ahead and put a 7% trailing stop loss on that.

And those are the three that I am in from premarket.

And keeping a very close eye on Disney and AMAT today.

And already stopped out of dox.

That's cool.

AMAT right there. Disney coming back down.

QQQ's still going for record highs.

Let's see what we got.

Wow.

Verizon really fucking reversed there, huh?

Alright.

CatX moving up again.

Are you still holding MNTS?

Yes. Why? I haven't looked at my portfolio this morning.

I think Disney is going to be a surprise one today.

I want to be very careful with it, but I think it's a surprise day today.

Wow. Verizon.

What a fucking rebound that was from this morning.

Holy shit.

Let's see what happens here.

I have to roll these calls.

I think it's going to rebound very, very sharply.

But I think it might take a little while.

As a dad of a young kid, everyone is going to Disney.

Price be damned.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

Absolutely.

There's no question that people are going to...

I mean, I was actually surprised.

I've been doing this a long time.

I was surprised to know how much of their revenue actually comes from...

Oh, I could get my next leg in on Poet.

How much of their revenue actually comes from parks.

You'd think it wouldn't be as much as it was.

You'd think that...

It just was insane.

All right.

SoFi is now $29, ladies and gentlemen.

We are now up 170% on that.

Of course, it would be much more if we didn't average up.

Hive, we are now up 200% on Hive after being down on that for so long.

NVX, this run, we're up 60%.

NNE, great bounce back from under 27.

TSSI, this is the new one that we're getting in for AI and data centers

that we think is...

is next on the docket.

Up 15% on those shares.

So we had a nice one there.

Walmart, nice bounce back here.

We got MLTX going again.

We got a lot.

But NVX back to 252, guys.

This is the one that my fellow graphite barons,

that we've been in this for a long time.

Our HUT shares are about 600% now.

Dpro hit almost $15 this morning,

which is absolutely wild.

UUU, $21.

Insane run that we've been in on this one.

We've been in because of the private garbage trucks for rich people a while back.

I think we're up about 75% on that.

And so everything is looking really nice.

Boeing bouncing back here.

Gilt going for $14.50 again.

Alright.

Let's see what we got moving right now.

Oh shit, I got stopped out of orbs.

No! No!

No! No! Don't do that to me!

Fuck!

Alright, I'm gonna put a buy order back the same place I had it earlier.

And see if I get filled again.

Are you selling any UUU shares?

No. I think, I told you yesterday,

I think that even though UUU is absolutely in...

Oh my, oh my, oh shit!

My Levi puts. Oh god, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.

Oh no!

You know what's crazy?

Yesterday on stream, I said I was gonna take puts for Levi through earnings.

And I had 15 of them.

I put a buy order for 5 more,

and I hit sell order. So I only have 10 left.

What are you talking about?

When the doctor was sewing you up, I said,

hey, hey, don't sew it, you know,

don't sew it all the way closed. He goes, why?

It's fourth hole Friday, doc.

Oh my god.

This is my legacy.

Alright, Hive now,

at 760, guys, we are now

up 200 and

5% on those.

Do NVX another

16% now.

CatX, we're still in, moving

really nicely. And TSSI up 3.5%.

2027 $10

Poet leaps. I did a whole whiteboard yesterday

on why Poet is probably not going

to have the same kind of move

as Open Door. It's too diluted

with buyers right now.

But that being said, I still think that

we're in that, remember that downswing cycle

where there's going to be liquidity coming in if it happens?

And that's why I'm legging in right now.

But I'm not going to be keeping this. There goes Amat.

That was our main focus for...

Am I going to get bailed out a third time?

I got bailed out on Amazon

and Joby.

Am I going to get bailed out on Verizon?

Oh, speaking of which,

okay. What are we doing with these

Kodak leaps? I don't fucking know.

You took Disney zero

day calls? You fucking...

Are you okay?

Stocky needs to be studied? What the fuck?

NVX? What are you talking about?

He needs to be studied. Bro, we

had to up and down trade this shit

for...

for like a year almost.

Target needs to go? I'm out of

Target already. What's the deal with

CatX?

So...

Morning Call is open on Friday.

So if you want to go to Friday Freebies,

you can hear the recording about why I took

CatX. It was literally

just a crazy initiation.

That's the only thing that made me

take it. Actually, it's a toe for YOLO today.

So that's why I took it.

It wasn't even like a main play. Orbs

was my main play because of the news.

And I didn't sell it pre-market when I was up

14%, so I only got like 5.5%

out of it. I have another buy order

for this again. I know it's up 25%, but

this is the type of play or type of

stock that

could really, you know,

take off again. Just because, even though it's up

25%, the whole thing is

that they launched a new pilot

program for their advanced AI

authentication programs. And

this is a month after BM&R,

which is insane right now. The whole

idea behind BM&R is insane.

BM&R actually invested $20 million

into them as well. So they've got a couple catalysts.

And so, that's why

I really like this. I'm not...

I'm waiting for it to come down before I buy again. If I

miss a second run, I miss a second run.

AMAT, I said, was my favorite one today

just because of the China curves and Disney because of

the park news.

That's kind of the ones I'm focusing on today.

Oh shit, I got confirmation that Rokhan

is going to be here at 12 on Monday

for 30 to 45 minutes.

Thanks for the UUUU signal,

Stocky. Easy 50%. Okay,

buddy. So what I'm going to do is

I'm going to open up our channel in Discord.

I get him for a good period

of time, actually.

So I get another sitting

congressperson

on the stream for 30 to 45

minutes. And we've already discussed

other than very specific

things that we don't really want to bring up because

we've hashed out already.

It's pretty much an open forum.

So I'm basically going to talk to him about

what I told him

I want to talk to him about is

congressional stock

trading,

the budget,

things about the budget, like what's going on,

how do you guys figure this out, what are you

thinking, ideas on how they come to

certain terms. I might slip in the

Epstein thing. You think I should ask

about the Epstein thing since he co-sponsored

the bill? I really don't want to

get too much into the APAC thing.

I don't mind touching on it,

but I feel like that's more of a

you know, if you start

talking about that outside of just like

one big special interest group,

it starts to come across as you've got

an agenda, and I don't really want

that to come across. So I don't mind bringing that up, but

deep diving into that, that's not my

that, you know, using

APAC and others as an example of like, okay,

these special interest groups and how much influence

they have is fine, but like I think some people

would want me to go way deeper into that, and that's

not the content I do.

Afraid of what? You think I'm afraid of

anything? No, I'm not afraid. It's about

the brand. You don't go off brand.

Alright, so what I'm going to do is

I'm going to go into Discord, and I'm going to go into

the, where it says

Sue Ennis. I'm going to change that to Ro Khanna.

I hope I don't mess it up, and I'm going to

let you guys put questions in there today.

and in the weekend, and I'm going to pick

from there for some questions from you guys.

Okay, here we go.

I guess verified?

Oh, whoops, I should have taken it. I don't know.

What do I do? I'm going to fuck this up, aren't I?

I'm going to have to have a mod fix

the channel.

Can you use this for your Twitter announcement?

Alright, we got stopped out of CatX.

Nice little play there too.

So we got two out-the-gate morning plays

this morning. I'd like,

we got stopped out of Doximity, so we had three W's this

morning. I'm looking to get back into Orbs.

I'm really deciding if I want to jump in

on AMAT or Disney today. I feel like

Disney's a better catalyst.

I know that that's stupid,

because Disney's such a shit stock, but

the last time they announced

price increases, they really had a jump.

Alright.

For those of you guys who were at the end of stream yesterday,

the, uh,

the, uh,

the last, uh, the last thing that we

did was, uh, we jumped into NNE

when it hit 4580.

And we took shares and calls.

We are up 55% on

those calls, so I'm gonna sell those now.

And we have a stop loss on the shares that we took.

That was our little, uh, end of day,

end of day trade. Still on Amazon calls?

I actually bought Amazon calls

yesterday morning, and

it, uh, it was

wild because I bought

four of them when it

went to a dollar.

And then, or six of them,

sorry, and so I sold

some, and then now

I shouldn't be, you know,

I shouldn't be playing the same positions

because it's so dangerous now, but

I wish I would have doubled down on it

because it's

65% now on them.

It topped out at 175. Yeah, I got out at

like 129 on half of them, and then

I got these left over. I'm gonna

clear these completely, although I think Amazon

has a chance for another bounce back. Uh,

I don't want to hold anything short-dated over the weekend.

Oh man, this is really,

oh, this is tempting.

Okay, my buy order keeps

not filling, and it's right there. So I think,

I think I'm just gonna

buy here, and then just set

another, uh, buy because

this is, uh, I'm waiting too long here.

Okay. Alright, AMAT

looks healthy here. Uh, other one that we wanted to

look at after open today, um,

was, uh,

BABA. BABA's had

six straight losing sessions now. Might be a

weekend play. FIG partnering with Google.

Wendy's launching a

turnaround initiative. Fuck, Disney's

gonna go, isn't it? Why do you have an

L-Counter maliciously hiding your D-Gen pics?

I love how you guys think

that everything I do is, like,

intentional on purpose, yet you watch me

every day and realize that I, I barely can turn

on my computer. Like, you think that

I'm intentionally hiding,

or maybe I just moved the fucking thing

up and forgot to put it back. Like,

like, maybe, you know,

it's like looking at your grandfather

arguing with the fucking

cable company on the phone and being like,

he's having flashbacks of NOM.

He's plotting on killing that customer's

service. Or maybe he's just like,

I remember when he thought you could talk to a

goddamn human being instead of a fucking

machine and then getting routed to some

goddamn fucking, fucking

Middle Eastern, you know, whatever, and then,

and then now I got a fucking A.I. and shit.

Like, I miss times when I could just drink

and fucking, you know, beat my wife

and, and, and, and I could live off of

a single goddamn income and, you know,

like, no. Okay, it's not always

the same thing that you're thinking, alright?

Alright. Alright, we're out

of half of our Levi puts that we took through earnings.

Um, let's see what

else we got. All in on Disney Zero

Day. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't, no, that's

not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

Alright, back in

Orbs, um, instead of a

stop loss, what I'm doing is, is I just put

half position here and I have another, um,

and I'm just gonna, where my stop loss would be, I just have

the other half, uh, to buy. So this either

moons here and I make money or it falls and I get

filled and then I put a stop loss in. There goes Disney, goddammit.

And there goes AMET. Son of a bitch, I'm sitting here

fucking being indecisive as a

little shithead. Heg set this

speaking. Oh, god. Alright, gonna

add one more AEHR call.

Can you talk about Levi? They met earnings

but cited tariffs and went down. Yeah, so

after what, uh, AEHR did, citing

tariffs and getting there, uh, I was in Levi

puts. I was actually down on Levi puts. I was

already in Levi puts before yesterday, uh,

and it was because I was worried that Trump might say

something about, um, about,

um, uh, you know,

additional tariffs over in, uh,

uh, somewhere, you know, in Asia, uh,

even if it was Vietnam or whatnot.

And so it didn't happen, uh, but

I was also watching American Eagle and others, and I was like,

man, Levi, I wonder if, you know, how this is gonna play out.

Doesn't matter. Uh, with, uh, with

the way that, uh, AEHR

talked about potential, uh, impacts of

tariffs, again, it made me think that Levi

might talk about them as well, uh,

and, and, and lower their guidance potentially,

uh, or give some kind of cautionary

tale, and so that's why I took them.

Uh, and so people are still

worried because this isn't AI, this

isn't the same sector. It's, it's

much different. It's much different. You're talking about the

retail sector. And while

corporations are eating about 65%

of the tariffs right now,

and consumers are only eating about 14% of it,

uh, it's only sustained for so long.

Plus, Levi got a huge bulk of their inventory

pre, um, uh,

pre-tariffs, so they have the inventory,

but they're running, they're gonna run out of that inventory,

and they're gonna have to buy, and they're gonna have to pay for it.

So, these corporations, especially on the retail

side, are saying, hey, you know, this

is going to be a concern. If, if these tariffs

don't get lifted or get dropped soon,

we can no longer eat these tariffs,

you know, the, the, this cost.

Without passing on to the customer, and we're

running out of our inventory that we bought.

So, we're gonna have to purchase, and we're gonna

have to pass the cost on, and that's gonna hurt our bottom

line. And so, you know,

that's kind of the worry that they're having.

All right. Got dry powder

for the weekend. Joby calls

are coming back a little bit here. Um,

Rivian bouncing

up a little bit here. We got Kodak up a little bit.

Mir coming back as well.

I took Helen of Troy yesterday. I don't

know if that was a smart decision or not yet. We're gonna

find out. Not going crazy on

anything, though. Yeah, I have to, I have to

roll my, my

Verizon calls. I still think Verizon's gonna

bounce back nicely, but I think it's just gonna take

a little bit longer than I expected.

All right. So, NVX is up

23%. What in God's

name? SoFi

going for 23.30. NNE

49. TSSi, our

new play, doing pretty well. Walmart up 1%

today. Joby up 1%.

We've got

Dpro was at almost $15

this morning. It's at $14 right now. We're up

199% on that on

the third run. So, in the past six months,

we played Dpro for 137%,

100%, and now 200%.

So, that was really nice there.

Plug

back to 380. Alts a little

bit of a gain back.

Rivian about a quarter

percent. We're back in orbs.

WeRiot holding on. UUU

up another 8%.

Ford is green. What's red?

Poet, but we grabbed some more at

818. Gilt

is red. Airy is red.

MLGO is red. It's back

under 10. NVO is red, but it's still at

58. Celsius red, down to

63. So, we're only up, what,

180% now.

Grr is red. I think

I'm going to jump back. I'm going to play a little bit of

GPUS here. Okay.

What are you rolling your Verizon to?

I haven't decided yet.

By end of day, I want to

roll them. I think I'm going to roll them

to, I mean,

the March $45 calls are pretty

cheap. $46 is ridiculously

cheap. I'm going to do it by end of day,

though. I still think Verizon,

again, what I think doesn't matter, but

I still think that Verizon is going to bounce

back. It

bounces back pretty hard whenever it falls like

this, and a lot of it has, I mean, obviously you're coming

up on Divi date right now, so people are going to be

selling because they got their ex-Divi,

but the new CEO,

big change, it's PayPal CEO, which PayPal hurt

me years ago, even though it was one of my best

all-time plays, and I just didn't

sell it. I think that was

no matter how long you're doing this,

no matter how long you're in the market, the market always changes,

the economy always changes, things change,

and you have to adapt, and you're going to learn

lessons, and I had to learn a new lesson

there. I had to

not really a new lesson, but be reminded

that if you're going to own

something, you have to babysit it, and you have

to be very honest with

yourself if you see something changing for the

negative instead of trying to grasp for the positive,

and that's something I learned. I got

into it with COVID. We thought that with

Square and all

the merchant-based payment systems that nobody

was going out to restaurants or stores anymore, everybody was locked

down or locked up in their house,

and so they were going to have to purchase things online, and

PayPal was going to be that one, and we were right.

We fucking nailed it. I mean, the stock went from 100 to

300, but then everyone

else was like, all right, well, we can also add this feature

and do this feature, and it's like PayPal, instead of

being the one doing it, they're like, no, we're good. We'll sit

back and watch, and then I watched

as everyone else became the leader

in that sector and

did not sell for 200%

or 150% or 100%,

and ended up selling last year

for 70-something dollars

and took a fucking 30% loss on my shares.

That's on me. I mean, like,

you're going to do that, you know what I mean? It's just a reminder

that if you're going to own a sizable position

in a large company, you have to be

babysitting it. That's why I tell people it's

better to just own the total market than individual companies

because if you're going to own individual companies, you've got to babysit them.

Have you ever looked at IGC,

Potential Management for Alzheimer's Disease,

which could be the next big problem for

aging population?

Let's break that down. Have you ever looked at

IGC? It sounds familiar, but I've never

broke it down. Management

for Alzheimer's Disease. There is a lot of companies

that are dealing with doing stuff with Alzheimer's.

I remember when Gilead was doing it. They had the big lead

drug on that. The next

big problem for aging

population. It's already a

big problem, but

the next round of

people are going to be dealing

with a lot of other things too

because, you know, Alzheimer's

is hereditary, and it

is affecting a lot of people, and it's

oftentimes diagnosed way too

late, but

because it is something that affects so many people, there

is a big, you know, my grandfather

died of it. He died of it, and

he was hiding it from

everybody for a while,

and then by the time we realized it was so rapid,

it was just insane. Like, I just watched

this man that was, you know,

a Marine in Vietnam. He was

a captain of homicide in Miami

Dade. He was a cop down here for 30 years.

Then he wrote books, and he was just

a strong guy. He was a

concert pianist, a

violinist. I mean, he just did it all. He just

did it all. He was a strong man, you know?

And then to just watch him,

the guy who remembered the dumbest facts

in the world, and him and I would talk about baseball

and

war and history and whatever,

to watch him

just so rapidly just

forget little things, and

then it was like

then he would forget what he was talking about,

and then he couldn't

talk, and then he just started saying things he didn't understand.

He got scared and alone, and then

the next thing I know, you know, it was over.

And it was insane.

It was insane to watch that happen.

And so, you know, it's

one of those things where a lot of people,

here's the problem, too, with a lot

of people, is that

they,

we tend to not

keep track of our family members

the more, the longer we're apart

from them, and

you do a phone call,

you know, or text or whatever,

and you meet every now and then,

and so you don't really get to see the

change, and they're always going to tell you

they're okay, because they probably don't know

something's wrong with them, or they don't want to worry you, because

they don't want you to stop your life on it,

and then by the time, sometimes it's too late.

So that's why, with things like that, it's like

always good to check on your family, keep up with them,

not just, not out of guilt, but because

you know, these things can happen, and

by the time you realize it, you're like, why didn't I know

sooner? And so, you know, keep up with

those things, okay?

Buy more guilt? No, no.

No, I'm not going to get all fucking like, it's a Friday,

I'm not going to get all like, you need to do this, and take care,

and call your family, and spend it, but

yeah, think about that with your family sometimes.

Like, I did that whole thing about how

the time you graduate and leave

home, you only, for the rest of your life,

on average, you're only going to see your family 300

more days. From the time you

leave home at 18, until they pass

away, you get 300 days with them.

And every year that goes by,

that's 10 more days that you lost.

When you're 19, you get

290 more days to see them.

When you're 20, 280 days

to see them. 21, 270

days left. So,

think about that, okay?

That's why I tell you guys,

don't put it off, because

you don't realize it until the time is too short.

Okay?

I mean, unless your family sucks. My family

is un- oh, there we go. My family is unfortunately

always unsupportive and discouraging. They have

always labeled my mental illness a drug

addiction. Okay, I don't know.

Why I gotta tune in? I wasn't trying

to make y'all depressed, man. You got me

crying in a casino right now?

Bro, no, that's not what I was doing. I was just

talking, man.

I'm just talking. Sometimes we need reminders,

bro. I'll be real with you right now.

I'm gonna say something that's gonna fuck with you even more.

If what I just said depressed

you, that means you know you're

doing something wrong. Fix it.

Call your family. Don't just

text them, okay? Older people like to

talk. They don't- they're not-

texting for them is new and it's cold.

If you're sad about

what I just said, then that means

you probably

feel guilty right now. I'm not trying to do things out

of guilt, but I'm just saying, like,

I'm just saying, like, you know, I come for the

stocks. I stay for the therapy. Motherfucker, I'm not a therapist.

I- What are you laughing at?

Your parents live with us.

I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about them.

This is why DJing Friday

sucks now? I'm so

sad I'm buying Disney Zero Days?

Guilt puts? Because I can

imagine a world where my loved ones are no longer with me.

Am I doing something wrong? No.

It just means that the world has

hurt you so much that you

automatically prepare and

are ready and assume

or at least, you know,

I wouldn't say whoever, but you

realize the inevitable and

you just have to

accept that that's an inevitability.

That's what that means.

That doesn't make you a bad person. That just means

that the world is too

real for you, alright?

Okay, we're done here. Alright, we got our second fill

here. Alright, now it's time to start

putting my stop losses in.

Alright, we're still up on the day because we had a great play earlier.

So I'm going to go ahead and put half of it at a

4% trailing stop loss.

And half of it is

7%.

I know those are pretty wide stop losses but it really

it's only a 5% or

a 5.5% stop loss.

Very volatile.

Alright, Hive back at 770.

NVX still going. What a fucking

play this has been, huh? NNE

5%. Of course I fucking sold

those NNE calls early.

Good pick up yesterday though. Two times now.

Where did I sell them at?

Just because I like to feel the pain.

I hurt myself today.

These are the 54, 10,

17s. Yeah, that kind of

sucks. What about MNTS?

I scalped it a little bit yesterday. I'm still down on it

but I'm giving it a shot.

The last time...

Wait, what? No, don't do that. The last time

that I played this, you know, back of the...

Jesus, oh god, NNE is

absolutely fucking just screaming

to the top right now. Look at this.

This is

when we bought... This is what's wild.

Right before I got off stream,

I was like, okay, I'm taking...

I'm jumping in NNE here.

And this guy goes NNE

back to 38, I bet. And

the funny thing was is that we

caught the absolute bottom

of the drop

before I got off stream.

That was the bottom.

It's like CRM all over again.

And look at this. Our

$10, $17, $54 calls are absolutely insane

right now. I'm out, I'm out.

Yes? Oh god.

She's saying that this morning

she had to wake up at 5am to cook food

because she's fasting for me.

And, um, what does

that mean? It's a weird thing.

She's not allowed

after the sun rises until

the sun sets, or until the moon.

So, from the

before the sun, from the time the sun

rises until the moon rises,

she can't even have a single drop

of water. That's it. She can't

eat, she can't drink, she can't have

anything. And then,

when the moon goes up,

her and I have to go out.

This is every year. We go

out and we have to look at the moon.

And she has to, like, look at the moon

through her fingertips or something.

And then,

she has to go down and touch

my feet. And then

she can eat. I think

it, you know, I personally,

but it's her thing and she wants to do it.

Now, I told her this year, when you go down

and touch my feet, don't come up until I'm finished.

You know what I mean? But that's just

a little different. It is what it is.

Like, I mean, this is a real thing. Some people do it.

I'm not, like, I'm not really, like,

it's not that I'm not in, like, I think

it's, oh, it's bad because it's, like, some

misogynistic thing or whatever. Like, she

shouldn't do that because, you know,

this is a, you know, she's equal to me.

She doesn't owe me anything and like that.

But she still wants to do it, so I'm like,

alright, fine.

Um, so she was up at

5 a.m. this morning.

It's for your longer and healthy

life, dummy. No, I know what it's for.

I'm saying that the act of it feels

different, okay? Because it's just different.

But you've got to respect other people's stuff.

And if she believes that that's going to

give me a healthy, longer life and she

wants to do that, then I'm all

for it. Um, but,

uh, it's because she feels bad

you didn't get a dowry. Okay, bro.

I'm completely new to stocks and I'm a,

uh, a student, so I'll be in your care, guys.

Oh, Lord.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

That's, oh, no.

Why would you say fresh meat? This isn't a prison.

Just ban him before it's

too late. I'm pretty sure that's how

cults start. Alright, let me get back

so I can get back to the market. So she woke up

this morning and she goes,

I got up at 5 a.m. and I checked

Robinhood and it lets

me gamble on when the government shutdown

is gonna end.

I'm glad you found it. It's called

prediction markets. It's like

pure gambling. No, no, no, no. You're gonna be

a billionaire in a week. You know why?

Because you're always right.

And since you're always right, prediction markets

are the perfect thing for you.

Right? I want you to do this because we're

gonna be a billionaire because you are always right.

And a prediction market is a,

is a, is a literal cheat code,

financial cheat code for you.

Ask her if she wants my Draft

King referral code. We got her

boys a new attic is born.

You threw away my, my, my

casino chips.

You gave them to the kids and we donated

them to, to fucking Goodwill

because you thought they were toys.

It's not funny.

How is that funny?

Why are you laughing?

She thought that

the black, all the black chips that I had

kept in my little drawer at home

from when I go to play cards were

these funny things that we got

at TwitchCon

because they were the same color.

And so she gave me the kids to play with.

I panicked looking for them.

How are you laughing at

this? I panicked, looked for them, realized

we had taken all of this, put

it in bags and donated it. So

someone for Christmas is gonna

or somebody at Goodwill, if they're

smart enough, is gonna open up their toy and

find 12 black casino chips for the hard

rock. Saki, I'm in South

Florida. I've been to every Goodwill in the

Miami-Dade County since you said that

yesterday. Still no chips. But bro,

it's probably...

If not, you will be sleep with bail.

I sleep with bail by myself every night.

You're not threatening me.

Okay, and Matt's moving. And Matt's

moving. Who will win in five

games, Cubs or Brewers?

Ooh, that's a tough one.

Cubs.

I don't watch baseball anymore, so

I don't know.

I don't know where they're playing.

I don't know what their records are. I don't know

a single player on either team.

I often forget Milwaukee has a thing.

But when you said that, the first thing that

popped in my mind was Cubs. I don't know why.

Oh God, the only stock I

own that's red right now is Chewy. I'm about to hear

about this shit. You wanna know how I

know Chewy's having a good day? Because my wife doesn't ask

me about it. Oh yeah, you're the stock

guy? Okay. I'm a stock

god? Oh God, now here we go.

Oh, here we go.

Now I'm fucked. Because now

she's been taking all my plays,

giving her conviction plays. They've

all fucking done well because everybody's a genius in a

bull market. She tells all her co-workers,

they think she's a stock genius, and now she thinks I'm

good. So now she's gonna ask me, and then she's gonna get

one that's bad, and then I'm never gonna

hear the end of it. Like my chat.

You enjoy a bull market?

You joined a bull market?

We've been in a bull market for 20 fucking years.

What are you talking about? Oh, okay.

Holy Lord

have mercy. NNE is absolutely

going wild. This is crazy.

You're down 75% on VCIG? Oh, I already

cut that shit once. They wouldn't let me buy it anymore. I let it go.

At least you get laid for your

picks? Oh, you think I get laid

from that? Wow, good

fucking pick up on NNE yesterday.

Little bit early on my sells

though, Jesus. Check out

Oklo. We've been in Oklo since it was 20 bucks.

Can't you see he's the man?

Let me hear you applaud. He is more

than a man. He's a shiny golden

god. Yeah, this is where we bought Oklo.

We traded it the first time in November,

traded it here, and then we bought it right here at

1974. Of course, I

sold it when it hit, I think, uh,

60 bucks. I think it was

right here. And then I bought the

chip on NNE. You traded stocks

in 1974?

2024. Thanks for the

zero-day Disney signal, Stocky. I'm up

50%. Ok, first off, there

was not a signal, and second of all,

zero-day is absolutely stupid.

Ok. You know what?

You're gonna make me do something dangerous.

Have you traded open? We actually got

into open when it was under a buck thirty, and

sold when it was seven. And then when it went to ten,

I took puts on it. Alright, you know what you're gonna

make me do? You're gonna make me do something dangerous and stupid.

And I want you to know, because you said that, I'm gonna do something.

I'm gonna do something because of you.

Ok? You're a horrible human being

for making me do this. Because I should

not, I should be more responsible. That's

right. That's right. You

just made me buy

December 260

AMET calls. Alright.

Give a course to learn basics

of stocks for everyone. You want

me to, ok, what the,

first off, that's not my

job. Second of all, I'm not gonna

teach you about how to trade stocks

because let me tell you something. How I trade stocks

is how I trade stocks. If you try to

trade stocks like I do, you will get fucking wrecked.

Ok? Alright? Everyone

has to have their own way of doing it.

And second of all, trading is gambling, right?

Whether it's day trading, whether it's swing trading,

you just lower your risk depending on how much you

put in and how long you're willing to hold and what type of

stock you play. I'm not gonna give a course

on that. That is something you have to do

on your own, ok? I can, I can, you

can learn the basics of it and if you go into my

Discord at the top, it says Stock Market Basics.

There's two GitHub links that send you to all the free information

you need out there. You should be not

in trading. You should be investing, ok?

The market is there for you to grow money, not make

money. Now, if you want to trade, you have your

401k, your IRA, you have your long-term investing,

your DCA, your HSA, you have all that good shit done,

you have mastered all that and you want to gamble a little bit or you

want to predict some things by buying something

or buy individual companies to invest

in or, or remember, there's

a difference between an investment and a trade. You want to do all that,

there's a lot of things you can do. You can paper trade,

you can practice, you can stick around a little bit.

I'm not gonna give a course on that.

There's no, first off, there's no such thing

as a course on how to trade stocks. I could

teach you what things mean. I can

educate you on things, but I can't teach you

how to trade stocks.

I could teach you how to hit a buy button

and a sell button and what, educate

you on what IV means or what,

what bid, you know, ask

bid spread is or what dark pools are.

I can educate you on that. I can't teach you

to do that, ok? That's something

you have to do with your, you know, hands

on, you know what I mean? You have to learn it, ok?

You can't, there's no

teaching you. That's why all these scams out there,

I'll teach you how to trade stocks. No, you can't.

You can educate people or you

can scam people, ok? That's the

only two things you can do.

There's just, there's no in between. Like I

can teach you about

like going, let's say you go to the casino, right?

And you want to play blackjack. I can teach you

the book, right? I can teach you about

the only course you're getting from me

is intercourse.

I'm not angry. No, no, I'm not angry. I'm just like

I'm passionate about this stuff because I see too many

people. Right now, this

is the best time. This is better than

2021 to be a LARPer.

Right now. In the finance

world. If you want

to make money right now,

you don't even use the stock market.

You use

the

idea of the stock market

to screw people over.

Right? I mean, I could

sit here and post all day long my percentage

return on Hut and

even PlugNow and

Hive and Dpro and

SoFi and Palantir and

Chewy. I'm up hundreds of percent

on so many things. I could use that

and just post that and be like, see what I did?

Pay me 200 bucks a month or

give me 500 bucks for a course and I'll teach

you how I did it. And then what?

Then you move on and have to learn it and then

the market changes and the stocks change and the

momentum changes. Now, what do you do? Right?

Shit, I need somebody to tell me what to do now and

then you got to pay for another. You just buy,

man. If it's a good company,

just buy the total market. Don't even fucking work with a company.

If you're going to invest in a company,

then you find out if it's a good company.

Are they a strong company? Do they have a few

future? Is there something that we're moving towards?

But you taught that lesbian girl how to...

Okay, no. What? No.

You taught us how to use the pillow though?

What's your opinion on

Dfly and SoFi?

Well, Dfly we traded recently.

That's a different stock.

SoFi, I still think SoFi is a buy.

I've done many videos on it.

Actually, my new

long-form editor just

clipped out the

part where I broke down where that guy

reached out to me, that well-off guy reached out

to me on Instagram and asked me about stocks and why I gave him

my three stocks. If somebody put a gun to my

head and said, you have $750,000, you have to buy $250,000

of three stocks

for the next five years no matter what

and you can't touch it, what would you buy right now?

And my three stocks were Google,

Oh, and SoFi. And I gave my breakdown on that.

I think SoFi

is

you know, in the short term maybe

valuations change

because value is just based on what people want to pay for.

But I think SoFi is

going to continue and absolutely

disrupt the fuck out of the

finance world. And I think with the BBB

and people, I think people don't understand

what this means.

If you've looked at their chart

and how much

users they've grown by and

that's just another thing.

But I don't think people have understood

what this BBB thing is going to do.

They're cutting

the amount of

student loan borrowing from the federal

federal student loan program

by tens of thousands of dollars

and cutting entire other programs out.

But colleges are not going to get cheaper.

So that means people who are going to college

are going to have to continue to pay more.

And if they can't get it all

from the government, they're going to have to get supplemental

loans from private companies.

And because SoFi has spent

all their goddamn time and money

marketing and acquiring younger users

and getting that name brand recognition

out there, who do you think is going to be

the number one

beneficiary of that?

What's the bear case for SoFi?

That it is digital?

That a lot of these people are going to default

on their loans because they can't pay because

if we hit a recession

or the labor market doesn't do

because the number one

demographic for

increase in unemployment right now

is recent college grads.

Recent college grads almost 9%

of recent college grads are unemployed.

They cannot find a job.

And they can't pay back their student loans.

So they're going to default on those loans.

That could be underwritings that are hit for SoFi.

Number two, SoFi has spent an ungodly amount of money

and continues to do

for user acquisition.

And if there's a slow down

in users that sign up

and assets under management for them

then there's going to be concern from investors

that they're not going to get that long term return

on that because you're spending all this money

and you're not catching that market share.

There's a lot of competitors out there.

And so with tokenization

and with crypto

there's a lot of competition out there.

I always do a bear case for everything that I'm in.

Oh, you weren't ready for that, huh?

See, here's the thing.

You're only used to people that make investments

and that are invested in something

telling you why it's good and why it's going to go up.

Nobody's going to give you their bear case on it.

That's because those motherfuckers

are just doing their thing.

There is nothing I am in that I am not aware

that could have a bear case.

So far, long term,

a buy range.

Here's the thing about any stock.

Do you think the value of the stock is going to be

higher than it is now in 10 years?

Yes? Then buy.

Oh, but what if it goes down? Then buy more.

Like, you don't buy, you don't wait for the dip

to buy something for 10 years from now.

If you think the value of it is going to be

higher than it is in 10 years

then you start buying now.

This is how it is.

This shit of waiting for it.

Do you know how many people in here

or you, you, you

or any of those

I'm not saying they are going to do well for a long time

Do you know how many people in here didn't jump

into Google with us when it went under $80

a couple of years ago?

And then there was a small pullback to $145.

And people were like

well, if it goes under $120, I'm going to buy again.

I'm like, shit, we're up almost 100%.

I'm buying more.

Because I think it's going to be higher in 10 years.

I think Google is the most undervalued of all the MAG7s.

I've been saying that for a year.

Again, it is what it is.

Cost averaging is so important

and reoccurring buy

so that you don't make those decisions.

Let the computer do it for you

because the more you do make your own decisions

the more you get in your own way

the more you fuck it up.

Alright, I got stopped out of Orbs.

Well, half of it stopped out.

Thank you, Bale.

Good boy. Good boy.

You're a good old boy now.

Yeah, good boy.

Shot caller.

Oh God, are you guys still on that shit?

Bro, don't bring that shit in here, man.

I'm not here to fucking discuss that.

I finally went and saw the video that you guys

because you guys kept talking about this

shock thing and this whatever

and I finally went and saw the video

so at least I know what you guys are talking about now

but Jesus, y'all are still on this shit.

We love a witch hunt.

Listen, my kind of thing is

I'm the type of person who

just like with my personal politics

I have personal ideas about things

but unless I have proof of something

I just bite my tongue

because it's like, you know what I mean?

I can understand a lot of the

controversy and stuff like that

but again, that's

I don't think it's about the dog anymore.

I don't think anybody really

cares in this situation.

People who really think

that he did what they say he did

or people who think that it's a lie

the funny thing is it's no longer about the dog.

It's only about

attacking or defending the streamer.

And that's why I don't want to

even mention it

because nobody really gives a shit about the dog.

I'm being honest with you.

I don't have a dog in this fight

no pun intended

but this is not about the dog.

Maybe it was for a few minutes but it's not anymore.

So like, you know what I mean?

It's just the truth.

Thanks for Disney calls.

Make cat food in the payment.

I have no clue what you're talking about.

I had no clue until these guys wouldn't shut up about it yesterday

and then I went and

Guess what?

Your dog got run over by a car.

Anytime I forget I said something, I get reminded.

Also, if I have any mods in here

if you guys could help a

boomer out at some point, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks for the Orbs call.

Fun fact, during the morning call

Orbs was at 10.50

I had gotten it at 10.30 and it immediately

ran 16%. I just didn't sell it.

Holy shit, I sold Disney

weeklies for a tiny loss that would have made my week.

Well, that was the main one that we

looked at this morning. We thought that there was a

really good chance that the park

news was going to make them run because

the last time they announced something like

this, it was huge.

They ended up having a 7%

day. Now, I don't think they're going to have a 7%

day, but this was our

main after open

focus because

they make a shitload of money from their parks

and every time they raise prices, people just keep

going. You need soups,

Eid, or a Shema? Yeah, because

there's no way in fuck I'm making you an admin.

Anyone else looking at Macy's?

No.

Fuck, Disney was the play, huh?

Oh shit, AMAC's moving now.

Can you break down Whirlpool?

You want me to break down

Whirlpool? Texas

or Oklahoma this weekend?

Ooh, that's a tough

one.

I haven't watched college football in a long time

either.

Oh, Oklahoma 100%.

Isn't that Manning kid at Texas now?

I went to Oklahoma.

Well, that explains a lot.

As a Jags fan,

no matter how much I respect the

play and the game of

Peyton Manning, I have to hate him

because of the Colts.

And so,

by that I have to

root against Texas.

But

it feels like this, I don't know

anything about, I don't follow

college football anymore, but I would say

that Oklahoma's going to go in there and

absolutely destroy

Texas because

this is one of those things

where their coach probably tells them

this rivalry's been going on for years.

Texas has this Manning kid

who's like the next one. I want you to

end him. I want you to

make him

I want you to make him

be benched before halftime.

Bench that kid.

I'm talking some fucking

you know, what was the movie?

God, what was that movie again?

Remember the Titans shit.

In another yard.

They are going to bench that kid.

At least that's what the coach is going to tell them.

Bounty gate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Not bounty gate like they're going to hurt him. I mean like

they are going to do like

here's what you do.

Just hear me out, okay?

I'm about to role play again. Not as bad as the one yesterday

with the car salesman.

But you're the Oklahoma coach, okay?

The defensive coordinator.

Your idea is that

this is a statement game.

Everyone expects you to beat them, right?

This is a rivalry game.

And people are like, well, it's rivalry games and shit changes, right?

I mean, I remember in college basketball

because I grew up a Tar Heels fan

and there were divorces over the Tar Heels

North Carolina-Duke rivalry.

It was insane.

It was insane.

And sometimes Duke would be ranked number one

and North Carolina would be unranked

and they would beat them

or have a one point game and vice versa

because rivalry games are pretty intense like that.

We had one in our high school.

I went to a high school in western North Carolina called

We were the only high school in the county, right?

And the next county over

there was

a high school called Pisgah.

Right?

And it was wild because

you know

we had been playing each other every year

for like a hundred years.

And it didn't matter if

one team was 10-1

and one was 1-10 or whatever.

Every time they would play

our stadiums would go from

200 fans to 10,000 people.

They would fill the stands,

they would get people up in the fucking,

they would bring in extra stands

or people sitting up on trucks.

It was insane because it was a rivalry game, right?

And sometimes it would be a very close game

even if the teams were completely mismatched.

So you got to think about it this way, right?

Think about it this way.

Thanks for selling orbs, hee-hee loser.

Hee-hee, half of it got stopped out.

Loser.

I live in Charlotte County, born in

our county high school was the same way.

Yeah, so here you go.

Motherfucker in chat thought he was cooking

but he just learned what a tiered stop loss is.

So back to what I was saying.

So here you go. Oklahoma's defensive coordinator

says they're expecting it to be a close game.

It's going to be a packed stadium.

This kid has all this pressure, he's going to be

as great as the Mannings and stuff like that

and he's kind of shook this year, right?

He's getting a lot of criticism this year.

Why? Because you know

he's got all these expectations.

And he's going to want to show up in this game

and it doesn't matter how bad you start out.

If you fucking have this win against Oklahoma

everyone will forget about your start.

Nobody cares about your start if you beat Oklahoma.

Number six ranked in the country.

You're going to go into Texas

and you go into there.

Arch Manning is home turf, he beats them.

That's what everybody's waiting for. It could happen, right?

No it's not.

The kid's under pressure and he's shook.

So you know what we're going to do?

We're going to play some crazy fucking defenses.

We're going to show blitz and then we're going to back off.

We're going to show zone and we're going to

corner blitzes. We're going to make this kid

fucking regret

this. And he's going to be

frazzled and he's going to make mistakes and he's going to get sacked.

He's going to throw interceptions. And once that happens

and now he's down, he's playing

bad, he knows there's pressure, the fans

are waiting for him like that, he's going to crumble.

He is going to fucking

psych himself out. They're going to have to switch to the run.

And once we stuff the run

and we run up, they're going to have to throw

because it's the only chance to come back and that's when we take him out.

We pick him. Sack him and pick him.

And they're going to bench him.

They're going to do. Okay, my bad.

I almost went too far. And let me tell

you something right now. As a Jaguars fan,

no one knows more about someone

who's supposed to be the next greatest generational

quarterback absolutely fucking letting you down.

Oh shit, I'm up 6% on my AMET

calls already.

I would have done better with Disney, but it's okay.

I'll take one. Alright.

I guess I'm going to sell my last fly call, guys.

We're up 240% on this.

I mean, it doesn't expire until

February, but yeah.

I don't really see a reason to hold it any longer.

I know. This is the buy signal.

Like CRM yesterday. Remember we took CRM

on the dip because they told the hackers,

fuck you, we're not paying you.

And so we took them because of that, even though

most people would think it was a really dumb

reason.

And we nailed the absolute bottom when we bought

those calls. And then it dipped

the next day and then we sold right there and they just kept

going. And then it opened up. I don't even want to look what it was

today. You're up 89%

on BBAI today? I haven't looked at BBAI

today. What was the news?

Is that your wife being pinged on Teams? Yes.

By the way, so

update to our TwitchCon

thing. Alright, so

we talked this morning, before that,

we talked this morning about Delta. Delta

had earnings recently. Now,

airlines, we've talked about airlines before.

Airlines, especially international

airlines, they don't make money

on the actual

tickets, right? Like they

lose money on their economy and stuff like that.

They make, they used to make

all their money from first class and business class,

but now it's like,

basically, in-game purchases.

Their money is

coming from additional purchases.

Okay? And that's why you saw

Southwest Airlines for the first time

actually

start charging for bags.

It used to be always bags fly free. Not anymore.

Not anymore.

They just don't. Okay?

Morgan Freeman's nips.

Good to see you again. And so,

this is, this is not, this is not,

you know, is Fleshlight

up or down? What does that mean?

What does that mean? I mean, I want to answer,

but what the fuck does that even mean? I don't even know how to answer that question.

I don't know what the question is. Honestly,

if you don't have something that's automatic nowadays,

you're just broke. Okay?

Like, who the fuck is still using, you know what I mean?

Alright. So,

airlines are making all of their money

from basically a la carte purchases, right?

Everything that used to be included

is now a charge.

And it's gonna get worse.

Okay? Alright?

It's going to get worse.

You now have to pay for, you know,

literally everything. Whether it's

check baggage, whether it's

the boarding, you know, whatever,

you know, what

group you're in boarding with,

you know, you have to pay for peanuts

and water and fucking

wifi and everything like this. Now the

thing is, is that instead,

here's where they're making their money, right? So they didn't

make any money. So they didn't make

any money. Let me just show you the genius

of this. I know it's fucked up, but this is the genius.

You're like, how are airlines making money, right?

How do they make money? It doesn't make any sense, right? Because it's so

they're giving tickets away for dirt cheap.

Well, that's the way you do it. Think of it

like video games, okay?

There used to be a time when there was no such thing as a

free video game, right? Why would there be a free video game,

right? Nobody makes any money

off of that. All that work to build a video game,

you don't make any money off of it, right?

Consoles and stuff like that. Same thing with airlines, right?

They were losing money because they

only made money on their first class of business

class. And if they didn't have

that, then it was just about volume of traffic.

Well, now they've figured

out how to do IRL microtransactions.

Okay? So,

here's what they decided to do.

They don't want to add more business in

first class, right? Because those are big

seats with TVs and stuff like that.

And these are usually 3x to

5x the

cost of economy, right?

So, you have your economy seats back here

and let's say that it cost you

$250.

Well, that's going to cost you $1,000.

And it worked out.

Because you're 4x-ing what

you're getting here, but you're only losing

3 seats worth of

space. And if it's

first class, you're talking about 10x, right?

So, that's how they kind of made their money.

Not anymore. Here's what

they did. How do we

continue to make money here, but make

even money back here? Well, we're going to start

check bags, right?

That's number one.

Number two, boarding

order, okay?

Picking seats,

okay? Fucking beverages

and snacks, okay?

Lounges.

After COVID, they had so many people in the

lounges, they had to start cutting them. And the list

goes on and on and on.

By the way, guys,

you didn't notice this,

but over the past five years,

they have decreased

the size, slowly,

of what is acceptable as a carry-on.

You've lost about two inches

here, about one inch here, and about

a half an inch in depth.

You didn't notice that, did you?

Nah, they didn't tell you that. They didn't tell you

all about that, right? Yeah, so

um, so yeah, you've got that.

I could go on and on and on and

on and on. My wife's

watching and heard you and said she has the same

problem, or she's dealing with the same problem.

What?

Okay, regardless, let's keep going.

Alright, is she talking

about from her ex to you or something? Okay,

moving on. So, I've

done videos on this before, on how they've got

bounty programs now for

agents to find out if

your carry-on is too big or not, and they get like five, ten

twenty bucks if they make you check it and whatever.

Increase the price there. Prices are going

up everywhere. But now they've developed

something else. They said, we got an idea.

How about this?

How about instead of adding more

first class and

business class, what if

we just take the same

fucking seats, right?

And if we're getting

250 bucks a pop

for these seats, what

if we took one row out,

right? Minus 750

dollars, and put

all of these seats three inches further back.

And charge a hundred dollars

more for it. So let's just

take minus three

seats, 750 dollars,

and then add

three inches to fifteen seats.

Think about that. We'll call it

Economy Plus.

That's a, that's no way that's

gonna work, Stocky. Why would somebody

pay an extra hundred bucks for three additional

inches? Babe, just be

quiet, okay? So,

alright? That's what

they did. And you might say, this

isn't gonna do anything.

Well, you're wrong. Emerald

Queen goes, I would. So,

this is what we found out.

Delta had their earnings

yesterday, right?

I gotta remember to not just put the ticker for people who don't

trade stocks. Delta had their earnings.

That's the bell dress I got

her. Now,

they had their earnings. And that three

extra inches is bringing in

billions. Grow the fuck

up, Jay. Just grow up. Their

premium seating is now closing

in on their general main cabin seating.

Okay?

From Q3 2022

to Q3 2025,

it has been, the

gap has been closing. Q3

of 2025, their main

cabin brought in

6.1 billion dollars.

Premium?

5.9 billion.

But here's the crazy thing

about it all. They tracked

everything. They have noticed

that almost

every single person

who booked a

basic economy

and did the upgrade to economy plus

never went back.

Apparently, once you get that

extra three inches, you never

settle for less. They mean an extra

few inches are always good. Shut the fuck, get the fuck out of here.

You've been waiting five minutes to say that.

Oh, it's way bigger than I

thought. Your wife said you were packing.

What's she talking about? Don't worry.

Don't worry about it.

She's turning into a streamer, alright?

Alright, moving on. Listen.

Yeah, the only thing I'm packing is for this fucking trip.

Now, this is...

I don't understand

your stream. This guy's actually teaching

us and talking about stocks and some interesting

things, but he's making it fucking weird. Yeah,

that's how you learn. You weren't gonna

learn about this now, but now anytime somebody says

three inches, you're gonna think of two different things now.

Okay? Alright?

Now, here's the thing.

Nobody's going back.

And the CEO said within

a few quarters, premium seats are gonna

overtake revenue

of their main cabin.

That means they're gonna end up taking out

another row and putting in

you know, five, you know, putting all

the seats back three inches again.

This is the new hack. Then eventually

you get rid of all the regular seats and premium

becomes a new basic. And ladies

and gentlemen, you just learned how inflation,

well, sorry, shrinkflation

happens. Okay?

It's like the frog in the

boiling water thing, right? Like, put him in there

when it's hot, it jumps out, you put it in slowly.

You see what I mean? Like, that's what's gonna happen.

Now, you guys remember those

seats that we saw? There's two seats

that they're, there's one that they're doing, it's the stadium

seats, right?

That look like this, so they can

fit more. And then they're even

thinking about doing the, for short flights,

the standing only, where it like,

it looks like this, where you're basically

doing the, doing the

standing, and they can, they can

put those, a shitload of those.

Well, this is true, we've covered

these. They wanna pack you

in.

There's always gonna be people like me who just

don't give a shit. So,

we just, I mean, my wife and I booked Basic

Economy, and they're like, are you sure

you want this? I'm like, yeah. They're like,

just so you know, you don't get to

choose your seats, and you may not sit

together. I'm like, that's the fucking point.

Um, also,

you're gonna be last to board,

okay? I'm not in any

rush to fucking sit on the plane.

Why am I in a rush to sit on the plane?

I'd rather sit out here, where I

can go to the bathroom, I can spread my legs,

and I can, or, you know, stretch out my legs,

I can do whatever I want. I'm not in any

rush to get on the plane.

I have a fucking backpack. I'll just throw it in there, if there's

no room, I'll fucking put it under the thing.

Alright? Fun fact,

you know, my wife's checking a bag anyway, so

if we get to the, we get to the, uh, on the thing,

and they say, we're in a room, we'll check it for you for free,

well, fuck it, I gotta do check bags anyways, because my

wife, so, fuck it, fine, I don't

care, I'll just take out what I need and just do that. I'm not in any

hurry. You know what I mean?

You didn't spread your legs when you were in the wheelchair?

Yeah, but, that, that was,

yeah, I'm sorry, that, that, you know,

sometimes I have to, I have a hard time walking

when the pain gets too bad. Granted,

I didn't need it for every flight,

but it did get us through customs quicker.

Um, I'm talking about

short flights. Listen,

when we went, when I go to Europe,

I, I, I go business class.

I don't book business class, but I

fly business class, and I save a lot of money doing it.

My wife got to do it for

the first time, and I fucked up, because

I thought, wow, she's never done this, she's really enjoying

herself, and then all she learned from it is

when we send her parents back to India,

we are booking them business

class from here to India.

I explained to her it's expensive, and she

said, then make more money. And you're

wondering why my streams have been longer lately.

Poor China man? Nah, fuck that guy.

Okay? Maybe he should have fucking

been smarter with his investments and had more retirement

that he could spend, okay? Alright?

He had a cane, I don't give a shit, okay?

I had more money. I'm talking about

the hack I taught you guys about the business class.

It's not always gonna work, but it, it, it,

you're not losing anything, and if you do get it,

I mean, every single time I have flown

across, uh, internationally, except

one time, it's worked for me, and I've saved tens

of thousands of dollars, and still flown business class

each time. I mean, fuck, the only

reason we didn't do it on the way there was because it was an empty

flight, and, uh, the guy was really nice, he,

oh, I'm supposed to reach out to him, uh, and he,

and he, we talked about podcasting and stuff like

that, and, and he booked us our own roads, so we had our

own, like, sleep, you know, whole roads

so we didn't need to book it, but otherwise it was fine.

Must be nice. Must be

nice. Last example,

it didn't sound like you saved much, wasn't it still like

$800 more? Sir,

if I book

business class

from Miami to

Amsterdam, it is

generally $3,600

to $5,000.

If I book an economy,

it's generally

about $800,

and if I do my trick, it costs

me about $750 to $800

more. That's $1,600.

That's less than half

to one-third of what

it would have cost me to book it directly.

Yeah, but you get a guarantee. I don't, I'm

not looking for a guarantee. I'm

planning on flying economy.

I'm not gonna book a $5,000

ticket. There's no way in hell.

But if I can get this for

that, why not? I give it

a shot, and every time except once it has worked.

I'm not turning tricks for upgrades.

Fun fact, the first time

I did it, it was almost an accident.

And it's all because of that

newly married couple from Ecuador

or whatever. That's the only

reason that I, like, I used

this trick, and it worked

perfectly, and I knew,

it's something I had known about, but I'd never really

tried it out until I did that, and it was my

first trip to, it was like six, five years ago

to TwitchCon, and I was like,

I was like, you know what, I'm gonna do it. And it worked.

No, not turning tricks.

No, you don't turn tricks.

Scam? Ecuadorian couples? No!

You guys, I even, I even have the picture

from when I, when I documented that whole

ordeal in Amsterdam after COVID

during the heatwave when they, like, were backed up and we

had to, like, I spent five hours in line

and they had to, like, go through the airport, then outside

for two hours, and then back in, and

then right at the end, I saw Annie Fuchsia get put under

the fucking, uh, they let her

under the pylons, like, right in the front

of the line. I'm like, I've been, and then

she got caught, and I caught her, and so, like,

then the guy was like, oh shit, I gotta help both of them,

and then we got to it. It was the only reason I made my flight.

But I sat, I went to my seat, and I had a window seat,

and there was this young couple,

and they were looking out the window

or whatever, and I speak enough Spanish

that, uh, I was, I was, like, I was letting them

sit by the window, and they're like, oh, lo siento, lo siento,

you know, and I said, um,

and they moved over, and I was sitting there,

and the girl looked over and, and,

and I just basically asked them, I was like,

you know, are you guys heading home? And I said, you know,

I asked them where, I said, donde es tu casa?

You know, like, where's your house? Not like, where's your home,

but like, where, where do you live? And

they're like, Ecuador, and then they said that they had just gotten

married, and they were here for a honeymoon.

And they didn't look like they'd come from a lot

of money, so I'm assuming this was a big trip

for them into Europe. And

I could see how, like,

I could just see how, like, excite, like,

how much she was looking out the window, and how, like, this was a big,

this was, like, the last leg back before they had to go home.

And I was like, fuck, man, I was like,

god damn it. It's like,

you guys want to sit by the window? And she just all lit up,

and I was like, alright, you can sit by the window. So I'm sitting in the aisle,

and I'm just sitting there, and we're about to take off,

and so I looked at the head, um,

Dutch, like,

you know, the Dutch lady, the older lady,

like, you know, blonde hair, but really tall,

and she's, like, walking through

very strong, and I said, excuse me, she goes,

what do you want? I was like,

do you have anything

available in the front?

Let me see. I have

one. I was like, uh,

how much would it, how much would it, you know,

how much would it cost to upgrade?

Tis 550 euros.

Um, can I,

can I go ahead and do that? You wait!

I'm like, what, what? You wait!

I'm like, what am I waiting for? I must

speak with the other

flight attendants. So she goes,

I'm like, Jesus fucking

Christ, like, what's going on? She comes back,

you can have it.

Oh, for upgrade? Oh, no.

For 550 euros.

I'm like, okay.

So she hands me this, like, iPad,

and, like, I'm shaking as I put my credit card.

She's looking at me,

and then looks down at me, and looks back up

again, like it's not gonna work, and it goes,

and then she goes, you're in seat

2E, enjoy your flight.

Okay.

Like, chill.

That's cool. We're cool, lady.

It's all good. Like, I got

the money. Like, I'm good. I wasn't,

you know, I wasn't trying to get anything free out of you.

She was French?

No. But I

still have the thing they gave me.

If you fly on the Dutch airline, at the end

they give you this little house filled with booze,

and you have to collect

the whole city, but I didn't do it, and I don't drink,

so I kept it. I have it here.

Somewhere. Unless my wife gave

it to the kids to play with, and we donated it.

Oh, it's funny now, isn't it?

Fucking gave my money away.

Why do I have money and chips and real money?

Number one, because you couldn't

spend it, number one. Number two,

anytime I get to, unfortunately for

you, when I go and play cards, a lot of times

I leave with money. I just don't wanna,

I don't wanna spend time at the,

why are you in your fucking bra and

panties just putting on lotion looking at me?

Like, you're doing that shit on purpose.

You do this every day? And you smack your

ass like that too? You're coating

your ass with what? With lotion.

It's called skin care?

What do you call it when I coat your ass with something

else?

That's the best natural skin care? Really?

Because you were crying about your dress yesterday.

Okay. I'm sorry, we were still

streaming. So,

but the worst, that wasn't the worst one.

The worst was when I, because usually now I use the

trick before I get on it, because remember, you have to do it

an hour before boarding is when they

close the front gate in ticket sales.

That's when you do it. And

so, I usually pay for it.

Then, I paid for it

and I was wearing my, you know, my camo

pants and my like

shoes with holes in them and like some fucking

shirt and a hat and looking like this and I sit there

and as soon as I get in there,

I go in and the lady goes,

right this way sir? I said, no, no, I'm in

business class. She goes, excuse me?

I go, yeah, I'm actually to the right

not to the left. Can I

see your ticket? This was an American. She goes, can I see your ticket?

And I go, yeah, it's right here. She goes,

right this way. I sit down.

Two more times, someone

came by and asked me to see my

ticket. What is this? Is this a fucking

James Bond movie?

Next time take a shower? Listen

here you little shit. Okay, that

wasn't, it wasn't, I was showered.

It's just I don't dress like the people

that go there because a lot of people want to impress.

I'm in business class. People have to see me. I'm like,

whatever man, like I'm just, I wear comfortable

clothes. Have you ever thought about getting

laid on the airport? I actually

um, when we were in

different seats on the way to Europe, it was

an empty flight and I

kept looking over there and she was all, because she

just loves airports and air and she's just sitting there with all

comfy little blanket on just watching

something on her phone and

and so I'm like trying to get

her attention because it's like

it's, it's, it's um,

I'm so bad for this.

So she's on the other, the other

line of seats for me and she's

sitting against the window and I'm on this line of seats and it's

dark and everyone's asleep and

so I'm trying to get her attention but she's like watching a movie

and eating her little food and

so I have to think fast. So I

I have that little feature on your phone where I draw

and then I turn it so she has to see

it in the dark and she looks over and she has to see it

each time and so this is what

happened. This was the first picture.

I know I'm a child

for this but I don't care. Whoops.

You had a dream, we had a romantic

flight. Like yeah, there's no such thing as a romantic

flight. So obviously this was the

first one I went, I went and it made

her laugh. Then I drew

this one. It was a picture of

her riding me on the seat

by the window. Then there was

this one.

Then this one.

I was not

sexually harassing you on the flight.

Then of course there was

this one. And then when she

then when she said no

I drew me crying

by myself. So yeah

so as my wife is

trying to enjoy her movie as she keeps looking over

and I did try. I did try.

It did not work. Oh! Oh

shit! What happened? Here we are.

Lord have mercy. What just happened?

Spy dying and stock guy

is sharing blow job stick figures.

What was the 11am?

Trump was set to meet Xi

in two weeks but now seems no

reason to. Chinese

letters were especially inappropriate.

Trump calculating increased

tariffs on Chinese products. China

becoming very hostile.

Uh oh lord lord. Boys there it is.

Elation for the day.

Uh. Trump threatens

massive tariff increase on Chinese imports through

response to proposed

export controls on rare earth.

Trump says uh China

made a sinister move with rare earth

controls. Alright well

this can only mean one thing.

Time to play Amazon again bitches.

Do I have any day trades left?

Or am I about to go fucking powder day trader because of Amazon?

It worked yesterday.

Wait you're not going to let me buy shit?

Really? Is Robinhood down or

is it just me? Dude they're down

again? That's alright.

I'm picking up the same Amazon calls.

I got them yesterday at 97

and sold them for 150.

I'm going to do it again.

This should be. We'll see. If this recovers

back. If SPY recovers

back in um

the next

like if it bottoms out in the next

10 minutes then I'll

play the dip here. Otherwise I'll just wait a little bit.

My NVX is still up 30%.

NNE is still up 3%.

MO just went up to 1%.

UUU is still really green.

Couple things holding on for dear life

right now. We'll see how it plays out.

Pepsi is up 3% for me.

Oh shit I took my um I sold my

Pepsi calls through um

after that I took through earnings yesterday. They actually did pretty well.

Alright let's wait for this to bottom out

a little bit. I'm not saying

that everything is going to go right back up but

this market has shown that no matter what

the news is it just

always gets bought up because

everyone is afraid someone else is going to buy up.

I'm not saying we're going to end green today but

this is going to get bought up. I don't know.

I mean it does feel like we're going to see one of these right here.

Right where it's like.

You know. And then who knows

what happens the rest of the day.

But it feels like we're going to see one of those movements right there.

Uh no no not this exact movement.

I'm just saying like this general like

this general like direction.

Why'd spy drop so hard?

Trump going uh Trump and uh and she

fighting again. How the fuck

did you know NVX was going to go up so much?

I did. The whole reason that

I was. I went into NVX was because of

the DOE thing and and and uh

Alright I'm going to play orbs one more time here.

Fuck my AMET calls were doing good too.

670 calls got it.

Thanks for the drawing I'm going to make rent. No no no no no no no

no no no no no no no no no no no

that's not what I said. By the way we are now up

300%

on our remaining U U U

shares. Some of you guys are up even more because you never

like bought and sold bought and sold. But what

a fucking play. Uranium and nuclear

and and all this stuff from last year

and a bunch of it's just really good timing.

What did you get your uh Amazon calls at? Uh

88 a piece just a minute ago.

Um this is dangerous.

But we shall see what happens.

Okay. Alright let's run

marbles real quick so everybody can kind of get their breath.

And uh everybody's going to

come in asking what happened to SPY what happened to SPY

what happened to SPY what happened to SPY. I don't have to answer that a hundred times because we'll be

doing marbles. And then we're going to come back to this

uh see what uh what the updates are

from whatever Trump's saying and then I have

to go over the Ro Khanna thing on Monday

with you guys and then we have to um

uh we have to uh

what is this?

Okay. Chat Stocki if you were

soup okay and

and eat it and then shit out. Whatever fucking

letters come up in the toilet or whatever or

you know what alphabet soup and then just like stir

it up and then the first four letters or three letters

come together you buy that stock. Okay.

You don't put a stop loss on it

you only sell it for 100% or 0%.

You don't sell it before. It either goes to

0 or goes to 100. That's it.

Okay. Or you go to

one of these right here.

when I've had a shit and max has gone through

the roof. My man. That's what I'm talking about. You belong

here first time chatter. You come

to this stream and let my man

my quant give you a signal and just

full port it and sell at the top

then do it again. That or just DCA

and buy vu. This man ain't a

cuck. A beta. A sigma. But

an alpha. Okay that was. Listen bro

I really didn't. Why are we buying

max? Wait a second.

Why are you

asking questions?

Why are you buying max? Because you're not a bitch.

Are you a bitch?

Are you a beta bitch?

Okay. Alright.

Grow some fucking balls. Ladies grow some fucking

ovaries. Don't do that.

Alright. Alright.

Let me tell you something right now.

Alright. All those people who doubted you

and said you weren't good enough

and treated you inferior.

Fuck them. They're not in max.

It's called max and it's called

what's it called? Media

alpha. Media alpha.

We're on a live stream.

That's media. We're alphas.

To the max.

How much margin? All of it.

Are you a bitch? No?

Then you go full fucking throttle.

Do you have anything left in your home

equity for HELOC? Fucking take it out.

Your kids have a 529?

Not anymore. Do you have a

401k? Nope. A 401

max you do. Okay.

Have you donated blood

this week? No? There you go.

That's two more shares. Alright.

Do you own plates?

Fucking sell them.

You rent? Well guess what?

You're subleasing your fucking

ass because you're gonna make some money.

Alright? I'm sorry.

I'm blacking out here.

Your kids don't have a 529.

Okay? They have a 529

max. You've heard of a

737 max? That shit crashes.

A 529 max only

goes up. Is this what

finfluencers who pump stocks sound like?

No. I'm not

serious. I bought one fucking

share. This is a joke.

How do I sign up to sublease my ass?

Only I'm just resubbed for 60

months. I'm dying over

here right now. You're dying over here?

Then start a GoFundMe.

But don't use the money for your health.

Use it to buy more max.

Do you have a life insurance policy?

Yes. Are you dying? Yes.

Fucking borrow against

it. Or if you die, tell your family to use the money

to buy more max, man. What are you talking

about? Okay?

Is your wife hot? No? Well, fuck it.

Maybe tell her to get another job. Is she?

Yeah. There you go. Another stream of revenue.

Fucking make some money.

Alright? There's a lot of things

you can do right now. Okay?

Airbnb your neighbor's

house out. Don't tell them about it.

Get it for a 30-day rental.

Somebody pays for it. Pays you up

front. You do that shit.

Close out your fucking account

because when they show up at your neighbor's house,

you know, what are you

gonna do? Right?

And then, what you're gonna do is, is you're

gonna see the fight. See what's going on. Tell them,

oh my god, that happened to you. That's unfortunate.

Did you find another place? Oh, you don't?

Listen, I got an extra room in my place.

I can rent it out to you for a couple days while you get this squared

away. Fucking double up the revenue.

And what are you gonna do with that money? You're gonna put it in max.

And then you're gonna get locked up

in max. But it's cool because

when you get out of max, your max position's

gonna be up so much that you didn't paper

hand bitch it. The only way to stop you from paper

handing this fucking stock is to go to prison.

You're doing yourself a favor because when you

come out, your money's gonna be up so goddamn much

that you would, guess what? You didn't have to work.

You didn't have to pay bills.

Alright? You save all that time, stress,

and money, and when you get out, you have a fucking nest egg

because max. Fuck,

they made a movie called Max, I think.

You've heard of Max Payne? Well, this is

max fucking gain, baby.

This is getting kind of weird. I'm, I'm...

Look at this. I'm, listen.

The market may be

red. Okay?

But only beta bitches are red right now.

Why? Because guess what's green?

That's right. Mother

fucking max.

Oh shit, I didn't buy it.

That's because you're a pussy.

Thanks for the, thanks for sitting on the

sidelines. Okay?

It's like when you go to a football game and you dress in a

jersey. Oh, I'm part of the team. You ain't part of the team.

You're paying the team.

They laugh at you. Hey, thanks for

the money. You spent 15

bucks for a hot dog, 12 dollars for a beer.

You ain't max.

I'm sorry, I'm really, I'm

really blacking out right now.

Can you do this every time a new person asks

what to do, how to get started trading? No,

no, no. I'm, I'm... Look at

NVX flying. It's a tourniquet W.

It is. I'm, I'm sure he's up pretty big

since his position. I bet he wishes he

bought when we did. Speaking of

which, um,

my graphite barons.

For my fellow graphite barons.

This is where we re-entered, too,

the other day. It has taken a

while. Thank you again to

hamsolo.

If a stock at this point in time is

98% down during this bull run, it ain't

the play. Just being honest, chat can

glaze all day. I don't

care. See, you can't see the future,

right? Past is not the future.

You were focusing on

what they were, not what they would become.

400% now.

It's funny, I had, at one point,

I was, like, a thousand shares

deep on this, and now I'm only 400 shares deep on it.

That's alright.

Fridays really are the most productive streams.

Oh, shit, I'm gonna forget and

Sarah's gonna be mad at me again.

Sarah's always mad at me.

Wait, are we making money on our Helen of Troy calls?

Oh, we are.

Your wife, I remember from the mall

in India, Stocky. I don't know what that means.

I live in India, by the way.

You and 1.8 billion

other people. The fuck you talking about, little

bro? Can they buy Macs in

India? Yes. Are you in it?

No? Hey, Stocky,

I don't live in India, by the way. Thanks, man.

What happened to that guy in chat

that bought the NVX calls? I don't know.

I am also not from India? Okay, thank you.

Kind of crazy that some of these things

that we sat on for a while fucking went nuts.

I missed the top on it, though. I did get

stopped out of some shares. Thank you for the person who said something.

I got stopped out of 345.

That's gonna be the new

thing here on stream.

Are you Macs? Are you not

Macs enough? Are you Macs enough?

Okay, okay. Marbles,

then we gotta do Colin Zillow's React Andy

shit because I have to go pick up my kids

from the school so that we can

take them to the dentist today.

I was supposed to do

a meeting with some people

at Twitch about our panel

at TwitchCon. They asked me to

they literally said, hey,

can you do a panel

on ads and

monetization? I'm like, why would you ask me

to do it, right? There's so many other streamers. Then I

realized it's because I'm the only other streamer who

talks about ads, not good or bad,

but just how it works for users and for

whatever, and they need somebody to do something positive.

They said, we're gonna do a meeting

on Friday. I said, okay. And what time?

They told me what time it was, and I said, okay.

Alright. I said, I can't really get during that

time because I gotta pick up my daughter. They said,

oh, well, unfortunately we can't move

it around because there's a lot of other

people that are on this meeting as well, and we

don't want to inconvenience them. And I said, that's totally fine.

I'm not, you know, whatever.

I can't make it, unfortunately, and so you can give me

a synopsis or whatever. So I didn't

know who, I had no idea who was gonna be on the panel,

right? So I looked, and I see

who I'm on the panel with. And two

of them are Twitch staff, and one is a

like a really small streamer.

And I was like, that's good because

it's kind of like, that's what you want for a panel.

But I was like, why am I,

why was I asked? Am I the only person who would accept

doing this? Like, I don't know.

Kind of strange.

I thought it was gonna be like with other, other, other like,

not that I'm like some big shot, I'm not even

close, but like other sizable streamers that could

like talk about ads at a scale.

But, I'm totally cool

with it. I'm always, I'm always that

person who, if somebody's like, hey,

uh, can you share your opinion or

knowledge or, you know, whatever on something,

um, that you might know about? I'm like,

yeah, fuck it, why not? That's cause

you're Max. Will I discuss Max at

TwitchCon? Why would I want

people who aren't ready for that?

Not everyone's ready for Max.

Okay? Sometimes you

gotta work your way up, right?

It's like anal training. Gotta work

the plug, something. Let's just do marbles.

Alright, non-profit, congrats on the

win earlier. Alright, let's do an old throwback.

No, that's too long of a map. So we're

buying more plug? Wait, no, what?

Thanks for subbing after I just said that.

Thanks for subbing after I just said that.

Alright, get in, get in, get in, get in,

I just wanna play, go, go, go, we got so much shit to go over with.

Go over, not go over with.

I love how I'm saying that right

as I'm looking at an email from

a representative of Congress that's

coming on the show on Monday. Why is

spy falling, falling so much? Well, because everybody

is, is, is, is on edge

right now, and if the, if Trump is threatening

more, um, more

tariffs, then obviously people are like, oh shit,

here we go again, let me take some profit just to see

until the next time he, uh, he,

uh, he, uh, you know, either backs off

of it or does anything like that.

Alright, get in guys, we got a lot to do, let's hurry up.

I'm blaming you. Alright, let's go.

Hurry up. One month of gains

gone in five minutes? What the fuck

were you in, little bro?

I got NVX carrying my whole portfolio.

MO's going nuts right now, by the way.

Big rotation of divvies.

Well, except for Verizon.

Alright, let's run it, guys.

Let's go NVX, man, fucking carrying.

You just never know, man, you just never know.

Damn, I went from up one percent to down

two and a half percent. That was fucking crazy.

Is this really what you listen to? No,

I do this on purpose. Here, you want me to

make a wor- get a worse one for you?

Alright, here you go. I'll find an even worse

one for you, just cause you ruined it.

You ruined the moment, so now I have to make a- I have to find an even worse

song. Here you go.

...

...

Holy shit, NVX. What a fucking

day. Never knew being

a graphite baron would carry my portfolio.

Alright, Divvy's looking good right now.

UU's still going.

I'm gonna buy a few more Poet shares.

I've been buying ten shares, like, every, uh,

75 cents down.

Did you get my hair cut?

I mean, yeah.

Can't get it cut too many more times.

Can you pick me up on my Po- I told you guys when I did my

whiteboard, Poet is not gonna be, like, open door.

There's not as many people. Taking options

is stupid. You're gonna overpay for it, and this thing

is in a cycle right now. It's in a down cycle.

If it gets picked up over the next week,

it'll have a run, but you're not gonna see-

it's not gonna play out probably the way that, uh,

that, um, um,

that Open Door did, because

it's too diluted with buyers.

Chinese graphite supply- graphite supply

is the biggest threat for NVX, I would think.

And that's why all of the

yesterday's curb restrictions on

Chinese precious metal exports and imports

to the United States was good for them.

What's my average on Poet? Oh, fuck, I don't

know. Let me see. My average on Poet

is, uh,

849. VCI bag holders

are- oh, I'm done with VCIG. I had to

sell it for, uh, uh, for this time

for a loss, because, uh, they wouldn't let me buy it anymore

on TOS, and so the only reason I was in

VCIG is I was up and down trading it,

but because I couldn't buy anymore, I just let the position

go. Alright, um,

I killed my fuckin' AMAC call.

That's why I took December, though.

I'll buy one more here.

Chai or Poet long term? Neither one. Why would

you- those are two of the- neither

of those make any sense.

Did I read Trump's ranty truth post-

uh, truth social post net? No.

Can you send it to me?

Oh my god, the market- the market's-

the market's crashing! It's over! Oh my god,

we're at the same place we were

ten days ago! Remember this

one? The market's crashing. It's over.

Market's crashing, it's over.

Buy every dip, guys. I'm just

saying. As a matter of fact, let me buy

some more VU today, because I buy every 1%

down. Uh, 1% intraday down. I get

1.5% today. Mizzed?

Is that two? Okay. Learn

from Mizz gift? Yeah, okay. Alright, let's see

what we got.

Uh, do do do do do do do

do do do do do.

What the fuck is this stock that I own? I don't even

know what this stock is. What is this?

What is this? What is BNBX?

Is that something I own that got

the name changed? What the fuck is

BNKK? Oh, that's Safety Shot. Okay,

they changed their name. Oh, they're going for

30 cents, so I'm gonna buy a couple more of that. Hold on.

Okay. Nevermind, you can't buy it anymore.

Okay, uh, yeah.

Alright, so I'm just gonna buy VU. That's it.

If it goes further down, I might buy some, uh, VUG.

Okay.

BNBX was APDN? Oh, I got some of those left

over when we went 1,000% on it. I kept

like 100 shares to see what would happen.

I was wondering what that was.

Stocky, hold my hand. Oh my god, we're down 1.6%.

Lord, it's over.

It's over. Please. Please, somebody.

Max is green. Help us.

It's game over.

Any reason for the sudden dip? Yeah, Trump and she

are fighting again. Somehow my

fly is still doing... Run for the hills?

Just breathe.

Wait it out. Wait it out. It's okay.

Breathe.

Breathe. I'm down

3% of my poet calls because you're an idiot for taking

calls. Sell everything, liquidate. Oh, here

we go. Breathe.

Breathe.

You got this. I believe in you.

Breathe.

Let me see this. Are you in Cypher? Not

anymore, no. Some very strange things

are happening in China. They are becoming

very hostile and sending letters to countries throughout the

world that they want to impose export controls

on each and every element of production having to do with rare earths

and virtually anything else they can think of,

even if it's not manufactured in China.

Nobody has ever seen anything like it

but essentially it would clog the markets

and make life very difficult for virtually every

country in the world, especially for China.

We have been contacted by other countries

who are extremely angry at this great

trade hostility which came out of nowhere.

Our relationship with China over the past six months

has been a very good one, thereby making this move on

trade an even more surprising one.

I have always felt that they've been

lying in wait and now, as usual, I have

been proven right, because I'm always right.

There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world

captive, but that seems

to have been their plan for quite some time.

Starting with the magnets and other elements

that they have quietly amassed into somewhat

of a monopoly position, a rather sinister

and hostile move to say the least.

But the US has monopoly positions

also, much stronger and more far reaching

than China's. I have just not

chosen to use them. There was never a reason for me

to do so until now.

The letter they sent is many pages long

and details with great

specificity each and every

element that they want to withhold from other nations.

Things that are routine

are no longer routine at all. I have not spoken to

President Xi because there was no reason to do so.

That was a real surprise, not only to me

but to all the leaders of the free world.

I was to meet with President Xi in two weeks at

APEC in South Korea, but now there seems to be

no reason to do so. The Chinese letters

were especially inappropriate in that

this was the day that, after 3,000

years of bedlam and fighting, there was

peace in the Middle East. I wonder

if that timing was coincidental.

Depending on what China says about the hostile

order that they have just put in, I will be

forced, as President of the United States of America, to financially

counter their move. For every element

that they have been able to monopolize,

we have two. I never thought it would come

to this, but perhaps, as with all things,

the time has come. Ultimately,

though potentially painful, it will be

a very good thing in the end for the USA.

One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment

is a massive increase on tariffs on Chinese products

coming to the United States of America. There are many other

countermeasures that are likewise

under serious consideration. Thank you for your attention

to this matter. No, he did not write

this. Well, it's what I opened

up the morning call with, which

was, Trump took an L2

today. He did not win the Nobel

Peace Prize. Therefore, there

was going to be something that he had to do.

And here we are. Let's keep an eye on VIX

here. 28%.

Pretty big spike here. Just like the one at the beginning of

August. Very similar.

But, unless something

is announced, it's going to do one of

same fucking

same fucking thing. So we'll see. So I

guess buy the dip, right?

How many SPY shares do you have right now?

I don't own SPY. I own VU.

This is how the bear market starts. Oh, here we go again.

Oh my god.

We just read it.

Trump and she are fighting.

Should I buy the dip now or in a week?

Well, why don't you just leg into things?

It doesn't have to be all or nothing.

I have a thing where if the S&P 500

falls more than 1% intraday, I buy

one or two shares of my

VU. Isn't VU the

same as SPY? Yeah, so buy SPY.

See you in 30 years. Tell me what you learned.

Stockpile canned food and water.

Oh god. That's the

MIS strat? Okay. We're not going to any

bunkers. Buy toilet paper

not VU? Oh, come on. Don't do that

shit. I'm at my local Walmart

all the shelves are

bare now? No, they're not.

Refineries have run out of silver and gold?

No, they're not. The ships are gone?

No, they're not. The ports

are empty? No, don't start that shit again.

Stock market prime day? Okay.

Thank god I bought some large

stock of toilet paper last week? No.

Stocking up ammo? No. Are the

cheese caves empty? Never. The cheese caves

only get more full every day.

Aristotle just said to sell everything? Oh god.

These are the days where

not him specifically, because I

don't know what he does, but

the stock

furus out there and the signal

services and the course sellers

they tell all their people, buy this, buy

this, and then something like this happens

and everyone gets wiped out and their answer

is, well, shouldn't

you know, it happens guys, or you know

what, that's why you can't, that's why you can't

put more money in than you're willing

to lose. It's trading, man. It's part of the game.

You're going to take losses, man. I mean, they can't,

you know, whatever, man. It's just, you know,

they somehow gaslight you.

If you get wiped out

by a 1.5%

drop in the S&P 500,

you legitimately are a

little over leveraged.

Just a little bit. Just a

little bit. You might be a little bit

over leveraged or a little bit short dated

or a little bit risk on.

For example, what did I say?

If something happens this week,

right, whether it's the Feds or anything

like that, and we have a dip,

unless it's like a really big dip

and it continues, we'll probably see a rotation

in the divvies. And what do I do when I

get runs on my, I'm not saying I'm good at this,

but what do I always tell you guys that I do

whenever I have a big run on

spec and growth stocks and I profit take?

Buy the dip, sell the rips, right?

I take the profit and just buy the dip on

my dividend stocks. And when we get that rotation

in, it helps balance me out. So if you

look at the market right now,

MO, AbbVie, Walmart,

VTR, they're green.

Money's moving in. So

it's like, okay, we're seeing that rotation.

So it's helped balancing

me, not to mention that NVX is 50%

up and UU's up 9%.

Spec stocks were due for a correction. This

isn't correction. This is a blip

right now. We're not even close to a correction yet.

Unless the IWM falls 10%, you're

not in correction yet. Do you think

an all-world ETF is a good choice?

I'm going to be real with you, and this

is my opinion. An all-world

ETF is almost pointless now

because the U.S. stock market

is so fucking large and

there's so much

outside money invested in it as well

and it's so interconnected that

if you're buying another

country to counter it and the

U.S. market fucking collapses,

they're all going down.

This isn't like 1995

where if the U.S. stock market goes

into a bear territory, another market

might go up to hedge against it.

I'm not talking about little dip

and something. I'm talking about action. If you're thinking the U.S. market

is going to fall 25-30%, you're

basically fucking the rest of the

world is going to do it too.

Okay? So, you know,

you might

maybe blip one or two

percent different because

you've got other markets that might be a little bit more stable

at a time, but when it

bounces back up or rebounds, you're going to

miss out on all that return because all the money's

going to flow back in the U.S. market and not into those other markets.

When America sneezes,

the world catches a cold. And if you say

that, people think that you are

like a

you know, American

you know,

superiority kind of bullshit. Like,

oh, fucking exceptionalism over here.

No, it's just how it is. People can't separate

their emotions from money. So, they hear you

say that and they're like, oh, you guys think you're just so

big because you're America. You're not as big and smart.

You're not going to last forever. It's like, bro, I'm not...

Nobody fucking said that. You brought that to the table.

We're just talking about how the market and the world's work right now.

It's not about that. The U.S. might

slowly become underperforming while its other

nations take over slowly a long period of time.

So, you're going to go ahead and

stop investing in the U.S. market

because there's a chance that this other thing

could happen. Go for it.

I'm kind of like,

if I see that happening, then I'll do it.

But until then, I'm going to stick with what's going on.

You know what I mean?

I see it happening. Then put all your money in some international shit.

Hey, you want to know

something that I got made fun of

a lot and I still get made fun of by people?

Vietnam ETF. Right?

I want you to look at something.

Let's look at SPY versus Vietnam.

We said Vietnam is most likely

the most emerging market, one of the top emerging

markets in the world. I was thinking about China

not Vietnam. I'm just giving an example, right?

So, there you go. There's your Vietnam ETF.

Right? Underperforming there.

But if you zoom in, okay,

over the past, just over the past few months,

right in line with it.

See what I mean? It's like the rest

of the world's kind of there.

Okay? Everything is

so interconnected, even the smaller markets.

No, I mean by VTI instead of

VU or whatever, right?

Look at Vietnam's market here. Vietnam,

while it's been up pretty big

over the past,

I guess over the past

few months, this one's still

but see how it's all intertwined there?

Vietnam just got added to the

the 2026

emerging market list

as well. The reason that I sold

my Vietnam position, we sold it for a pretty big gain.

The reason that I sold it though was because

the whole thing with

where everybody was moving out of

China into other countries in Southeast Asia,

Vietnam kind of like lost that

stranglehold because the whole

trade war kind of pushed

a lot of the

corporations and manufacturers into other

countries instead of naturally into Vietnam.

Your line failed you?

Well, as I said earlier, not

following this exact line, but this pattern.

So,

technically, we're still kind

of there.

How's the moon cycle system working? I've been out

before today. I haven't followed the moon cycle thing.

Plus one L? Okay, I'll give you

an L. Damn.

Shit, I had so many L's yesterday. I lost

fucking 12 fucking

casino chips because my wife thought they were

toys and gave them to the kids and then I donated them to a

goddamn

Goodwill or fucking

I think it was Goodwill or Salvation Army and

she thought they were the ones that we got at TwitchCon

which they were not. They were black chips

from the local Hard Rock

that were in a drawer near my

nightstand

and she was cleaning up and she

gave them to the kids to play with thinking they were the toys

and then I put them in a bag for me to donate

and

there were 12 chips, yeah.

12 black chips. If you learn from your

mistakes, they are investments.

Alright, we have to get to

call in

Zillow's and

ReactAndy shit because

it is what is Friday, even though

D-Gen Fridays are no longer D-Gen.

Which, hey, you know what? I've been following

my stream

stuff and it turns out that

whatever the fuck I've been doing for the past several months

is working because, hey look! We were right about

VIX falling.

It's been working, so

apparently the streams have been better than ever

so I guess

doing just whatever we're doing is working, but

I still have to keep with tradition.

So, let's do that.

How high do you think CatX will go?

Oh, I'm already out of CatX. That was one of our

main play today, or one of our main plays today.

It actually was a nice trade this morning.

It's cool.

Alright. How will I have our financial

recovery?

McDonald's. We're going to McDonald's.

We're just going to go to McDonald's.

We're going to do the Monopoly game. That's what we're going to do.

Why the fuck did you even buy that stock?

That was our Topher Yolo today.

We do Topher Yolos every day.

No, the McDonald's Monopoly game is back.

We could just start another Monopoly

crime ring. Hey wait, we're making

money on Macs? Ten free

codes per day? Oh really? I don't even

go to McDonald's, so I don't know.

Thanks for Macs. What are you thanking me for?

You thank yourself for being a fucking Chad and

not a fucking, or an alpha, not a pussy.

You realize the last ten times they cheated

and didn't pay out right? Thank you for

making me an alpha? That's right, now buy my course

and I'll teach you how to be an alpha every day.

You guys know about the

McDonald's Monopoly

game crime ring, right?

Is Unc sponsored

now? Yo, I pay a lot of

money to bullshit corporations so I don't receive

ads. Stop advertising?

Advertising what?

First off, you don't sub to my

channel, so you watch ads. So

as much as you want to bring down the system and

hate corporations, you're literally

voluntarily taking fucking

advertisers from them. So

first off, you lost that battle, son.

And uh, we were talking about

about something else.

This isn't an ad for McDonald's, it was a joke.

You know what? Fuck that guy.

You know what? I'mma teach you something, son.

Alright, let me tell you about this, alright? Since apparently

you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, because

uh, I was talking about something else.

I'mma tell you about the guy

and the, and the, who

who ended up

leading a fucking international crime

ring and cheated the

Monopoly game. Okay?

That's what I'm about to do. Here we go with this wild

bullshit again? What do you mean wild bullshit? You don't like

my whiteboards? You don't want me to do a whiteboard?

You hate my whiteboards?

You don't want to hear about a crime ring

and

why you, why until a

documentary came out, no one knew about it?

Can you wait 90 seconds for him? He's watching

an ad right now? Oh, that's fair.

Fuck it, I'm about to bust out the whiteboard.

You give me a chance, you give me a chance

to fucking nerd out on history

and finance and, and crime? I'm gonna do it.

Can you make this fun again, Stocky?

Make what fun again?

Unk getting old retelling stories? Oh, I told the story

before? Okay, then I won't do it.

Okay, that's cool. Okay, if I, if I've talked

about it before or whatever, then I'll just do the other stuff.

Alright.

Down 1% more, Vu stockpile? Yeah, I

bought it earlier. I don't think I've told it before.

Alright, fuck it, I'm gonna tell you about this.

And then we'll get into everything else.

Alright, let me tell you about this. Alright.

Don't look at Max. Why? I, I bought it.

Did it fall?

Alright, here you go. I'm gonna tell you this real quick, because I think it's a

really cool piece of, uh,

really cool piece of history. Alright, so let me tell you about this.

Some of y'all might know about this.

So, when I was a kid, I remember

the Monopoly game, man. That was crazy.

So McDonald's, for those of you guys who don't, like,

kill your body with bad food,

McDonald's has this, uh,

this game, right? And it's, uh,

it was the Monopoly game, and it's been out for a while.

And this was back in the, back in the 80s,

right? And so, what happened was,

is McDonald's originally launched

this game, okay? And

it was, you know, basically

where you would get little pieces for the Monopoly

board or whatever, and if you matched certain pieces,

right, you would, you would, you would win prizes.

And they would put the little stickers out

there, and they would send them all over the country, right?

And, and, and put them out there. And on

certain items, you would, you would buy them. But,

it, you didn't have to buy

them to get the tickets. People didn't know that, because they couldn't

be a lottery. So, everyone knows

Monopoly game, right? And if you match certain pieces,

then you get free,

you know, fries or drink, all the way up

to, like, TVs and stuff like that, cars,

and they even introduce million dollar prizes. So,

let me take you back. Guy named Jerome

Jacobson, okay?

For those who are just joining, coming out of ads,

let's talk about,

basically what we're doing is, is, I'm gonna talk about

the McDonald's Monopoly scam that

fucking shook the world, okay?

Jerome Jackson, this guy was an ex-cop,

right? And the reason he was an ex-cop

is he had this really bad, he had a disease that really fucked up

his foot, right? And so, he,

you know, decides he needs to get a

job. And what do most cops do when they get into the

private world, right? They go private investigator, they go

security, private security. So, he ends

up working security for a company called

Diddler Bros, okay? I'm dead

serious. So, he starts working

for Diddler Bros

printing, okay?

Now, he is the security,

the head of security for Diddler Bros.

And he's working there, and

six years later, McDonald's introduces

this game, okay? Well,

they introduce this game, and they

need somebody to print up all of these tickets.

Well, guess who they decide? That's right, they go

with Diddler Bros. And

they do that. And Simon Marketing, who's

really well known for this, is in charge

of that. They're holding, you know, this

closely, right? So, they're working in tandem, okay?

Well, Jerome, being

the head of security, is now

in charge of guarding

and transporting all of these little tickets,

right? These little stickers and tickets for the Monopoly

game. Well,

they were keeping this really

intense, right? So, they put it in a vault,

where two people had to turn a key simultaneously.

It was a six-inch

steel door to get through.

It was pretty wild. And they

were carried in these tamper-proof envelopes.

So, you've probably seen them, right? You put

them in there, and you put the tickets

in here, and then you pull this little strap that

has a thing, and it seals it, right?

And there's no way of, like,

you know, opening it up without

knowing that it was open, right? So, it's tamper-proof, right?

So, you've got this.

Well, here's what happened.

Old JJ is transporting

these, and he has inside

knowledge of this, and he finds out that the game

is actually rigged. Wait,

how's it rigged? Well, not what you're thinking.

So, what happens is, is they use a

computer to

randomize and send things out, but they were

sending the winning tickets to Canada,

right? They had

tickets were getting, you know, it was picking Canada.

So, the company had to go in

and reprogram the software

to keep doing it until it picks

somewhere in the United States.

They didn't even reprogram it. They just kept running it until it was

in the United States. So, he goes, wait a second.

Wait a second.

They're rigging this game, technically.

So, he sees it can be rigged.

So, in 1989,

okay, he's transporting

these tickets. Everything's

going fine. He has this idea. He understands it.

Then, the moment happens.

Remember how I said they were getting those

tamper-proof envelopes? Well, the company

who sent the tamper-proof

envelopes sent an extra box by

mistake, and it lands on

his desk. Well, guess what?

Old JJ now has

his own

tamper-proof envelopes that no one else

knows about but him. Okay?

Inventory, everything is counted.

No one is the wiser.

Okay? Well,

here's what he decided to do. They had

a female auditor that would follow him

around, right, to keep an eye on him during the transport

to make sure he had eyes on him just in case,

buddy system, stuff like that. Well,

here's what he would do. He

would stuff winning tickets in his

pockets. Okay?

And

what he would do is, is he would

switch them with the

common tickets. And he would

dip into airport bathrooms,

male bathrooms when she couldn't go in,

and he would switch them out

and take his tamper-proof envelope

and switch the tickets

with the common ones. Right?

Okay? So,

he knew, or sorry,

sorry, backwards. He would stuff his, let me try that again.

He would stuff his pockets with the common

ones, knowing that the bag had the winning

ones, would go in, unseal it,

switch them out, and then get his own

one and reseal it. Come out, looks like

nothing, nothing's a problem, right? Because he can't

leave it out in the airport. He's a security, so he's got to take it

in with him. She couldn't see that. Alright?

But here's the problem.

He's got the winning tickets, but he

can't redeem them himself, right? Because

everyone would realize the guy that's in charge of

transporting these is winning. He can't do that. He can't do that.

So he starts selling them to people.

He starts selling the winning fucking McDonald's

tickets. Now,

remember,

oh, I'm going to get to another part. Let me get to it in a second. So he

has to sell them. So he starts small.

So he starts selling them to people that he knew

and giving some to his family, because back then they didn't

track it as much, right? He gave one

$25,000 winning ticket, because that

was one of the top prizes back then, to his stepbrother.

He even sold a $10,000 winning ticket

to a butcher for $2,000, right? So he was like

making a pretty good return on this. But he was being

careful, small-timing it.

But then it got a little bit crazier.

Okay? It got a little bit crazier.

Some employee in Wisconsin

stole a $3,000

ticket roll. Okay?

Now, the reason that they had rolls

at the McDonald's is

is that they

had to make it where it wasn't a

lottery. You could technically

go to the McDonald's, you can do that now,

except it's digital now, and ask them for

a free ticket. That way,

it wasn't considered a lottery. Because if

only by buying something can you

get a chance at winning, that's a lottery.

But if you give people the chance to walk up and

just ask for it for free, it's no longer a lottery.

They don't tell you that, because

they don't want to encourage it. Okay?

So, there you go.

Next thing you know, armed

robberies. So what did they start doing? They started securing

the rolls at the front desk.

Well, Jacobson had to lay low, right?

Because a lot of eyes on this, because this guy stole this

big spool, so now McDonald's and the authorities

are watching who gets these tickets and trying

to track it back. So he lays low for a little bit.

Okay? Then

McDonald's comes out and raises the stakes.

They put the tickets

on everything. Fries,

nuggets, anything you buy, they put

a ticket on. They're raising the stakes, right?

Because now they know if they put it on all

of those, people will buy more, they're going to make more

revenue. Alright, well here we go.

Here's where it all turned. He goes from

small time, and he's on one of his

little airport trips, and he meets a guy, right?

He meets a guy whose last name is

Colombo. Anybody know why

the last name Colombo is important here?

That's right. That's

the Mafia. Okay? The Colombo

family was a big

Mafia family in New York City.

Okay? Now, not the

second TV show, okay?

Big crime family in New York City.

They give J.J. the nickname

Uncle Jerry, okay?

Old Uncle Jerry.

Now, they could quadruple the size

of the scam, right? They quadruple. They get more people

involved. They get a lot more people involved.

And Jacobson

started, starts getting cash

directly, right? So Colombo starts

working as the middleman, right? He gives

Jerome the money, just cash directly,

right? He gets money

under the table, he's keeping it quiet.

He gets the money, he gives the tickets to Colombo. Colombo

finds ways of distributing the

tickets and then making more money on top

of it. So now they got this big thing

going on, right? They even started

getting family members to fly

to another state and claim the

winning ticket there, saying they bought it there, right?

Because you can't all be in fucking, like, Jacksonville, Florida

or something. You have to find,

make it look like it's different. This is the 80s, so it wasn't

quite as much easy to track stuff. So they would fly

to there and say, oh my god, I got a winning ticket!

And they would all win. Everything's going good.

They basically turned America into their own

little fucking monopoly board. Like, this is, like, legit.

Well, Jacobson starts buying

homes and cars. Because what do you do

when you start making money and you're getting away with it?

You start thinking you're untouchable. So he starts buying houses

and cars and all kinds

of shit. Like, he's having a good time. He's a fucking

security guard, right? It's a little bit weird that he does it,

but, you know, eh, whatever. People are,

you know, they try to put it in different people's names and shit.

They're doing what they're doing. Well,

uh, he ends up changing

his name. He wants to sound like a mobster. So he

starts going by the name, uh,

Geraldo Constantino. Not

Jerome Jacobson. Geraldo Constantino.

Well, guess

what? All good things must come to an

end. Columbo gets killed

in a car accident. But

his wife lives.

Well, something's

a little suspicious here. Okay?

Something's a little suspicious here. Alright?

The Columbo family

suspects she may have orchestrated

this or known about it or had something to do

with it. Okay?

So now, JJ

or Geraldo Constantino doesn't have

the mafia connection anymore. So he's got to find

a different connection. So he meets two new guys.

And they want to take this shit international.

Okay? They want to take this international.

The problem is, is that these guys

weren't an organized crime family. They didn't know what the fuck

they were doing. So what do they do? One of the guys

gives, they start giving out the tickets to like

ex-crime members that were like put in jail

and put in work or whatever to try to like

give them a payback. They give one of the winning

tickets to a guy who had been

fucking previously, uh, charged

with drug trafficking.

You see what I mean? So now you're putting money in places

where people are already being, being, uh,

uh, you know, watched and

surveilled. So now, things are getting a little bit

crazy. Well, here's the thing.

Jerry hands out

18 winning tickets.

12 of which are million dollar

winners. They fucking up the stakes. These are the

million dollar winners. Now this is back in when

a million dollars was worth more.

In 2000 though, it all comes to a head.

Why?

The FBI gets a

tip that one of the

tickets, one of the million dollar tickets might not

be so legitimate. Right?

And who was the

owner of that ticket? Anybody?

Columbo's wife's

dad.

People think the Columbo family did this to get

retribution. Remember the guy who went to

New Hampshire and all that shit? Yeah.

So, here we go. He squeals.

Uncle Jerry

is, uh, is named. Nobody knows

who Uncle Jerry is, but he's named.

And then the FBI started interviewing a lot of

the winners. Turns out, they're

home address that they put down wasn't legit.

Right?

They weren't living in those states where they claimed

that they did because they just filled it out. Nobody

did any background checks. Turns out, all the money was

being wired back to the same place in Jacksonville.

So they started tracking the calls.

20,000 phone calls

were tracked. And they were

honing in on fucking Uncle Jerry here.

They're honing in on him.

Well, here's the thing. McDonald's is about

to start up their bi-annual McDonald's

game again. And the FBI

contacts him and tells him, hey, there's some, there's

something going on. There's somebody

fucking, like, rigging this

game. And so McDonald's wants to back

out of it. They're like, alright, fine, we don't want to be a part of

this, whatever. But the FBI says,

no, let's do it one more time. We're this

close. Let's do it one more time.

So, sure as shit, McDonald's runs

it out again. Okay?

Then, the McSting

happens. A bunch

of FBI agents pretend that they're

like from a news crew or some, like, television

organization and they want to interview and do a story

on one of the winners. So they

find one of the winners. He's

interviewed. And they catch his

ass. And that

is how they end up

you know,

just taking down this entire fucking

organization. This whole, this crime

organization. Now,

here's the thing, though.

The story's not over. We're almost there. Stick

with me. I know this isn't your normal story, but I love

these kind of fucking stories, right? So now

we've got this all the way down to the, to

the thing. They finally track

Jacobson. They get

Jacobson. And

he confesses,

but with a twist.

He tells the FBI,

I want you to go easy on me. Why?

Well, remember when the

McDonald's first started giving out the million dollar

thing? I gave a million

dollar ticket to St. Jude.

True story. That was his, that

was his hopefully get out of jail free

card. They didn't give a shit.

Okay?

He gets, you know,

he goes to court now.

They're going for, they're going, the court proceedings are about to

start. Now, you might say to yourself,

well, Stocky, how come I never heard

about this? Or how come I never heard about it before the 2020

documentary HBO did?

Well, there's a reason why this didn't

get talked about much. And one of the reasons

he didn't get that crazy of a sentence.

The court proceedings

began

on September

10th, 2001.

So instead of this being

a huge international fucking story

about this crime thing with McDonald's,

and everything, the world

was focusing on something else.

McDonald's was a part-time

job. Huh?

Alright, moving on. How did this all come to a head?

Jacobson got

37 months in prison.

Was ordered to pay 12 million

dollars back to McDonald's.

And McDonald's was able to

go back and recover

almost all of the money.

All the tickets, all the money, and stuff like that.

Either through restitution, through judgments, or

through, you know, payments, or fucking, you know,

decorations or everything. Except...

McDonald's only didn't go after

one prize and one ticket. Anybody wanna

guess which one they let keep?

Because PR

is a motherfucker.

That's right, St. Jude's got to keep the

money. St. Jude's

kept their money, okay? Because McDonald's

was not about to go ask St. Jude's

for a million dollars back. Ain't

no way in hell there is

anybody who even, even the most fucking

brain-dead fucking, like, you know,

worst fucking PR person in the world

that works for any corporation is not

gonna be like, yeah, we should get our money

back from St. Jude's. Okay?

So,

to the guy thinking I brought up the

McDonald's thing as a way of us making our

money as an ad,

no, it was a joke about this

story about

how the, the, the

McDonald's Monopoly game became

a mob-fucking

funded racketeering

scam, and, and

so there you go. There's, there's, there's your, there's

your whiteboard breakdown. Okay?

That was a Trump rant?

Why do y'all hate my whiteboards

so much? I like them.

You're sponsored by the mob? No.

That was coherent and fron- interesting.

What, why do you say that like, that, that,

that was, that, that's not normal?

You seem surprised.

Thanks for the cat X YOLO today, Stocky.

You saved my portfolio. Okay, first off,

I didn't save it. Second of all, I got stopped

out. What is it at right now?

Jesus motherfucking Mary of Christ.

I was legitimately

worried this morning. Look at this.

This is what I said this morning at

8 o'clock. I may

have bought too much cat X.

Apparently I didn't buy enough

and I didn't hold it long enough.

Dude just episodeed a five episode HBO

doc in a blackout. I didn't, I've

never seen the documentary. I really wanna, now

I, now that, now that I'm thinking about it, I'd love

to see that documentary. Damn it.

We're now up

a hundred and

sixty-one percent on

AVX. Yo, MLTX!

Oh shit, we did it, boys!

DJens!

That kid is gonna win his fucking

school tuition.

Did you see the, did you watch the Ed Gein movie?

You used to tell us that story on stream.

No, I haven't. I haven't watched anything on,

I started watching something on Netflix the other day

and I got twenty minutes into the first

episode. That was three weeks ago.

I bet you this kid sold too. He's probably not even still

holding it anymore. Hell yeah, brother,

I'm boycotting Netflix too.

No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, don't get me started up in that shit. It has nothing to do with a boycott

of anything. I just, I have kids. I ain't got time

for this shit. No, I'm not like intentionally

not watching Netflix for any reason.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

That's, that's nothing to do with that.

Jesus, we're actually hanging on. We're actually doing

pretty good today considering the market.

Cause a lot of our shit is still doing well. NVX

is absolutely insane. We're up sixty-two percent today.

Uh, MO is up one and a half percent.

NNE is up three percent. MLTX

is up eleven percent. Walmart's up one percent.

Hive is up three percent.

Uh, VTR, Stubb, UUU

is up ten percent now. We're up over two hundred

percent on that. AbbVie's up one percent.

Um, we're hanging on pretty

well. Are you in TSSI?

Yes. Um,

wait, what are we boycotting Netflix for?

We're not. Thanks for the Cypher

signal last week. I think it was

two weeks ago and it wasn't a signal. I sold

though. I made a pretty decent gain on that. How's it

doing right now? Oh, God.

Fuck. You sold a bit at twenty?

Damn, you got the top there.

XX is still going. Hey, we were right

about the pattern. I even drew it. I said,

I think it's gonna fall exactly, but I think we're gonna get this

general pattern. It actually did. That's funny.

The problem is, is that

the line has run out.

And when the line runs out,

it always, you know,

immediately, like, goes

the opposite direction. And so I see it

as a down pattern. That means,

that means you have to take calls.

Not you, but like, okay.

Alright, here's what we're gonna do.

I am going to get to

Zillows and Collins. What time do I have to pick up?

I have to pick up my daughter before two.

So I have to leave here by

1.40, which means I don't have time

for the gym again today.

Which means I have to take my son, so that means

I have to be off stream by one.

Alright, we are doing Zillows and Collins.

Okay, here's the thing. No more thing. We're not gonna do

any more news now unless we run out of stuff.

Zillows, Collins, and React to any content immediately.

I'm gonna eat a protein bar so I can

have some energy and we're gonna run marbles and then we're going straight

into it, okay? We're going straight into it.

Alright, we're gonna go straight into it.

So, before we do this, if you have any, if you

remember Collins, I've explained it a million times.

Collins are open to anybody. It is completely anonymous.

You just call me directly on Discord. We talk.

No one knows your name. No one can see you. It's completely anonymous.

You can talk about anything you want. You can ask any questions you want.

You can ask advice. You can tell me I'm wrong. You can debate me.

You can ask for life advice.

I can rate something. I can give you an opinion on something.

Whatever. You can just get something off your chest.

That's fine. It's anonymous. You do whatever you want.

If you don't want to do that, you can type in

and I'll read it out loud.

You still won't know who you are.

If you want me to see a Zillow or a PC

of content or whatever,

send it to me directly. We're going to do that right now

because I know some of you guys get really pissed off

when I miss that on a weekend or before a weekend

because this is your last day before the weekend. You want to get out

a little stupid. So, let's do that. Hurry up, Marbles.

Real quick. I've got to eat something and then we're going to do this.

Okay? Rate my cat.

I DM'd you. Well, if I get to it,

we will. He refers

to rate boobs, so send him boob pictures.

I got a boob picture last week

and I rated it off stream.

It was guys boobs,

but I gave him an honest rating.

He's anonymous. Nobody knows who he is.

All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in.

We don't have much time. We don't have much time.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Get in. Get in. Get in.

It is time

to go.

Let's go. Jesus.

EnvyX is insane, huh?

Those look like chicken feet.

That reminds me of Nate's.

Broasty, I'm actually happy you won.

We used to always be so angry in here.

Now you're kind of like become one of us.

I'm in.

I went, I full ported spy zero day calls.

Wish me luck.

That's not what I said.

I did not tell you to do that.

I did not tell you to do that.

That is stupid.

All right.

That's not what the chart says.

Oh no, it's going up.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Spies up $2 since.

Oh my God.

Stupid.

MLTX going absolutely wild.

Good, good, good, good, good, good, good call on that guys.

All right.

All right.

Let's do it.

Let's do it.

I'm going to jump into discord right now and we're going to watch this or we're going to

do this and here and see what's going on.

So we are going to go in right now.

Feel free to ignore if you want to do fun stuff.

Stocky, can you explain why Verizon is pumping on anti-China news or at least or was at least?

Yes.

As we said, if there is any volatility in this market, no one is actually capitulating

in this market.

We might see a rotation into divvies, but it is not pumping anymore because people are

scared about Verizon's new CEO with PayPal.

Plus our ex divvy date is coming up.

All right.

What else do we got?

Who would win or in a race to who, who would win in a race to run a hundred meters and

eat a hot dog, Joey chestnut or Usain Bolt?

Who would win in a race to run a hundred meters and eat a hot dog?

Are they eating a hot dog?

Cause the way you wrote this, they're eating a hot dog while they're running or do they

run and then eat the hot dog?

If it's run and then eat, it would be Usain Bolt.

Because.

He's going to get at least 10, 15 seconds on Joey chestnut.

And even if Joey chestnut fucking just throat goaded the glizzy, Usain Bolt wouldn't need

more than that to eat it.

So Usain Bolt would win that.

Plus Usain Bolt, uh, has to eat a lot of calories to keep up.

So he's probably, you know, he, it's not going to be a problem for him.

What is a hundred meters?

I'm not a communist.

Um, it's, uh, it's like a football field.

God, you're just so wrong.

No way.

Joey takes 25 seconds.

We're on a hundred meters.

I mean, either way.

I mean, even if it's, I don't know, man.

I mean, he, he, he didn't look like he's in good shape.

Now, if you said a hundred meters in like five hot dogs or 10 hot dogs, and maybe we'd be

talking about this, but Usain Bolt's start to finish and eat it would be faster than

Joey chestnut.

Because here's the thing.

Even if Joey chestnut goes and swallows it down, Usain Bolt goes, that's going to take

what?

Two, three, four, five seconds.

He's going to beat that on the, on the 100 meters.

Usain Bolt is fat now.

Well, I don't know what Usain Bolt, whatever.

I mean, there's a video of him doing it of who doing it.

Joey chestnut running a hundred meters and eating a hot dog.

How does timescale affect trading?

The longer you wait, generally, the better you do because you can outlast dips and you

don't paper hands things.

The person who asked this question thinks that Usain Bolt would take 15 seconds to eat

a hot dog.

Let's time 15 seconds.

Okay.

Let's time 15 seconds.

All right.

I'm going to pretend I'm eating a hot dog.

Okay.

Bun and all, and let's do 15 seconds and just see how long that really is.

Okay.

All right, here we go.

15 seconds.

Okay.

You're running and you're in a competition.

Here we go.

I'm going to pretend this is a hot dog.

Okay.

All right, here we go.

Ready?

One, two, three, go.

That's 10 seconds.

And I was being conservative.

Okay.

If you're really pushing that shit in your mouth, I mean, maybe, I don't know.

I mean, that's a tough.

That's a tough one.

Is it hot out?

Is it raining out?

Do they get water?

I've watched you eat a banana in two bites.

Well, a banana goes down your throat a lot easier.

Now, are they eating the hot dog first and then running?

I mean, that's a weird fucking question.

Okay.

That's not what we're here for.

Okay.

All right.

What else do we got coming in?

I just got a Monopoly game ad.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Really?

Are we expecting a bigger dip?

What do you mean expecting?

I mean, how big and how long is what you're...

How big of a dip and how long?

Time?

I mean, this market, everyone has bought up everything so fast, so I don't expect it

to last long, you know, unless Trump does or says something else that would, you know,

make it seem like they're actually going to put real fucking tariffs in and they're going

to keep them and all that shit.

Like, it doesn't, based on, you know, based on what we've seen from this market, because

the market and the economy are not the same, so it's just, you know, obviously, you know,

to each their own, but I don't think it's going to last too long.

Nobody's capitulating right now.

All right.

Got our first Zillow of the day.

Let's take a look at it.

Here we are.

It is time for Stocky to sell you this house.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the stream where I am given a Zillow.

I have never seen it.

You have never seen it.

I am your real estate agent.

You are my client.

We are going to go into this house and I am going to try to sell it to you no matter what

and we are going to do it together.

So, here we are.

We are heading to...

138 Armenia Road in Sharon, Connecticut.

Okay.

Nine bedrooms, eight baths, 12,057 square feet, $7,500.

I'm sorry, $7,500...

$7.5 million.

Seized a rare opportunity to own this.

It is the most distinguished gilded age estate designed in 1903.

Okay.

1903.

Near a hospital too, which is great.

And built in 1903.

This is a big property.

Let's take a look at it together.

Ladies and gentlemen, here we are.

A little bit foggy of a day, but here we are.

You can see that this is a very, you know, quaint estate right now.

Definitely looks like something that, you know, was, you know, I don't know,

somebody that was on the Titanic kind of owned, right?

Nice little bench here to read your book, you know, when you're wearing your corset or whatever.

But it's got that very vintage feel.

I love it here.

Nice little look.

Very Mount Vernon kind of look, right?

Kind of makes you feel like you're on an estate from the 1700s.

But, yeah, it's gorgeous there.

Obviously, you know, if you can afford this house, you're probably going to have to pay for some lawn care

unless you just like getting out of the house and not having to deal with your fucking kids, right?

Here we go.

I don't know why it's always so foggy there.

Maybe they just had a bad day to take pictures here.

You can see the road leading up to it isn't very well worn,

so it means that the house probably isn't that well worn,

which is nice because when you're in an estate like this,

you kind of want to get away from it all and kind of own it.

You know, very, very, like I said, very, you know, Roman, you know,

accents here.

It's inspired by, you know, plant, not plantations, Jesus fucking Christ,

estates from early America.

So beautiful here, you know, lots of old money.

Again, very foggy in this area here.

Not sure what happened to this tree branch here.

Looks like it fell and just fucking exploded or something else did,

but you got yourself a little, these little things here to kind of like welcome you in and out of the house.

There you go.

That's beautiful.

That's, you know, I,

that's gorgeous right there.

That's your morning walk right there.

You know what I mean?

That is, that is exactly where I expect a serial killer to pop out and just say,

hey, good morning, neighbor.

Good morning to you too, you know?

Here we are a little bit dated on the stones here,

probably just because a car has probably run into it a lot.

That's probably why they haven't drove a while.

They probably, older people that, that eventually after running into these fucking things have decided,

you know what, maybe we're not going to drive anymore.

So again, you can, you know, backhoe this road out or you could just use it for bicycles or morning walk.

Here you go.

You got a guest house or what we would call a in-law house,

which is beautiful because you don't want them too close to you, right?

You want to make them have to put an effort to come see you.

And so, you know, it's like, fuck it.

If I'm gonna have to deal with them, I'm going to, I'm going to, you know,

I'm gonna put them as far away as possible, but it's always nice.

Again, Roman inspired architecture here.

Beautiful.

God, it's really foggy, really foggy there.

Just wow.

But here you go.

You have an actual zebra that was murdered by someone that lived here and skinned for a ritual that was made into a ritual.

A rug.

I mean, you don't often get a zebra rug.

Okay.

It's actually illegal.

Now.

This was probably been there for a hundred years.

Little bit less foggy here.

This is where you can sit across from each other and realize that you live in a loveless marriage and that you are only together for tax purposes.

And for, for, for, you know, your philanthropy that you got to do to lower your income so that you can actually also save taxes.

And you can sit here and have a picture of something that used to be beautiful when you didn't have to pretend as hard.

And there's even a little ink quill here.

Well, you can write a letter so you don't have to talk to them and say, my dearest spouse, you have withered like a rose in the desert before my eyes.

And then they can write back.

Speaking of deserts, my vagina has been one for 40 years, looking at your face every day.

And you could do that.

It's like on the fun form of communication.

You know what I mean?

It's like at the telephone game, right?

Here we are more, more fog.

But a beautiful archway there.

You got some, some, some hand carved faces up there.

Kind of reminds you of Game of Thrones, right?

Little, little, little, little, little interesting there.

But great hardwood floor.

This is, this is where you, you, you can go and be alone.

And there's no TV.

We always, you know, it's funny.

We always talk about how we miss the 90s.

We miss time before the internet.

We miss time before your phone.

Well, guess what?

Put your fucking phone down.

Guess what?

You're back in the fucking 90s.

Get on your bike.

Go play outside.

Stop using that as an excuse as to why you miss your, the, the childhood when we were so disconnected.

Get the fuck, no one's forcing you to be on your goddamn phone, okay?

No one's forcing you to be in front of a fucking computer.

You're on a computer complaining about always being on the fucking interconnected.

Put the shit down and go outside and ride a bike.

I miss when we could ride bikes and do these things.

Go ride a fucking bike.

It's just not the same.

No, no, like put your phone down and do it.

Yeah, but what if somebody, you know, likes my post?

That, that like is going to be there in an hour.

Go fucking ride a bike.

Yeah, but I don't have anybody else.

To ride a bike with.

We'll tell them put their fucking phone down too and go ride bikes.

Fuck.

I invited my neighbor to a water balloon fight the other day.

I bought, you know, what's funny.

I bought that.

I went to Goodwill and I found that game ladder.

What is it called?

Ladder throw or whatever where you have like the things you have the balls, two balls.

And they're connected together and you just, you just, you know, throw them and it hooks on the ladder.

Bro, we've been having so much fun outside.

You know what I mean?

But here you go here.

Here you can, you can write your will.

Which you will have to update.

Every few weeks as you find people that you hate and you love.

Very, very, very cool.

Great, great for just getting away.

Another lot of zebras died in the making of this of this home.

I wonder if they ever lived on the estate.

Maybe they live there because you were rich and you just died of natural causes.

Lots of books.

At some point.

I feel like you could probably just buy another bookshelf rather than stacking these on the floor.

Lots of paintings to maybe there's some money there to help pay for this.

Even more books fun fact.

For my fellow boomers out there.

Remember the encyclopedias that used to have you have to all those encyclopedias that that was there.

Those used to cost $4,000 for a complete set.

You know that upwards of four grand for a complete set of the encyclopedias.

Okay, at this point in the house.

I can't tell if this is dust or fog, but either way still gorgeous.

Look at that big Sun.

You can't see the Sun outside, but you can pretend it's there with that piece of art in the background.

Here is where you eat dinner.

But you never eat with anyone else.

You always eat alone unless you have company over, but you don't have company, right?

You don't have company.

And so there's just two chairs.

They're not together at the table because people the two people who live here eat separately.

Why you have a third chair off to the side here.

I'm not sure.

Maybe it's because you're hoping that your children who grew up and left the home and never called you and you never even bother to visit again because they grew up in a fucking horrible hostile environment.

Actually fucking hate both of you, but you leave it there just in case they come home one day, even though they're now in their 40s and live somewhere else completely opposite you in the country and and have kids that you don't you've never met in real life.

But yeah, there you go.

You can tell by that painting right there because nobody quite nothing quite says a happy home like two dead deers a fucking cult a son and a dog painting.

Yeah, there you go.

Here you go.

This is a woman with a stag.

This is just how what your wife.

Reminded bought so she could look and say what she wishes she could have in her life.

That's right.

And three chairs all looking at each other next to a fireplace.

This is where finances are discussed with the lawyer.

This is when this the only time you and your significant other husband or wife ever sit next to each other because you're mediated by either a lawyer in a state planner or financial advisor or a couple's therapist.

I don't know.

Here you go.

You can tell that this isn't used because nobody who uses their table all the time has a.

Has has nice white cloth on the table.

It's for looks.

Obviously, you got to put up, you know, you got to put up the show and you can see a giant bottle of wine that is empty after every single dinner because you got to get drunk.

I just getting really depressing.

Oh my God.

It's sunny.

Hold on.

It's sunny.

Wait a second.

Then like I would the mood is changing.

The mood is changing.

Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, what the fuck?

Why did you have a what you brother brother?

Ooh, what is this?

That's some weird shit.

Like we are you into like do they hunt?

People on this?

Is this like a human hunting ranch?

This isn't even a home.

Okay, I take everything back that I've said someone or multiple people have been murdered on this property and they ended up on a milk carton somewhere.

They're buried on this property.

Someone is searching in like fucking New Jersey for that body, but they're here in Connecticut.

Holy hell.

And that's where they're buried right there.

Holy shit.

This changed.

Okay, everything makes sense.

Now.

This is like the Rothschild hunting.

Lodge in in Europe.

If you know, you know what?

Why did we start with this picture?

Why did we start with this picture?

This is this is beautiful.

Look at this.

This is like rolling Hills and trees and it's all brightly lit.

Why didn't we start with this?

Who's in charge of this listing?

You could have started with this.

Look at look at the difference between this is so much different.

Wait, what happened?

Wait, wait, how did we how do we start here?

And end here?

These are AI.

Well, why didn't you start with that?

It's like that's like that's like putting your tinder profile up without your fucking makeup or your fucking filters on like you don't do that.

You start with deception because they want you to see what it actually looks like not fake pics.

Then why put these pictures on at all?

Ask for a visit, but then I would have to go to Connecticut.

I was about to say who go who intentionally goes to Connecticut.

But then again, I'm the first person in American history since the Revolutionary War to intentionally move to Delaware.

Yo, do you see MLTX today?

My dearest wife.

It has been ages since we have spoken in a non-compatible way.

Long have I yearned for the touch of your vagina.

So did you see MLTX today?

What was it?

What was what two days ago?

MLTX the touch.

You thought when I went all 50 Shades of Grey on your ass.

Why are you smiling?

Today's my day.

Okay, wait, wait, wait.

Hold on.

Let me run that back.

You said yesterday.

You told our daughter.

It's her day and she said and she said that means you can't say no to anything.

Mommy, no matter what I want to do two times three times four times five days, whatever.

And then you looked at me and said today is your day.

Yeah.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Hold on.

Hold on.

Why would you say that?

It's called teasing.

No, no, no, no.

So that's not teasing.

You're either a fucked up by saying that or be your weaponizing.

There's no teasing.

You don't get to tell a man.

Huh?

You don't want anything from me.

I'm broke.

Yeah.

Because.

You threw all of our money in the fight.

We donated it to Goodwill.

How much money was it?

I'm not going to tell you.

Oh, wait, today's the day.

Oh, I get it.

Because today's the day you're fasting.

Yeah, but we can't do anything.

No, because because because then you can't put any meat in your mouth, but you got other places.

You can put meat in.

I can think of three other holes.

All right, let's keep going.

What's the third one?

Didn't you have a c-section?

Okay, open that bad boy up again.

Huh?

My sense of humor is dark.

Well, my sense of humor.

I like my sense of humor.

It's like it.

Listen, I like my meat dart too.

Can you give her a mic so we can eavesdrop?

Whatever happened to those little mics?

Did you steal them?

Because I won't buy you a new phone.

I swear to God, you fucking Bitcoin is having a good week.

I have tried to buy you a phone forever.

Okay, first off.

This is okay.

Let me tell you a little story real quick.

We mean, how long am I keep trying?

You say the same thing about sex.

I never give up.

But here's the thing.

She's like, she's like.

I can't fit.

I can't even fill videos anymore for our YouTube channel.

I'm like why she's like because I don't be storage.

I'm like, well then just pay for more storage.

No, I'm not going to do that.

I'll just keep deleting things.

I'm like it's 99 cents a month for like like more gigs of storage.

That's just a waste of money.

I'm not going to do that.

I would just start delete.

You're going to delete our fucking memories.

So you can save 99 cents a month.

You can just put it on cloud.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

I can't even do cloud.

Storage because it just keep thinking everything.

Okay.

I'm like, you know, I get that, you know, she's like, she's like, you know, I'm Indian.

You wouldn't understand.

I'm like, no, I understand way more than you.

I was like, but that now she's like, well, you need to buy me a new phone.

I'm like, okay, cool.

I'll buy you.

Let's go buy you a new phone.

No, no, I want to wait till we get to Delaware.

We've been trying to move for two years.

Now, her phone doesn't work at all.

I'm like, let's go get you a new phone.

She's like, no, I think.

Okay, she goes.

Yeah, couple issues.

What are you getting me for my birthday?

I said.

A new phone.

I knew you were going to say that way.

I don't want a fucking new phone for my birthday.

I mean, what do you mean?

I want to follow my birthday.

I don't want to do that, but I think I'm just going to do it.

Like, I'm just going to do it to that.

I don't want that.

That's not what I want.

You supposed to get off.

What do you mean?

What do you what am I supposed to do?

So we'll get to Delaware.

I said, you're not getting my text messages anymore.

That's how bad your phone is.

She goes.

Yeah, but we just do in Delaware.

I said, I'm driving up to Delaware on my own for two days.

What the what if something fucking happens to me?

How do I reach out to you?

I think let's just get you a new phone.

She won't let me get her a new phone and then complains about it.

I don't get it.

You know how many new phones you could have got with all the fucking chips you

threw out.

I portray you with such a horrible weird person.

Someone who asked for presents ladies and gentlemen, if you're significant

other jokingly asked you what you're getting them for their birthday.

You're you're there a horrible person.

How about we talk about what we actually asked for?

Well, you don't want to talk about what I asked for for my.

Birthday.

You want to talk about it?

Oh, okay.

You're messing up our Zillow's and Collins, babe.

All right.

Let's see.

Let's go back into discord here.

What do we got?

Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

what we got here?

Rejects.

I'm not reviewing your portfolio.

God damn it.

All right.

Tuggy wants Tuggy.

You have to stop asking me for UFC pics, bro.

You have to stop asking me for UFC pics.

Wait, that's the guy who had the shitty tattoos that I.

Bet against last time.

Yeah, bro.

You got to go with the guy on the right.

I'm sorry.

I can't I can't stop.

I can't bet.

I have to bet against people with bad tattoos.

Okay.

All right.

I bet against this guy last time.

You guys said I was crazy because I said listen, it's not about putting your family on you, but you know that putting your family as a tattoo is going to make them look all fucking crazy weird or whatever and it's just it's not a good decision to do.

And if you make bad decisions in life, I got to take it as far as the ring.

I realize this guy is the underdog, but

I'm going with with matted gamer rot here.

I'm sorry.

Gamer rot is is who I have to go with here.

I can't I can't I have to I have to bet against the tattoos man.

I don't know.

I don't know why it says underdog here.

He's a favorite.

I have to go with him bro.

How dare you bet against Charles.

I bet against Charles last time and I was right.

I'm not saying I'm right this time, but I can't you listed bad decisions in and out of the ring man.

I'm actually 11 and 3 on UFC pics now.

And the funny thing is is two of the three losses.

I.

Changed I changed after the fact on what it by originally was.

So now I just go with my first gut instinct instinct.

Well, this isn't even gut instinct.

I just have to bet against it.

Stop making wrong pics.

I literally picked the other guy last week and you thought that I was crazy and he won and you even said I made a hundred and sixty bucks.

I bet on the guy who was the underdog and not only did he win he TK he KO in the first round the other guy.

All right.

What is this?

So Middle Ages and 50 it's 38 until we meet again.

Really wasn't necessary.

All right, what's this?

Oh, we got a crying video.

Is this some what's going on here?

Not again.

What is it?

Use Apple pay?

Honestly, just be so careful.

This is a little embarrassing to admit.

But if this could help one person that I'm really willing to share with should get hacked or something.

What the fuck?

My experience was I'm just going to lay it out like this when you use Apple pay, that's real money.

I would laugh but my wife found out that casino chips are real money too and didn't know that.

Babe.

Did you know that Apple pay is real money?

I didn't say that.

I just started using it for the first time.

I said, did you know there's a lady here who's actually in tears because she apparently found out that when you use Apple pay, it's real money.

Let me just hear the rest of it.

That's true.

American dollars from your credit card.

If you if you have your credit card connected, that's where the money is being sourced from.

It's where the fuck do you think you're you think Apple's just like eat like just giving you money.

What the not like a special form.

Of Apple pay Apple dollars.

Why they what the fuck is an apple dollar?

Okay, don't just say this is real money while you're paying.

I don't know because I thought that I had accumulated a bunch of Apple dollars to use for Apple pay by you.

Wait, she's being real.

She thought it was like cash back.

No spending so much time on my phone giving my data very freely and willingly to any place that ass like whatever they say our cookies.

Okay.

I say yes.

Yes.

Because I thought that's how I was getting prizes getting awards getting Apple dollars.

So I didn't think that was real money till I checked my credit card bill.

I I've been spending money.

Like I'm a friggin millionaire.

I got hair moves.

I'm straight hair.

My hair doesn't even hold moves.

I call Apple to straighten things out.

I look at it as a please speak with mr.

Steve Jobs.

They go.

He's no longer with us.

If this may be fake, I'm sure it probably is but there are people that legitimately.

Think this way.

I'm not even kidding you.

There are people you you think that this is completely you think that this is a joke.

There's not you think there aren't people that think this way.

Do you know how many people pay the minimum balance on the date due date for their credit card because they think that's what they have to pay in order to not get charged interest minimum do I did a video explaining the difference between statement balance.

Current balance and and and due date and how to avoid that 8 million views.

Okay, there are a lot of younger people out there who get credit cards for the first time and don't understand that there is interest attached to it.

They just don't they think it's like a debit card.

I'm borrowing money from myself.

I can pay back later.

It's like giving myself alone.

They don't understand until they finally after months and months and months.

Their credit card is shut down and they get a bill and they're they owed twice what they spent because the interest started going up.

That is not a joke.

That is a massive thing that happens.

Okay, this is true.

Okay, this is that is a true thing that happens.

It may be uncomfortable.

Okay.

All right.

What else we got here?

I don't know Superman was able to fix the Rokana channel and discord guys.

Don't forget Rokana is going to be here on Monday.

Okay on stream around noon.

So I'm going to go.

I'm going to be asking them a set of questions again for like 30 to 45 minutes.

So if you have any questions you would like for me to ask obviously I'm not going to ask your stupid ones related to congressional stuff oversight budgeting, you know inside, you know,

congressional insider trading even maybe Epstein list stuff since he's the co-sponsor of the bill.

We'll talk about it.

So make sure that you that you're here for that.

Okay.

All right.

Let's see what else we got here.

Welcome MNTLXX to the bear gang.

All right.

What is this?

Okay, here we go.

If so, I think you should continue to hold or take calls.

Okay, because of what because of this am I in stub like stub hub?

Yes.

Oh Lord have mercy hands off.

Okay.

How she wiped though?

Oh my God.

I'm not reading these out loud.

No.

Okay.

All right.

You guys need help.

All right.

Let's open it up.

This is why we need to raise rates stocky.

What are your thoughts on this?

This is a video or picture today.

I'm flying to Kuwait as usual.

I'm running late.

So I take my husband's car to the airport.

Here we go.

Okay.

All right.

Well, here we go.

We got some Middle Eastern money.

All right.

I'm taking my husband's Bugatti.

Okay, but then this happened.

I left the car on the side of the road and I got the driver to pick me up.

Maybe we left your car.

It's fine.

I have a one-hour flight.

So I get my hair done and breakfast on the way as soon as I land.

I get my makeup done and have the first two today.

I have collaborations with the clinic.

Salons and makeup brand Kuwait is one of my favorite places.

It's like one of those day in the life of for somebody but for them.

It's just a it's an amazing place with a lot of opportunity for women in business.

But the best part about Kuwait Kuwaiti food, but in a traditional way.

Then business done.

I meet up with my sister.

It's like you guys know what poverty tourism is.

You guys have heard of poverty tourism, right?

Where people with money?

We'll go to poverty-stricken areas to see how they live and live like them.

That was what that Kuwaiti thing was the food thing this stream.

Fuck you just in the mall took some pictures with my fans.

Any very long day with my fans going back home by guys.

Hopefully you enjoyed the longest day of my today.

She got a trunk though.

All right.

Well, I don't I listen their money is different in different places.

Somebody who is somebody who lives.

In for example in in in rural India looks at your like low like if your middle class life the same way that you're looking at this person, so I guess it's all about perspective.

Like I'm not even I'm not even like SC you know three just resubbed for two months giving anybody a pass but it's so funny how we see that.

You know what I mean?

Like everyone's you know perspective is so different.

It's just weird.

Just think about that.

If you did like a day in your life.

There are people that does that mean a Qatari military will have a troops on the ground in the USA.

What I don't know what you're talking about.

You sent me another one to guys.

I can't do these fucking day in the life shits all day.

This doesn't even make any sense.

What is this?

How much just a girl how much I spend living in Miami God Jesus.

She said I thought she was wearing pants.

Never mind how much I spend living in Miami how much it actually cost being a girl living in Miami.

Oh, here we go.

All right.

I spend being a girl living in Miami.

My rent is 13,000 and but my man pays for it.

So it's free.

Oh, we're going to get through this together guys.

We can get through this together.

Okay, I have three gym memberships.

I don't know why but my man pays for two of them.

The other one is $200 a month for my Pilates classes, which I always schedule and forget to show up to obviously body contouring because we need to be invisible.

And what is this thing with people just taking a fucking rolling pin and rubbing it on their stomach?

This reminds me and I'm guilty of buying one of these when I was like a teenager there was this there was this contraption used to buy it was this this contraption used to buy and it was a shocker and it was that you would oh God, maybe not now.

It doesn't matter.

So what you would do is is you would you would put this belt thing on your stomach and it would have like six different little metal things and you would you would you would put it on there and it would send little electric shocks to each of your abs and it was supposed to.

To stimulate them to make the muscle stronger and it would give you abs.

It was such a stupid fucking thing, but everyone believed it.

Is that what we're doing here?

We're just rubbing.

We're just like damaging skin cells or say, what are we doing?

What is this?

Okay, this is just like a very like strong massage.

This is like getting some like some Eastern European fucking, you know Farmer to give you a fucking deep tissue massage with his fucking leathery hands.

You know what I mean?

Like I don't I don't get what this is.

That's about $800 a month.

I take peptides and supplements and that's around $833 a month.

Just eat a fucking salad.

Jesus Christ, the amount of people that's been a thousand dollars a month on fucking supplements could just eat a goddamn salad.

Like eat some fucking carrots, some broccoli, maybe some fucking asparagus, some green beans, some beets.

Maybe I don't know man, like some lima beans.

Like what are you doing, man?

Just go out to go to the fucking Farmers Market.

Get some goddamn vegetables.

You ain't got to buy.

You ain't got to take all these supplements.

Like what are we doing guys?

Why?

Beets and meat.

Shut up, Daniela.

Like I don't even get it.

Okay, you know, it's like, well, I don't have time to make all that.

Well, then get a fucking juicer, throw it in there and fucking juice it up.

Hold your breath and drink it.

The same thing you do when you take fucking fucking fireball shots on the weekend.

Oh, I'm so healthy with my body.

That weekend is Jager bombs.

This is so crazy.

Tomorrow morning.

We're doing mimosas.

Then we're doing margaritas and then

tequila shots.

Crazy like shut the fuck up.

Okay.

What are you talking about?

All right, mix the fucking fucking juice in your fucking tequila and take a shot of it.

Okay, like like like literally that's all you've got to do.

Like what are you doing a thousand dollars?

Have you all never heard of fucking vegetables?

I don't get it.

I need zinc.

All right, eat some fucking eat some eat some fucking, you know,

spinach.

Yeah, but I also need some magnesium.

Okay.

We'll just eat some fucking like almonds or some shit, but I also need calcium.

Okay.

Well, there's almonds.

Well, I also I also need potassium you heard of a banana.

Well, yeah, but what about my folic acid?

There's like 80 vegetable like just just fucking make a juicer.

I'm sorry.

I'm blacking out over people getting supplements.

I just don't get it.

Thank you for doing this.

It's a distraction from my bleeding of my portfolio.

I'm sorry.

And you're not a girl.

Living.

In Miami.

If you don't take hot girl.

What the fuck is a hot girl?

Walk box, which is a four-mile walk where you think about three things.

What the fuck?

What the fuck is a hot girl?

Why is he viral?

Go for a walk.

There's a focus on positive self-ambition goals and gratitude.

I'm going to leave in a few minutes.

Do you have to be hot to take a hot girl walk?

Or is it like hot yoga?

It has to be hot outside.

All right, babe, since you're hot.

Huh?

You're not hot.

What are you sexy?

What do you want me to call you?

You need to start taking a hot girl walk.

Okay, hot girl.

Walk is an outdoor walk for four miles.

You focus on internal thoughts and positive affirmations not physical appearance gratitude goals.

And confidence good things willingly.

Don't I know that I wish my wife forfeited her ass a little bit more willing.

You can make it five miles.

I won't mind.

Hey, we should round up women against their against their will tie them to fucking tables and read them against their I'm not going to do this context thing every day.

All right, I learned something today.

She doesn't look like she's thinking about internal instead of external like whatever just free.

I mean unless I stopped to get like a matcha or coffee $300 cough, which is always.

So that ends up being $300 a month and then obviously food because even though we always serve we still have to eat but that's $2,000 a month.

We always serve what fuck I feed six people in this house for a thousand dollars a month because I go through a meal prep service.

I get my nails done at least twice a month, which is three.

She could save a lot of money.

I'm not sponsored anymore hundred dollars.

I recommend buying class pass because you get really good deals on there.

My shopping budget is $5,000 a month.

What do you do with all?

That shit you live in an apartment.

You're spending 5,000 a month on shopping.

What the fuck you do with all that when my man is being cheap, but it's whatever I usually end up spending more hair and makeup for date nights.

That's usually around.

I'm gonna be real with you.

I'm not like I'm not talking about physical appearance.

I'm just saying based on her personality.

She got it.

There's something she's doing.

I don't want to say it out loud, but it definitely there's something that she's doing that.

That is keeping this get this around because $200 a month and then lastly bottle service, but I just pay with my face card and that's how much it costs being a girl living in Miami.

If you're looking to move here, that's how much it costs you having your side piece that lives in Miami for her silence.

I'm sorry.

I'm not being a dick.

I'm not being a dick, but that's what it costs.

That is what you pay for the silence.

Okay, that's why when your neighbor okay when you're when the neighbors when their family.

All of a sudden buys the babysitter a fucking brand new car, right?

Let me tell you something that that's not because they're thanking the babysitter, you know, you know, whatever.

I mean, you know, I would love to be your guide.

Okay, I can't I don't know what to tell you here.

I'm not I'm still stuck up on the hot girl walk thing.

Can guys take hot girl walks hot guy walks, but if we said hot guy walk, we would get called misogynistic and like self-centered.

So we can't do that.

All right.

Um, okay.

I have no idea what this has to do with since we're talking about books and libraries earlier.

What does that have to do with anything?

But you can't trust the New Berlin Public Library to give you access or free to hundreds of books.

Great programming and resources.

You can't trust everybody, but you can't trust the New Berlin Public Library to give you access or free.

Oh, no.

Great programming and resources.

Oh, no.

No.

You can't trust everybody, but you can't trust the New Berlin Public Library.

Oh, that's great.

Oh, that's great.

That's how that's how marketing should be done.

Oh, man.

That's absolutely insane.

Thank you.

Thank you.

You access for free to hundreds of books.

Great programming and resources.

But you can't trust the New Berlin Public Library to give you access for free to hundreds of books.

Oh, no.

Great programming and resources.

All kinds of programming ideas and resources.

Oh, that's good.

All right, I'm almost done here.

I'm just going through the list of things that you guys have sent me.

I know we're not doing stock right now but it's Friday.

What is this?

what is this record high gold record high has prices record high.

household debt record high Interest rate cuts.

Oh, yeah.

Could this in badly pay paid too much debt and overvalued assets though?

What's just the historically things to be?

what's just the historically things to be?

Yeah.

Oh, it's an ad for somebody else.

Okay, that's fair.

Did you just send me somebody's ad?

I need a month-long YOLO.

Funny enough, I actually took the Fed not cutting interest rates this next month as my YOLO.

I know it's almost impossible, but they said they're going to do two interest rate cuts by the end of the year.

And most people think the second, two more with three months to go.

Everybody thinks that this month is going to be the next one, and they probably will.

But it's like 9.1 to .9, almost 9 to 1 odds that they'll do.

They won't do it.

They'll just keep it no change this month.

So I was like, fuck it.

That's why not, right?

All right, I'll do one more and then see if there's anything else.

And then I got to get going because I got to pick up my daughter.

We're up on a lot of shit today, though.

CatX is still, those of you guys still in there.

NVX has absolutely crushed it.

UU is crushing it.

Our divvies are holding up pretty well.

We did pretty well considering the market's getting absolutely fucking like shit on right now.

That's why I've got to buy my calls before the end of the day for the weekend.

You're up a nickel on max?

Well, bro.

Listen, let me tell you something right now.

If you don't own max, you're a fucking bitch.

I don't make the rules.

All right, what's this?

All right.

First check-in I've done in a very long time.

It's not going to be a good one.

Today is Thursday, July 17th, 2025.

And I am sitting in the most amount of drawdown that I've ever been in.

July?

July 17th.

That's right here.

What the fuck?

How are you?

That was a new all-time high.

What?

I tried.

I traded 40 contracts.

An amount that I've traded before.

But the difference between this time and the last time is I broke my rules this time.

The last time I traded with 40 contracts, I took my loss.

It is what it is.

It was my biggest loss.

I think it was $28,000 or $27,000.

And that was it.

That was my first time experimenting with 40 contracts.

I tried it again this time.

But this time I broke my rules.

And I couldn't solidify my loss.

And I didn't want to solidify my loss.

And I held.

And now we're sitting...

I'm sitting in $200,000 worth of drawdown.

With the potential for this to keep going.

That hurts.

Before any of y'all judge, I want you to look at a position that was a day trade once that you held.

And didn't sell it because it was a loss or it was down for the day.

And you said, I'll just hold it overnight.

And you held it overnight and then it dropped down the next day 5% to your side.

I'm going to buy a little bit more for the bounce back.

And it didn't.

And then it kept falling and you kept buying and kept buying.

And you have so much goddamn capital in it now.

And you still can't let it go.

And it's still red in your portfolio.

You just can't let it go.

So before you fucking judge this woman, I know you're out there too.

Okay?

You mean like MNTS?

MNTS?

Alright motherfuckers, I'll see y'all in a month.

Just to add insult to injury.

So I'll get scalded on the internet.

I'm bummed.

I broke my rules, man.

Paying the price, literally.

That is all the work I put in this year.

Oof.

Dissolved in one trade.

Oof.

Crazy.

I was at $200.

For half the year.

Coming into July.

$200,000 worth of profits.

I took some losses.

Even had my biggest loss.

Here's the problem though.

And this is why it's dangerous for this girl.

Notice how she says,

I haven't cut it at $200,000 loss.

I broke my rules.

I'm now down $200,000 with the potential for more.

You are now break even on the year.

Fuck it.

You fucked up.

You said you weren't going to do it again.

You did it again.

Maybe.

The second time's a charm.

You're done.

Cut it.

Fucking cut it.

Done.

Cut it.

Continued to go down more.

But still was doing really well.

Still abiding by my rules.

Even though I was experimenting with bigger contract sizes and bigger positions.

I made a mistake, but I'm going to keep making it.

Like y'all said, never stick your dick in crazy, but you keep going back.

This time, broke the rules, man.

Or ladies, you know who you got on that roster and you're not supposed to text him again?

You're supposed to delete his number, but you just renamed him to like Pizza Hut.

Some shit.

Mm.

All right.

First check in.

I'm done.

That's rough.

But I'll be honest with you.

I don't know what happens, but the market, if she was long the market, she probably did good.

You know, what's crazy.

I have a feeling.

I don't know who this is.

Never seen it before, but I have a feeling she probably stayed in this, got her money back or maybe even profited.

And that's the worst fucking thing that could happen to her.

The worst fucking thing.

I don't know.

Does she have a page I could check?

If she stayed in that and it came back and it actually worked out, that's actually the worst fucking thing she could have ever done.

Because instead of learning something from it, it reinforces that, well, next time, maybe I'll do it again.

I just timed it bad.

She got out of the trade up 90,000.

Oh, no.

Wait.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Really?

Oh, she sells a course.

Okay.

Okay.

Not saying anything about that right now because I don't want to get into the fucking.

My wife told me not to get any more beef right now until after TwitchCon.

Today is Wednesday, July 30th, 2025.

Well, currently, I'm in my trade.

So I've been patient and drawdown.

I got to be patient.

Okay.

I'm not going to do all this right now.

I'll talk about it.

I don't want to encourage anybody.

Speaking of which, I'm going to try futures trading for the first time ever in a couple weeks.

Some company reached out to me that does, they do a futures trading thing and they do like one of those, whatever.

And I was like,

yeah, I'll, I'll, I want to give it a shot.

I'll give it a shot.

Fuck it.

What are it?

And, um, it's one of those demo accounts that like, you know, if you do well, whatever, you know, you can, you can eventually use real money, whatever.

And they, I talked to them.

They seem like a pretty, pretty fucking good company, pretty good, legit people.

And I, and I see their track record, but that's not why I wanted to do it.

It's because I've never tried futures trading and everybody says my lines always seem to work.

And I'm like, well, I'm going to give it a shot for real.

So we'll see.

You're doing a prop firm.

No, not exactly.

Not exactly.

I don't do prop firms.

It's a little bit different than that.

Interactive brokers.

Aren't you options trading the future?

Well, yes and no.

Um, it's more so.

I just want to kind of like, I've never done it before.

And you know, when you don't know something, you want to give it a shot.

And I was going to, I wanted to practice on my own, but they're like, Hey, you want to do it?

I was like, all right, I'll give it a shot.

Um, just, just for a little bit, just for, just for fun and see if I'm any good at it.

I'm probably going to fail at it miserably.

And you guys are going to watch me do that.

We ride down 16%.

No, it's not a signal service.

Beginning of the end.

No, it's not.

No, you guys, those of you guys that get all angry about this shit, that's fine.

I don't care.

I'm not, if you, if you know who I am and what I do, you'll know that I've vetted this

completely, but you can, you can have your judgments.

I don't care.

It's up to you.

I still want to have fun.

Uh, I completed a mild victory.

I was able to create 627 X leverage on zero date.

What the fuck?

Oh shit.

I got to go.

Fuck.

I'm going to, I'm going to forget.

I'm not gonna be able to pick up my daughter in time.

Okay.

I got to go.

I got to go.

I got to go.

I got to go.

I got to go.

I got to go.

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

Uh, somebody give me somebody.

Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

You're supposed to leave 22 minutes ago.

I know, I know, I know, I know.

Hurry, hurry, hurry.

Just give me somebody.

Anybody.

I don't care.

I got to go.

Kid Boga.

Fuck that guy.

I'm just kidding.

Kid's fine.

Why do you guys always give me the same fucking people over and over again?

It's like, I like, I don't mind doing that, but Jesus Christ.

All right, I'm out.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's get naked.

I got to go all the way to pick up my daughter.

Come back.

Also, I got a pile of fucking outfits.

I got to, I don't know what I'm going to do with all these outfits.

I've bought too many.

All right, let's get naked.

Wait, wait, wait.

Are you taking anything over the weekend?

Oh, yeah.

I'm taking calls on, I have my AMAC calls.

Um, and, uh, I don't know, man.

I'm thinking about SoFi.

I don't know.

We'll see.

We'll see.

We'll see.

I, I, I don't think about it right now.

I got to go.

Remember guys, Ro Khanna is going to be here on Monday.

So if, uh, we have a channel in there, if you, um, if you want to go to Ro Khanna,

if you want to add, put questions in there, put them in the Ro Khanna questions channel

and I'll vet them before he comes on, on, uh, Monday.

You're going to be one.

You're going to want to be here for that.

Okay.

Should be around noon, about 30 or 40 minutes.

All right.

Remember guys, become an Oregon donor.

It's the greatest gift you could give.

It doesn't cost you a thing.

That's number one.

Number two, if there's somebody who loves you and misses you and talking about it, give

them a call.

Give them a text.

Send them an email.

Send them a carrier pigeon.

Let them know you think about them.

You could really make somebody's day.

But more importantly, go make your own day.

You got the rest of it.

Make the best of it.

And remember, as long as you got two healthy kidneys, you are not broke.

Otherwise, I will see you guys on Monday.

Hasta luego.

Hasta lunes, mi amigos, mi familia, cabrones, pandillas y todo.

Gracias por todo.

Remember guys, short stream next week.

I'm leaving on Thursday for TwitchCon.

I'll see you guys there.

Um, thank you for supporting the stream and being here and let me hang out with you.

You guys are fucking awesome.

Uh, and, uh, thanks for, uh, letting me keep this as my job.

And, uh, keep giving me your money, you fucking, fucking simp bitches.

I'm fucking with you.

I love you.

Uh, take care of yourselves.

Tell your mom I said hi.

She got a fat ass.

And, uh, hey.

Hey.

Buy the dip, bitch.

I'll see you guys next week.

Go fuck yourselves.

Tell your mom I said hi.

She got a fat ass.

And as always, stay green, you D-gens.

Bye.

Eat a salad.

Quit spending money on fucking pills, you fucking pill-popping drug addicts.
