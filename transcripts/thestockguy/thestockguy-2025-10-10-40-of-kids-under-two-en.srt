Well, hello, good morning. How are you? What is up?

How's it going? What day is it guys? What day is it? You know what day it is.

Rebecca, remind us what day it is.

It's my friends, looking in the front seat, looking in the back seat.

Fried, yeah! Looking forward to the weekend.

We are German on the highway.

Yeah, hello, hello, van. We are having so much fun.

Are you having fun? Let's see if Disney has a good day.

I think Disney's gonna have a good day, but we shall see.

Alright, let's run it.

Thank you for MNTS yesterday. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Give it a day or two, okay, asshole?

Yeah.

Disney zero day 112 call? Ooh, imagine. Imagine.

That's right. If you forgot when Sunday comes,

that's when you're gonna have a good day.

That's when you're gonna have a good day.

That's when it comes.

So chilling in the front seat.

I have to roll my Verizon calls. I'm getting killed.

Ooh, the dancing alien's back.

Verizon is now run by the PayPal CEO?

Yeah, I know. It's like, it's like, it's come back to haunt me.

What did Simba say to the driver?

I don't know.

Here it comes.

Mufasa? Oh God, get the fuck out.

You know what? Hold on.

Alright, that's it. I'm un-VIPing all the women,

so I don't have to see what they say anymore.

Shut up, techno-queef of Tesla.

Alright, ding, ding.

Ding, ding, ding. We are live.

Alright, so we got a few things running right now.

For those of you guys that are degents,

we're gonna go ahead and pop right on in.

We've got, hold on.

Let's just check our Joby calls we took yesterday.

Those are looking good.

Shit, I gotta sell a lot of things. Hold on.

Come Congress cannot figure out how to pass AI regulations

or cryptocurrency regulation.

Can't figure out or refuse to figure it out?

Big difference there.

Alright, so let's go ahead and look at what we got here.

We've got a few things moving.

We've got Kodak looking good.

We've got Pton up.

We've got Mir back up.

We've got Fly at 420 now.

NNDM looking really good.

Hut pushing for 50.

Dude, I think I'm up 600% on...

I'm gonna sell my NNDM calls.

I think I'm up 600% on those shares now.

We've also got a lot moving.

All of our shares are moving.

All of our shares are moving.

Over here as well.

Let's go ahead and look at what we've got here.

I am in CatX this morning, which is flying.

I'm also in Orbs, which absolutely went insane.

And I'm hoping it has another run here.

AMAT is the main one I'm focusing on today.

And then Disney as well.

And Disney's already moving.

These are because of the news that we talked about.

Disney charging more for their parks now.

And we've got AMAT with more China curbs potentially going to be

one that people are jumping into.

Also jumped into Doximity this morning.

They got downgraded and fell pretty hard.

They're about 3% right now.

So I'm gonna go ahead and put my trailing stop loss at 1% on these

and be done with it.

Let's see, trailing stop loss on Doximity.

Let's go ahead and show the percent one.

That was a nice little catch there.

CatX is still moving.

This is my main play today.

It's a little bit different than what I usually play.

But I'm up about 6% right now.

So I'm gonna go ahead and put a total stop loss of this of 5%.

Normally I would tier this, but it's a little bit volatile.

So I'm just gonna put this here.

This is off of an initiation that they got,

which was pretty wild.

And then my other main play is Orbs.

This is one that had some pretty big news

and a recent investment from BMNR.

So this went up.

I'm up about 5% on it right now.

I'm gonna go ahead and put a 7% trailing stop loss on that.

And those are the three that I am in from pre-market.

And keeping a very close eye on Disney and AMAT today.

And already stopped out of docks.

That's cool.

AMAT right there. Disney coming back down.

QQQ's still going for record highs.

Let's see what we got.

Wow.

Verizon really fucking reversed there, huh?

Alright.

CatX moving up again.

Are you still holding MNTS?

Yes. Why? I haven't looked at my portfolio this morning.

I think Disney's gonna be a surprise one today.

I wanna be very careful with it, but I think it's a surprise day today.

Wow. Verizon, what a fucking

rebound that was from this morning.

Holy shit.

Let's see what happens here.

I have to roll these calls.

It's gonna rebound very, very, very sharply.

But I think it might take a little while.

As a dad of a young kid,

everyone who's going to Disney, price be damned.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

Absolutely.

There's no question that people are gonna...

I mean, I was actually surprised.

I've been doing this a long time. I was surprised to know how much

of their revenue actually comes from...

Ooh, I could get my next leg in on Poet.

How much of their revenue actually comes

from parks.

You'd think it wouldn't be as much as it was.

It just was insane.

Alright, SoFi is now

$29, ladies and gentlemen.

We are now up 170%

on that. Of course, it would be much more

if we didn't average up. Hive, we are now up

200% on Hive after

being down on that for so long.

NVX, this run, we're up 60%.

NNE, great

bounce back

from under 27.

TSSI, this is the new

one that we're getting in for AI and

data centers that we think is

next on the docket. Up 15%

on those shares. So we

had a nice one there. Walmart, nice bounce back here.

We got MLTX going again.

We got a lot. But NVX

back to 252, guys. This is the one

that my fellow graphite barons

that we've been in this for a long time. Our hut

shares are about 600% now.

Dpro hit almost $15

this morning, which is absolutely

wild. UUU,

$21 insane run that we've

been in on this one. Oshkosh, we got

in because of the

private garbage

trucks for rich people

a while back. I think we're up about 75%

on that. And so everything

is looking really nice. Boeing bouncing back here. Gilt

going for $14.50 again.

Alright, let's see what we got

moving right now.

Oh shit, I got stopped out of orbs.

No! No! No!

No! Don't do that to me!

Fuck! Alright, I'm going to put a buy

order back the same place I had it earlier

and see if I get filled again.

Are you selling any UUU?

No, I think, I told you yesterday, I think

that even though UUU is absolutely

in, oh my, oh my, oh shit, my

Levi puts. Oh god, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot,

I forgot. Oh no!

You know what's crazy? Yesterday

on stream, I said I was going to take puts for Levi through earnings

and I had 15 of them.

I put a buy order for 5 more and I hit

sell order. So I only have 10 left.

What are you talking about?

When the doctor was sewing you up, I said, hey,

hey, don't sew it, you know, don't sew

it all the way closed. He goes, why? I said,

it's fourth whole Friday, doc.

Oh my god.

This is my legacy.

Alright, Hive now.

At 760, guys, we are now

up 200 and

5% on those.

Do NVX

another 16% now.

CatX, we're still in,

moving really nicely. And TSSI up 3.5%.

2027 $10

Poet leaps. I did a whole whiteboard yesterday

on why Poet is probably not

going to have the same kind of move

as Opendoor. It's too diluted

with buyers right now.

But that being said, I still think that

we're in that, remember that downswing cycle where

there's going to be liquidity coming in if it happens?

And that's why I'm legging in right now.

But I'm not going to be keeping this. There goes Amat.

That was our main focus for...

Am I going to get bailed out a third time?

I got bailed out on Amazon

and Joby.

Am I going to get bailed out on Verizon?

Oh, speaking of which,

okay. What are we doing with these

Kodak leaps? I don't fucking know.

You took Disney

Zero Day Calls? You fucking...

Are you okay?

Stocky needs to be studied? What the fuck?

NVX? What are you talking about

he needs to be studied? Bro, we

had to up and down trade this shit

for, um...

for like a year almost.

Amish Bobbink just resubbed for

32 months. Target needs to go?

I'm out of Target already. What's the deal

with CatX?

So...

Morning Call is open on Friday.

So if you want to go to Friday Freebies,

you can hear the recording about why I took

CatX. It was literally

just a crazy initiation.

That's the only thing that made

me take it. Actually, it's a toe for YOLO today.

So that's why I

took it. It wasn't even like a main play.

Orbs was my main play because of the news.

And I didn't sell it pre-market when I was up

14%, so I only got like 5.5%

out of it. I have another buy order

for this again. I know it's up 25%, but

this is the type of play or type of

stock that

could really, you know,

take off again. Just because even though it's up

25%, the whole thing is

is that they launched a new pilot

program for their advanced AI

authentication programs. And

this is a month after BM&R,

which is insane right now. The whole

idea behind BM&R is insane.

BM&R actually invested $20 million

into them as well. So they've got a couple catalysts.

And so, that's why

I really like this. I'm

waiting for it to come down before I buy again. If I

miss a second run, I miss a second run.

Amat, I said, was my favorite one today. Just

because of the China Curves and Disney because of

the Park News.

That's kind of the ones I'm focusing on today.

Oh shit, I got confirmation that Rokhan

is going to be here at 12 on Monday

for 30 to 45 minutes.

Thanks for the UUUU signal,

Stocky. Easy 50%. Okay,

buddy. So what I'm going to do is

I'm going to open up our channel in Discord.

I get him for a good period

of time, actually.

So I get a sitting, another sitting

congressperson.

On the stream for 30 to 45

minutes. And we've already discussed

other than like very specific

things that we don't really want to bring up because

it's just, we've hashed out already.

It's pretty much an open forum. So

I'm basically going to talk to him

about, what I told him

I want to talk to him about is

congressional stock

trading,

the budget,

things about the budget, like what's going on,

how do you guys figure this out,

what do you think, ideas on how they come to

sit in terms. I might slip in the

Epstein thing. You think I should ask

about the Epstein thing? Since he co-sponsored

the bill? I really don't want

to get too much into the APAC thing, like

I don't mind touching on it,

but I feel like that's more of a

you know, if you start

talking about that outside of just like

one big special interest

group, it starts to come across as you've got like

an agenda, and I don't really

want that to come across. So I don't mind bringing that up, but like

deep diving into that, that's like not my

you know, using a

APAC and others as an example of like, okay

these special interest groups and how much influence

they have is fine, but like I think some people

would want me to go way deeper into that, and that's

not the content I do.

Afraid of what? You think I'm afraid of

anything? No, I'm not afraid. It's about

the brand. You don't go off brand.

Alright, so what I'm going to do

is I'm going to go into Discord, and I'm going to go into

the, where it says Sue

Ennis. I'm going to change that to Ro Khanna.

I hope I don't mess it up, and I'm going to

let you guys put questions in there today

and in the weekend, and I'm going to

pick from there for some questions from you guys.

Okay, here we go.

I guess verified?

Oh, whoops, I should have taken it. I don't know.

What do I do? I'm going to fuck this up, aren't I?

I'm going to have to have a mod fix

the channel.

Can you use this for your Twitter announcement?

Alright, we got stopped out of CatX.

Nice little play there too.

So we got two out-the-gate morning plays

this morning. I'd like,

we got stopped out of Doximity, so we had three Ws this

morning. I'm looking to get back into Ouroboros.

I'm really deciding if I want to jump

in on AMAT or Disney today.

I feel like Disney's a better catalyst.

I know that that's stupid

because Disney's such a shit stock, but

the last time they announced

price increases, they really had a jump.

Alright.

For those of you guys who were at the end of stream

yesterday,

the

last thing that

we did was we jumped into

NNE when it hit 4580

and we took shares and

calls. We are up 55%

on those calls, so I'm going to sell those now.

And we have a stop loss on the shares that we took.

That was our little end of day

trade. Still on Amazon

calls? I actually bought Amazon calls

yesterday morning and

it was

wild because I bought

four of them

when it went to a dollar.

And then, or six of

them, sorry. And so I

sold some and then now

I shouldn't be, you know,

I shouldn't be playing the same positions

because it's so dangerous now.

But I wish I would have doubled down

on it because it's

65% now on them.

It topped out at 175. Yeah, I got out at

like 129 on half of them

and then I got these left over.

I'm going to clear these completely. Although I think Amazon

has a chance for another bounce back.

I don't want to hold anything short dated over the weekend.

Oh man, this is really

ugh, this is tempting.

Okay, my buy order keeps

not filling and it's right there. So I think

I think I'm just going to

buy here and then just set

another buy because

this is, I'm waiting too long here.

Okay. Alright, AMAT

looks healthy here. Other one that we wanted to

look at after open today

was

BABA. BABA's had

six straight losing sessions now. Might be

a weekend play. FIG partnering with Google.

Wendy's launching a

turnaround initiative. Fuck, Disney's

going to go, isn't it? Why do you have an

L counter maliciously hiding your degen picks?

I love how you guys

think that everything I do is like

intentional on purpose, yet you watch me

every day and realize that I barely can

turn on my computer. Like you think that

I'm intentionally hiding

or maybe I just moved the fucking

thing up and forgot to put it back. Like

maybe, you know,

it's like looking at your

grandfather arguing with the fucking

cable company on the phone and being like

he's having flashbacks and

nom, he's plotting on killing that customer

service. Or maybe he's just like, I'm

I remember when he thought you could talk to a

goddamn human being instead of a fucking

machine and then getting routed to some

goddamn fucking

Middle Eastern, you know, whatever and then

and then now I got a fucking AI and shit

like I miss times when I could just

drink and fucking, you know, beat my wife

and I could live off of

a single goddamn income and you know

like, no. Okay, it's not always

the same thing that you're thinking, alright?

Alright. Alright, we're out

of half of our Levi puts that we took through earnings

um

let's see what else we got. All in on Disney

Zero Day. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't, no

that's not, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Okay. Alright, back in

orbs, um, instead of a

stop loss, what I'm doing is, is I just put

half position here and I have another um

and I'm just gonna, where my stop loss would be, I just have

the other half, uh, to buy. So it's either

moons here and I make money or it falls and I get

filled and then I put a stop loss in. There goes Disney, god damn it.

And there goes AMET. Son of a bitch, I'm sitting here

fucking being indecisive as a

little shithead. Hegseth

is speaking? Oh god. Alright,

I'm gonna add one more AEHR call.

Can you talk about Levi? They met

earnings but cited tariffs and went down. Yeah,

so after what, uh, AEHR did, citing

tariffs and getting there, uh, I was in Levi

Puts. I was actually down on Levi Puts.

I was already in Levi Puts before yesterday, uh,

and it was because I was worried that Trump might

say something about, um, about

um, uh, you know,

additional tariffs over in, uh,

uh, somewhere, you know, in Asia,

uh, even if it was Vietnam or whatnot.

And so it didn't happen, uh,

but I was also watching American Eagle and others and I was like,

man, Levi, I wonder if, you know, how this is gonna play out.

Doesn't matter. Uh, with, uh, with

the way that, uh, AEHR

talked about potential, uh, impacts of

tariffs, again, it made me think that Levi

might talk about them as well, uh,

and, and, and lower their guidance potentially,

uh, or give some kind of cautionary

tale, and so that's why I took them.

Uh, and so people are still

worried because this isn't AI,

this isn't the same sector. It's, it's

much different. It's much different. You're talking about the

retail sector. And while

corporations are eating about

55% of the tariffs right now,

and consumers are only eating about 14%

of it, uh, it's only sustained for so long.

Plus, Levi got a huge bulk of their inventory

pre, um, uh,

pre-tariffs, so they have the

inventory, but they're running, they're gonna run out of that inventory

and they're gonna have to buy and they're gonna have to pay for it.

So, these corporations, especially on the retail

side, are saying, hey, you know,

this is going to be a concern. If, if these

tariffs don't get lifted or get dropped soon,

we can no longer eat these tariffs,

you know, this cost,

without passing it on to the customer, and we're

running out of our inventory that we bought.

So, we're gonna have to purchase and we're gonna

have to pass the cost on, and that's gonna hurt our bottom

line. And so, you know,

that's kind of the worry that they're having.

Alright. Got dry powder

for the weekend. Joby calls

are coming back a little bit here. Um,

Rivian bouncing

up a little bit here. We got Kodak up a little bit.

Mir coming back as well.

I took Helen of Troy yesterday. I don't

know if that was a smart decision or not yet. We're gonna

find out. Not going crazy on

anything, though. Yeah, I have to, I have to

roll my Verizon

calls. I still think Verizon's gonna

bounce back nicely, but I think it's just gonna take

a little bit longer than I expected.

Alright. So, NVX is up

23%. What in God's

name? SoFi

going for $23.30. NNE

$49. TSSI, our

new play, doing pretty well. Walmart up 1%

today. Joby up 1%.

We've got

Dpro was at almost $15

this morning. It's at $14 right now. We're up

199% on that.

On the third run. So, in the past six

months, we've played Dpro for

137%, 100%, and now

200%. So, that was really nice

there.

Plug back to $3.80. Alts

a little bit of a gain back.

Rivian up about a quarter

percent. We're back in orbs.

WeRiot holding on. UUU

up another 8%.

Ford is green. What's

red? Poet, but we grabbed some more

at $8.18.

Gilt is red. Aerie is red.

MLGO is red.

It's back under $10. NVO is red, but it's still at

$58. Celsius red, down

to $63. So, we're only up, what,

180% now.

GUR is red.

I think I'm going to jump back. I'm going to play a little bit of

GPUS here. Okay.

What are you rolling your Verizon to?

I haven't decided yet.

By end of day, I want

to roll them. I think I'm going to roll them

to...

I mean, the March $45 calls are pretty

cheap. $46 is ridiculous.

Ridiculously cheap. I'm going to do it by end of day,

though. I still think Verizon...

Again, what I think doesn't matter, but

I still think that Verizon is going to bounce

back. It

bounces back pretty hard whenever it falls like

this, and a lot of it has... I mean, obviously, you're

coming up on Divi date right now, so people are going to be

selling because they got their ex-Divi.

But the new CEO,

big change, it's PayPal CEO, which PayPal

hurt me years ago, even though it was one of my best

all-time plays, and I just

didn't sell it. I think that was...

No matter how long you're doing this,

no matter how long you're in the market, the market always

changes, the economy always changes, things change,

and you have to adapt, and you're going to learn

lessons, and I had to learn a new lesson

there. I had to...

Not really a new lesson, but be reminded

that if you're going to own

something, you have to babysit it, and you have

to be very honest with

yourself if you see something changing for the

negative instead of trying to grasp for the positive,

and that's something I learned.

I got into it with COVID. We thought that with

Square and all

the merchant-based payment systems that nobody was

going out to restaurants or stores anymore. Everybody was locked

down or locked up in their house,

and so they were going to have to purchase things online, and

PayPal was going to be that one, and we were right.

We fucking nailed it. I mean, the stock went from 100 to

300, but then everyone

else was like, all right, well, we can also add this feature

and do this feature, and it's like PayPal, instead of

being the one doing it, they're like, no, we're good. We'll sit

back and watch, and then I watched

as everyone else became the leader

in that sector and did

not sell for 200% or

150% or 100%,

ended up selling last year

for 70-something dollars

and took a fucking 30% loss on my shares.

That's on me. I mean, like,

you're going to do that, you know what I mean? It's just a reminder

that if you're going to own a sizable position

in a large company, you have to be

babysitting it. That's why I tell people it's

better to just own the total market than individual companies

because if you're going to own individual companies, you've got to babysit them.

Have you ever looked at IGC,

Potential Management for Alzheimer's Disease,

which could be the next big problem for

aging population?

Let's break that down. Have I ever looked at

IGC? It sounds familiar, but I've never

broke it down.

Management for Alzheimer's Disease. There is a lot of

companies that are dealing with doing stuff with Alzheimer's.

I remember when Gilead was doing it. They had the big

lead drug on that.

The next big problem for aging

population. It's already

a big problem, but

the next round

of people are going to be dealing

with a lot of other things too

because, you know, Alzheimer's

is hereditary and

it is affecting a lot of people and it's

oftentimes diagnosed way too

late, but

because it is something that affects so many people,

there is a big, you know, my grandfather

died of it. He died of it

and he was hiding it from

everybody for a while

and then by the time we realized it was so

rapid, it was just insane. I just watched

this man that was

a Marine in Vietnam.

He was a captain of homicide in

Miami-Dade. He was a cop down here for 30 years.

Then he wrote books and he was

just a strong guy. He was

a concert pianist, a

violinist. I mean, he just did it all.

He just did it all. He was a strong man, you know,

and then to just watch him,

the guy who remembered the dumbest facts

in the world and him and I would talk about baseball

and

war and history and whatever,

to watch him

just so rapidly just

forget little things and

then it was like

then like he would forget what he was talking about

and then he couldn't, you know, he couldn't

talk and then he just started saying things you don't understand.

Then he got scared and alone and then

next thing I know, you know, it was over

and it was insane.

It was insane to watch that happen

and so, you know, it's

one of those things where a lot of people, here's

the problem too with a lot

of people is that

they,

we tend to not

keep track of our family members

the more, the longer we're apart

from them and

you do a phone call, you

know, or text or whatever

and you meet every now and then and so

you don't really get to see the

change and they're always going to tell you

they're okay because they probably don't know

something's wrong with them or they don't want to worry you because

they don't want you to like stop your life on it

and then by the time, sometimes it's too late

so that's why with things like that it's like

always good to check on your family, keep up with them

not just, not out of guilt but because

you know, these things can happen and

by the time you realize it, you're like why didn't I know

sooner and so, you know, keep up with

those things, okay?

Buy more guilt? No, no.

No, I'm not going to get all fucking like it's a Friday, I'm not

going to get all like you need to do this and take care and call

your family and spend it but

yeah, think about that with your family sometimes

like I did that whole thing about how

the time you graduate and leave

home, you only, for the rest of your life

on average, you're only going to see your family 300

more days. From the time you

leave home at 18 until they pass

away, you get 300 days with them

and every year that goes by

that's 10 more days that you lost

when you're 19, you get

290 more days to see them

when you're 20, 280 days

to see them. 21, 270

days left. So,

think about that, okay?

That's why I tell you guys

don't put it off because

you don't realize it until the time is too short

okay?

I mean, unless your family sucks. My family

is, there we go, my family is unfortunately

always unsupportive and discouraging. They have

always labeled my mental illness a drug

addiction. Okay, I don't know

why I gotta tune in. I wasn't trying

to make you all depressed, man. You got me

crying in a casino right now?

Bro, no, that's not what I was doing. I was just

talking, man.

I'm just talking. Sometimes we need reminders,

bro. I'll be real with you right now.

I'm gonna say something that's gonna fuck with you even more.

If what I just said depressed

you, that means you know you're

doing something wrong. Fix it.

Call your family. Don't just

text them, okay? Older people like to

talk. They don't, they're not,

texting for them is new and it's cold.

If you're sad about

what I just said, then that means

you probably

feel guilty right now. I'm not trying to do things

out of guilt, but I'm just saying, like,

I'm just saying, like, you know, I come for

the stocks, I stay for the therapy. Motherfucker, I'm not a therapist.

What are you laughing at?

Your parents live with us.

I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about them.

This is why DJing

Friday sucks now? I'm so

sad I'm buying Disney Zero Days?

Guilt puts? Because I can

imagine a world where my loved ones are no longer with me.

Am I doing something wrong?

No, it just means that the world has

hurt you so much that you

automatically prepare and

are ready and assume

or at least, you know,

I wouldn't say whoever, but you

realize the inevitable

and you just have to

accept that that's an inevitability.

That's what that means.

That doesn't make you a bad person, that just means

that the world is too

real for you, alright?

Okay, we're done here. Alright, we got our second fill

here. Alright, now it's time to start

putting my stop losses in.

Alright, we're still up on the day because we had a great play earlier.

So I'm gonna go ahead and put half of it at a

4% trailing stop loss.

And half of it is

7%.

I know those are pretty wide stop losses, but it really is

only a 5% or

a 5.5% stop loss.

Very volatile.

Alright, Hive back at 770.

NVX still going. What a fucking

play this has been, huh? NNE

5%. Of course I fucking sold

those NNE calls early.

Good pick up yesterday though. Two times now.

Where did I sell them at?

Just cause I like to feel the pain.

I hurt myself today.

These are the 54, 10,

17s. Yeah, that kinda

sucks. What about MNTS?

I scalped it a little bit yesterday. I'm still down on it,

but I'm giving it a shot.

The last time...

Wait, what? No, don't do that. The last time

that I played this, you know, back at the...

Jesus, oh god, NNE is

absolutely fucking just screaming

to the top right now. Look at this.

This is

when we bought... This is what's wild.

Right before I got off stream,

I was like, okay, I'm taking...

I'm jumping in NNE here.

And this guy goes NNE

back to 38, I bet. And

the funny thing was, is that we

caught the absolute bottom

of the drop

before I got off stream.

That was the bottom.

It's like CRM all over again.

And look at this. Our 1070

$54 calls are absolutely insane

right now. I'm out, I'm out.

Yes? Oh god.

She's saying that this morning

she had to wake up at 5am to cook food

because she's fasting for me.

And, um, what does

that mean? It's a weird thing.

She's not allowed

after the sun rises until

the sun sets, or until the moon.

So, from the

before the sun, from the time the sun

rises until the moon rises,

she can't even have a single drop

of water. That's it. She can't

eat, she can't drink, she can't have

anything. And then,

when the moon goes up,

her and I have to go out.

This is every year. We go

out and we have to look at the moon.

And she has to, like, look at the moon

through her fingertips or something.

And then,

she has to go down and touch

my feet. And then

she can eat. I think

it, you know, I personally, I

but it's her thing and she wants to do it.

Now, I told her this year, when you go down

and touch my feet, don't come up until I'm finished.

You know what I mean? But that's just

a little different. It is what it is.

Like, I mean, this is a real thing. Some people do it.

I'm not, like, I'm not really, like,

it's not that I'm not in, like, I think

it's, oh, it's bad because it's, like, some

like, misogynistic thing or whatever. Like, she

shouldn't do that because, you know,

this is a, you know, she's equal to me.

She doesn't owe me anything and like that.

But she still wants to do it, so I'm like,

alright, fine.

Um, so she was up at

5 a.m. this morning.

It's for your longer and healthy

life, dummy. No, I know what it's for.

I'm saying that the act of it feels

different, okay? Because it's just different.

But you gotta respect other people's stuff.

And if she believes that that's gonna

give me a healthy, longer life and she

wants to do that, then I'm all

for it. Um, but,

uh, it's because she feels bad

you didn't get a dowry. Okay, bro.

I'm completely new to stocks and I'm a

student, so I'll be in your care, guys.

Oh, Lord.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

That's, oh no.

Why would you say fresh meat? This isn't a prison.

Just ban him before it's

too late. I'm pretty sure that's how

cults start. Alright, let me get back

so I can get back to the market. So she woke up

this morning and she goes,

I got up at 5 a.m. and I checked

Robinhood and it lets

me gamble on when the government shutdown

is gonna end.

I'm glad you found it. It's called prediction

markets. It's like

pure gambling. No, no, no, no. You're gonna be

a billionaire in a week. You know why?

Because you're always right.

And since you're always right, prediction markets are

the perfect thing for you.

Right? I want you to do this because we're

gonna be a billionaire because you are always right.

And a prediction market is a

is a literal cheat code,

financial cheat code for you.

Ask her if she wants my Draft

King referral code. We got her

boys a new attic is born.

You threw away my

casino chips.

You gave them to the kids and we donated

them to fucking Goodwill

because you thought they were toys.

It's not funny.

How is that funny?

Why are you laughing?

She thought that

all the black chips that I had

kept in my little drawer at

home from when I go to play cards

were these funny things that we

got at TwitchCon

because they were the same color.

And so she gave me the kids to play with.

I panicked looking for them

How are you laughing at this?

I panicked, looked for them, realized

we had taken all of this

put it in bags and donated it.

So someone for Christmas is gonna

or somebody at Goodwill

if they're smart enough is gonna open up their toy

and find 12 black casino chips

for the Hard Rock.

I'm in South Florida. I've been to every Goodwill

in the Miami-Dade County since you said that

yesterday. Still no chips.

It's probably...

I sleep with Bayo by myself every night.

You're not threatening me.

Okay, AMAT's moving.

AMAT's moving.

Who will win in five games, Cubs or Brewers?

Ooh, that's a tough one.

Cubs.

I don't watch baseball anymore

so I don't know.

I don't know where they're playing.

I don't know what their records are.

I'm not a single player on either team.

I often forget Milwaukee has a thing.

But when you said that, the first thing

that popped in my mind was Cubs. I don't know why.

Oh God, the only stock

I own that's red right now is Chewy.

I'm about to hear about this shit.

You wanna know how I know Chewy's having a good day?

Because my wife doesn't ask me about it.

Oh yeah, you're the stock guy? Okay.

I'm a stock god? Oh God, now here we go.

Oh, here we go.

Now I'm fucked. Because now

she's been taking all my plays

that I've... giving her conviction plays.

She's all fucking done well because everybody's a genius

in a bull market. She tells all her co-workers

they think she's a stock genius and now she thinks

I'm... so now she's gonna ask me and then she's gonna get

one that's bad and then I'm never gonna

hear the end of it. Like my chat.

You enjoy a bull market?

You joined a bull market?

We've been in a bull market for 20 fucking years.

What are you talking about? Oh, okay.

Holy lord

have mercy. NNE is absolutely

going wild. This is crazy.

You're down 75% on VCIG? Oh, I already

cut that shit once. They wouldn't let me buy it anymore. I let it go.

At least you get laid for your picks.

Oh, you think that... you think I get laid

from that? Wow, good

fucking pick up on NNE yesterday.

Little bit early on my sells

though, Jesus. Check out

Oklo. We've been in Oklo since it was 20 bucks.

Can't you see he's the man?

Let me hear you applaud. He is more

than a man. He's a shiny golden god.

Yeah, this is where we bought Oklo.

We traded it the first time in November.

Traded it here and then we bought it right here at

1974. Of course, I

sold it when it hit, I think, uh...

60 bucks.

I think it was right here. And then I bought

the dip on NNE. You traded stocks

in 1974?

2024. Thanks for the

zero-day Disney signal, Stocky. I'm up

50%. Ok, first off, there

was not a signal, and second of all,

zero-day is absolutely stupid.

Ok. You know what?

You're gonna make me do something dangerous.

Have you traded open? We actually got

into open when it was under $1.30 and

sold when it was $7. And then when it went to

$10, I took puts on it. Alright, you know what you're

gonna make me do? You're gonna make me do something dangerous and stupid.

And I want you to know, because you said that, I'm gonna do something.

I'm gonna do something because of you.

Ok? You're a horrible human being

for making me do this. Cause I should

be more responsible. That's right.

That's right. You

just made me buy

December 260

AMAC calls. Alright.

Give a course to learn basics

of stocks for everyone. You want

me to... Ok, what the...

First off, that's not my

job. Second of all, I'm not

gonna teach you about how to trade stocks

because let me tell you something. How I trade stocks

is how I trade stocks. If you try to

trade stocks like I do, you will get fucking wrecked.

Ok? Alright?

Everyone has to have their own way of doing it.

And second of all, trading is gambling, right?

Whether it's day trading, whether it's swing trading,

you just lower your risk depending on how much

you put in and how long you're willing to hold and what type of

stock you play. I'm not gonna give a course

on that. That is something you have to do

on your own, ok? I can...

You can learn the basics of it and if you go into my

Discord at the top, it says Stock Market Basics.

There's two GitHub links that send you to all the free information

you need out there. You should be not

in trading. You should be investing, ok?

The market is there for you to grow money, not make

money. Now, if you want to trade, you have your

401k, your IRA, you have your long-term investing,

your DCA, your HSA, you have all that good shit done and you

have mastered all that and you want to gamble a little bit or you

want to predict some things by buying something

or buy individual companies to invest

in or... Remember, there's

a difference between an investment and a trade. You want to do all that,

there's a lot of things you can do. You can paper trade,

you can practice, you can stick around a little bit.

I'm not gonna give a course on that.

There's no... First off, there's no such thing

as a course on how to trade stocks. I could

teach you what things mean. I can

educate you on things, but I can't teach you

how to trade stocks.

I could teach you how to hit a buy button

and a sell button and what... educate

you on what IV means or what

bid and, you know, ask

bid spread is or what dark pools are.

I can educate you on that. I can't teach you

to do that. Ok? That's something

you have to do with your, you know, hands

on. You know what I mean? You have to learn it, ok?

You can't... There's no

teaching you. That's why all these scams out there

I'll teach you how to trade stocks. No, you can't.

You can educate people or

you can scam people. Ok? That's

the only two things you can do.

There's just... There's no in between. Like,

I can teach you about

like going... Let's say you go to the casino, right?

And you want to play blackjack. I can teach you

the book, right? I can teach you about...

The only course you're getting from me

is intercourse.

I'm not angry. No, no. I'm not angry. I'm just like

I'm passionate about this stuff because I see too many

people. Right now, this

is the best time. This is better than

2021 to be a LARPer

right now in the finance

world. If you want

to make money right now,

you don't even use the stock market.

You use

the

idea of the stock market

to screw people over.

Right? I mean, I could

sit here and post all day long my percentage

return on HUT and

even PlugNow and

Hive and Dpro and

SoFi and Palantir and

Chewy. I'm up hundreds of percent

on so many things. I could use that

and just post that and be like, see what I did?

Pay me 200 bucks a month or

give me 500 bucks for a course and I'll teach

you how I did it. And then what?

Then you move on and have to learn it and then

the market changes and the stocks change and the

momentum changes. Now, what do you do? Right?

Shit, I need somebody to tell me what to do now and

then you got to pay for another. You just buy,

man. If it's a good

company, just buy the total market. Don't even fucking work with a company.

If you're going to invest in a company,

then you find out if it's a good company.

Are they a strong company? Do they have a

future? Is there something that we're moving towards?

But you taught that lesbian girl how to...

Okay, no. What? No.

You taught us how to use the pillow though?

What's your opinion

on Dfly and SoFi?

Well, Dfly we traded recently.

That's a different stock.

SoFi, I still think SoFi is a buy.

I've done many videos on it.

Actually, my new,

my long-form editor just

clipped out the

part where I broke down, where that guy

reached out to me, that well-off guy reached out

to me on Instagram and asked me about stocks and why I gave him

my three stocks. If somebody put a gun to my

head and said, you have $750,000, you have to buy $250,000

of three stocks

for the next five years, no matter what.

And you can't touch it. What would you buy right now?

And my three stocks were Google,

Oh, and SoFi. And I gave my breakdown on that.

I think SoFi,

is,

you know, in the short term, maybe,

you know, valuations change

because value is just based on what people want to pay for.

But I think SoFi is

going to continue and absolutely

disrupt the fuck out of the

finance world. And I think with the BBB

and people, I think people don't understand

what this means.

If you've looked at their chart

and how much

users they've grown by and

what they're, you know, that's just another thing.

But I don't think people have understood

what this BBB thing is going to do.

They're cutting

the amount of

student loan borrowing from the federal

federal student loan program

by tens of thousands of dollars

and cutting entire other programs out.

But colleges are not going to get cheaper.

So that means people who are going to

college are going to have to continue to pay more.

And if they can't get it all

from the government, they're going to have to get supplemental

loans from private

companies. And because SoFi has spent

all their goddamn time and money,

marketing and acquiring younger users

and getting that name brand recognition

out there, who do you think is going to be the number

one, you know,

beneficiary of that?

What's the bear case for SoFi?

That it is digital?

That a lot of these people are going to default on

their loans because they can't pay because if we

hit a recession or

the labor market doesn't do, because the

number one

demographic for

increase in unemployment right now

is recent college grads.

Recent college grads, almost 9%

of recent college grads are unemployed. They cannot find

a job. And they can't pay back

their student loans. So they're going to default on those loans.

That could be underwritings that are hit

for SoFi, okay? Number two,

SoFi has spent an ungodly amount of money and continues

to do for

user acquisition.

And if there's a slowdown

in users that sign up and

assets under management for them,

then there's going to be concern from investors that

they're not going to get that long-term return on that,

right? Because you're spending all this money and you're not

catching that market share. There's also

competitors out there. And so,

you know, with tokenization and with

crypto and with, you know, there's a lot of

competition out there. I always do a bear case

for everything that I'm in. Oh, you weren't

ready for that, huh? See,

here's the thing. You're only used to people

that make investments and that are invested in something

telling you why it's good and why it's going to go

up and whatever like that. Nobody's going to give you their

bear case on it. That's because those motherfuckers are

they're just doing their thing. I'm going

to give you, there is nothing I am in

that I am not aware that could have a bear case.

What's a good buy rating for

SoFi long-term? A

buy range? Here's the thing about

any stock. Do you think

the value of the stock is going to be higher

than it is now in 10 years? Yes? Then buy.

Oh, but what if it goes down? Then

buy more. Like, you don't

buy, you don't wait for the dip to

buy something for 10 years from now.

If you think the value of it is going to

be higher than it is in 10 years, then you start

buying now. This is how it is.

This shit of waiting for it. Do you know how

many people in here waited

for another pullback on Dpro?

Or UUU?

Or any of those? I'm not saying

that they're going to do well for a long time.

Do you know how many people in here didn't jump

into Google with us when it went under

$80 a couple years ago?

And then, there was a small pullback to $145.

And people were like,

well, if it goes under $120, I'm going to buy again.

I'm like, shit, we're up almost

100%. I'm buying more.

Because I think it's going to be higher in 10 years. I think Google

is the most undervalued of all the Mag7s. I've been saying that

for a year. Again,

it is what it is. That's why dollar cost

averaging is so important and reoccurring

buy so that you don't make those decisions.

Let the computer do it for you. Because

the more you do make your own decisions, the more

you get in your own way, the more you fuck it up.

Alright, I got to stop that at Orbs.

Well, half of it stopped out.

Thank you, Bale. Good boy.

Good boy. There you go, boy.

You're a good old boy now. Yeah, good boy.

Shot caller. Oh, God. Are you guys

still on that shit?

I'm not even like, I'm not telling anybody they

can't be upset about things

if they don't like them, but like,

bro, don't bring that shit in here, man. I'm not here

to fucking discuss that. I finally

went and saw the video that you guys, because

you guys kept talking about this shock

thing and this whatever, and I finally went

and saw the video, so at least I know

what you guys are talking about now, but Jesus,

y'all are still on this shit. We love

a witch hunt. It's not even, listen,

my kind of thing is, is I'm the type of person

who, just like with my personal

politics, I have personal ideas about things,

but unless I have

proof of something or shadow of a doubt,

kind of thing, I just bite my tongue

because it's like, you know what I mean?

I can understand a lot of the

controversy and stuff like that, and people

have, but again, that's,

I don't think it's about the dog anymore.

I don't think anybody really

cares in this

situation. People who really think

that he did what they say he did, or people who

think that it's a lie,

the funny thing is, is it's no longer about the dog.

It's only about

attacking or defending the streamer.

And that's why I don't want to

even mention it, because nobody really gives a shit

about the dog, okay?

I'm being honest with you.

I don't have a dog in this fight,

no pun intended, but this

is not about the dog. Maybe it was for

a few minutes, but it's not anymore.

So like, you know what I mean?

It's just the truth.

Thanks for Disney calls. Make cat food in the

payment. I have no clue what you're talking about.

I had no clue until these guys wouldn't shut up about it

yesterday, and then I went and

guess what?

Your dog got run over by a car!

Any time I forget I said something, I get reminded.

Also, if I have any mods

in here, if you guys could help

a boomer out at some point, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks for the Orbs call.

Fun fact! During the morning call,

Orbs was at 1050,

I had gotten it at 1030, and it immediately

ran 16%. I just didn't

sell it. Holy shit, I sold Disney

weeklies for a tiny loss that would have made my week.

Well, that was the main one that we

looked at this morning. We thought that there was a

really good chance that the

park news was going to make them run, because

the last time they announced something

like this, it was huge.

They ended up having a 7%

day. Now, I don't think they're going to have a

7% day, but this was our

main after

open focus, because

they make a shitload of money from their parks,

and every time they raise prices, people just keep

going. You need soups,

Eid, or a Shema? Yeah, because

there's no way in fuck I'm making you an admin.

Anyone else looking at Macy's?

No.

Fuck, Disney was the play, huh?

Oh shit, AMET's moving now.

Can you break down Whirlpool?

You want me to break down

Whirlpool? Texas

or Oklahoma this weekend?

Ooh, that's a tough

one.

I haven't watched college football in a long

time either.

Oh, Oklahoma, 100%.

Isn't that Manning kid at Texas now?

I went to Oklahoma.

Well, that explains a lot.

As a Jags fan,

no matter how much I respect the

play and the game of

Peyton Manning, I have to hate him

because of the Colts.

And so,

by that, I have to

root against Texas.

But,

it feels like this, I don't know

anything about, you know, I don't follow

college football anymore, but I would say

that Oklahoma's going to go in there and

absolutely destroy

Texas because

this is one of those things

that their coach probably tells them.

This rivalry's been going on for years.

Texas has this Manning kid

who's like the next one. I want you to

end him. I want you to

make him, I want you

to make him

be benched before halftime.

Bench that kid.

I'm talking some fucking,

you know, what was the movie?

God, what was that movie again? Remember

the Titans shit. They don't

play in another yard.

They are going to bench that kid.

At least that's what the coach is going to tell them.

Bounty gate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not

bounty gate like they're going to hurt him. I mean like

they are going to do like

here's what you do. Here's what you do.

And this is what the, just hear me out, okay?

I'm about to role play again. Not as bad as the one yesterday

with the car salesman. But you're

the Oklahoma coach, okay?

The defensive coordinator.

Your idea is, is that

this is a statement game. Everyone

expects you to beat them, right? But it's still a rival

game. And people are like, well, it's rivalry games

and shit changes, right? I mean,

I remember in college basketball because I grew up a Tar Heels

fan and there were divorces over

the Tar Heels, the North Carolina

Duke rivalry. It was insane.

And they,

it was insane. And sometimes Duke

would be ranked, you know, number one and

North Carolina would be unranked and

they would be, beat them or have a one point

game and vice versa because rivalry games are pretty

intense like that. We had one in our high school.

I went to a high school in western

North Carolina called Tuscola High School.

We were the only high school in the county, right?

And the next county over, there

was a

high school called Pisgah,

right? And

it was wild because

you know,

we had been playing each other every

year for like a hundred years.

And it didn't matter if the,

if one team was 10-1 and one

was 1-10 or whatever.

Every time they would play,

our stadiums would go from a few

hundred fans to 10,000

people. They would fill the stands, they would get

people up in the fucking, they would bring in extra stands

or people sitting up on trucks. It was insane

because it was a rivalry game, right?

And sometimes it would be a very

close game even if the teams were completely mismatched.

So you gotta think about it

this way, right? Think about it this way.

Thanks for selling orbs.

Hee hee loser. Hee hee

half of it got stopped out. Loser.

I live in Charlotte County,

born and raised in North Carolina. Statement is true.

Our county high school was the same way.

Yeah, so here you go.

Motherfucker in chat thought he was cooking

but he just learned what a tiered stop loss is.

So back to what I was saying.

So here you go. Oklahoma's defensive coordinator

says they're expecting it to be a close

game. It's gonna be a packed stadium.

This kid has all this pressure. He's gonna be

this great. The mannings and stuff like that and he's

kinda shook this year, right? He's getting a lot

of criticism this year. Why?

Because, you know, he's got all

these expectations. And he's

gonna wanna show up in this game because it doesn't

matter how bad you start out. If you fucking

have this win against Oklahoma every

one will forget about your start.

Nobody cares about your start if you beat Oklahoma.

Number six ranked in the country, you know,

whatever. You're gonna go into Texas,

you know, whatever, and you go into there.

Arch Manning is home turf. He beats them.

That's what everybody's waiting for. It could happen, right?

No, it's not. The kid's

under pressure and he's shook. So you know what we're gonna do?

We're gonna play some crazy fucking defenses.

We're gonna

show blitz and then we're gonna back off.

We're gonna show zone and we're gonna fucking do

corner blitzes. We are gonna make this

kid fucking regret

this. And he's gonna be

frazzled and he's gonna make mistakes and he's gonna get sacked.

He's gonna throw interceptions. And once that happens

and now he's down, he's

playing bad, he knows there's pressure, the fans

are waiting for him like that, he's gonna

crumble. He is gonna fucking

psych himself out. They're gonna have to switch to the

run. And once we stuff the run

and we run up, they're gonna have to throw

because it's the only chance to come back and that's when we take him out.

We pick him. Sack him and pick

him and they're gonna bench him. That's what you're

gonna do. Okay, my bad.

I almost went too far. And let me tell

you something right now. As a Jaguars fan,

no one knows more about someone

who's supposed to be the next greatest generational

quarterback absolutely fucking letting you down.

Oh shit, I'm up 6% on my AMET

calls already.

I would've done better with Disney, but it's okay. I'll

take one. Alright, I

guess I'm gonna sell my last fly call, guys.

We're up 240% on

this. I mean, it doesn't expire till

February, but yeah.

I don't really see a reason to hold it any longer.

I know. This is the buy signal.

Like CRM yesterday. Remember we took

CRM on the dip because they told the hackers,

fuck you, we're not paying you.

And so we took them because of that, even though

most people would think it was a really dumb

reason.

And we nailed the absolute bottom when we

bought those calls. And then it dipped

the next day and then we sold right there and they just kept

going. And then it opened up. I don't even want to look what it

was today. You're up 89%

on BBAI today? I haven't looked at BBAI

today. What was the news?

Is that your wife being pinged on Teams? Yes.

By the way, so

this is an update to our TwitchCon

thing. Alright,

so we talked this morning, before that,

we talked this morning about Delta.

Delta had earnings recently. Now,

airlines, we've talked about airlines before.

Airlines, especially international

airlines, they don't make money

on the actual

tickets, right? Like they

lose money on their economy and stuff like

that. They make, they used to make

all their money from first class and business class,

but now it's like

basically in-game purchases.

Their money

is coming from additional purchases.

Okay? And that's why you saw

Southwest Airlines for the first time

actually

start charging for bags.

It used to be always bags fly free. Not

anymore. Not anymore.

They just don't. Okay?

Morgan Freeman's nips.

Good to see you again. And so

this is, this is not, this is not

you know, is

fleshlight up or down? What does that

mean? What does that mean? I mean, I want to answer,

what the fuck does that even mean? I don't even know how to answer that question.

I don't know what the question is. Honestly,

if you don't have something that's automatic nowadays,

you're just broke. Okay?

Like who the fuck is still using, you know what I mean?

Alright. So,

airlines are making all of their money

from basically a la carte purchases,

right? Everything that used to be included

is now a charge.

And it's going to get worse.

Okay? Alright?

It's going to get worse.

You now have to pay for, you know,

literally everything. Whether it's, it's

check baggage, whether it's

the boarding, you know, whatever,

you know, what

group you're in boarding with,

you know, you have to pay for

peanuts and water and fucking

wifi and everything like this. Now

the thing is, is that instead,

here's where they're making their money, right? So they

didn't make any money. So they didn't make

any money. Let me just show you the genius

of this. I know it's fucked up, but this is the genius.

You're like, how are airlines making money, right?

How do they make money? It doesn't make any sense, right? Because

they're giving tickets away for dirt

cheap. Well, that's the way you do it. Think

of it like video games, okay?

There used to be a time when there was no such thing

as a free video game, right? Why would there be a free video

game, right? Nobody makes any

money off of that. All that work to build a video game,

you don't make any money off of it, right?

Consoles and stuff like that. Same thing with airlines, right?

They were losing money because

they only made money on their first class of

business class. And if they didn't

have that, then it was just about volume of traffic.

Well now, they've

figured out how to do IRL microtransactions.

Okay? So

here's what they decided to do.

They don't want to add more business in

first class, right? Because those are big

seats with TVs and stuff like that.

And these are usually 3x to

5x the

cost of economy, right?

So you have your economy seats back here.

And let's say that it cost you

$250.

Well, that's going to cost you $1,000.

And it worked out.

Because you're 4x-ing what

you're getting here, but you're only losing

three seats worth of

space.

And if it's first class, you're talking about 10x, right?

So that's how they kind of made their money.

Not anymore.

Here's what they did. How do we

continue to make money here, but make

even money back here? Well, we're going to start

check bags, right?

That's number one.

Number two, boarding

order. Okay?

Picking seats.

Okay? Fucking beverages

and snacks. Okay?

Lounges.

After COVID, they had so many people

in the lounges, they had to start cutting them.

And the list goes on and on and on.

By the way, guys,

you didn't notice this,

but over the past five years,

they have decreased

the size, slowly,

of what is acceptable as a carry-on.

You've lost about two inches

here, about one inch here,

and about a half an inch in depth.

You didn't notice that, did you?

Nah, they didn't tell you that.

They didn't tell you all about that, right?

So, yeah, you've got that.

I could go on and on and on

and on and on.

My wife's watching and heard you and said she has the same

problem, or she's dealing with the same

problem.

What? Okay, regardless, let's keep going.

Alright.

Is she talking about from her ex to you or something?

Okay, moving on. So,

I've done videos on this before, on how they've

got bounty programs now for

agents to find out

if your carry-on is too big or not, and they get like

five, ten, twenty bucks if they make you check it, and whatever.

Increase the price there. Prices are

going up everywhere. But now they've

developed something else. They said, we got an idea.

How about this?

How about instead of adding more

first class

and business class, what

if we just take the same

fucking seats,

right? And if we're getting

250 bucks a pop

for these seats,

what if we took one row out,

right? Minus

$750, and put

all of these seats three inches further back.

And charge $100

more for it. So let's just

take minus three

seats, $750,

and then add

three inches to 15 seats.

Think about that. We'll call it

Economy Plus.

That's a, that's no way that's

gonna work, Stocky. Why would somebody

pay an extra hundred bucks for three additional

inches? Babe, just be

quiet, okay? So,

alright, that's what

they did. And you might say,

this isn't gonna do anything.

Well, you're wrong.

Emerald Queen goes, I would. So,

this is what we found out.

Delta had their earnings

yesterday, right?

I gotta remember to not just put the ticker for people who

don't trade stocks. Delta had their earnings.

That's the bell dress I got

her. Now,

they had their earnings. And that

three extra inches is bringing in

billions. Grow the fuck

up, Jay. Just grow up. They're

running out of time.

And look at this.

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

It's a

that almost every single person who booked a basic economy and did the upgrade to economy plus

never went back apparently once you get that extra three inches you never settle for less

they mean an extra few inches are always good shut the get the fuck out of here you've been

waiting five minutes to say that oh it's way bigger than i thought your wife said you were

packing what she's talking about don't worry about it all right she's she's she's turning

into a streamer all right all right moving on listen yeah the only thing i'm packing is for

this fucking trip now this is this is this i'm you what i don't understand your stream this guy's

actually teaching us and talking about stocks and some interesting things but he's making it

fucking weird yeah that's how you learn you weren't going to learn about this now but now

anytime somebody says three inches you're going to think of two different things now okay all right

now here's the thing

here's the thing nobody's going back and and the ceo said within a few quarters premium seats are

going to overtake revenue of of their main cabin that means they're going to end up taking out

another row and putting in you know five you know putting all the seats back three inches again

this is the new hack then eventually you get rid of all the regular seats and premium becomes a

new basic and ladies and gentlemen you just learn how inflation well sorry shrinkflation happens

okay

it's like the frog in the in the boiling water thing right like put them in there as hot it

jumps out you put in slowly you see what i mean like that's what's going to happen now you guys

remember those seats that we saw there's two seats that they're there's one that they're doing it's

the stadium seats right that look like this so they could fit more and then they're even thinking

about doing the for short flights the standing only where like it looks like this where you're

basically doing the doing the standing and they can do the standing and they can do the standing

and they can they can put those a shitload of those well this is true we've covered these

they want to pack you in two inches later there's always gonna be people like me who just don't give

a shit so we just i mean my wife and i booked basic economy and they're like are you sure you

want this i'm like yeah they're like just so you know you don't get to choose your seats and you

may not sit together i'm like that's the fucking point um also you're going to be last to board

okay

i'm not in any rush to fucking sit on the plane why am i in a rush to sit on the plane i'd rather

sit out here where i can go to the bathroom i can spread my legs and i get or some strip my you know

stretch out my legs i can do whatever i want i'm not in any rush to get on the plane i have a

fucking backpack i'll just throw it in there if there's no room i'll fucking put it under the

thing all right fun fact you know my wife's checking a bag anyway so if we get to the we

get to the uh on the thing and they say we're in a room we'll check it for you for free well

fuck it i gotta do check bags anyways because my wife so fuck it fuck it

i don't care i'll just take out what i need and just do that i'm not in any hurry

you know what i mean you didn't spread your legs when you're in the wheelchair yeah but

that was yeah i'm sorry that you know sometimes i have to i have a hard time walking when the

pain gets too bad granted i didn't need it for every flight but it did get us through customs

quicker um i'm talking about short flights listen when we went when i go to europe i i i go business

class i don't book business class but i fly business class and i save a lot of money

doing it my wife got to do it for the first time and i fucked up because i thought wow she's never

done this she's really enjoying herself and then all she learned from it is when we send her parents

back to india we are booking them business class from here to india i explained to her it's

expensive and she said then make more money and you're wondering why my streams have been longer

lately poor china man nah fuck that guy okay maybe he should have fucking been smarter with

his investments and had more retirement that he could spend okay all right he had a cane i don't

okay i had more money i'm talking about the hack i taught you guys about the business class it's not

always going to work but you're not losing anything and if you do get it i mean every

single time i have flown across internationally except one time it's worked for me and i've

saved tens of thousands of dollars and still flown business class each time i mean fuck the

only reason we didn't do it on the way there was because it was an empty flight and uh the guy was

really nice he oh i'm supposed to reach out to him uh and he and he we talked about podcasting

and stuff like that and and he booked us our own roads so we had our own like sleep you know

rose so we didn't need to book it but otherwise it was fine must be nice must be nice last example

it didn't sound like you saved much wasn't it still like eight hundred dollars more sir if i

book business class from miami to amsterdam it is generally thirty six hundred to five thousand

dollars if i book an economy it's generally about eight hundred dollars and if i do my trick

it costs me about seven hundred and fifty to eight hundred dollars more that's sixteen hundred

that's less than half to one-third of what it would have cost me to book it directly

yeah but you get a guarantee i don't i'm not looking for a guarantee i'm planning on flying

economy i'm not gonna book a five thousand dollar ticket there's no way in hell but if i can get

this for that why not i give it a shot and every time except once it has worked i'm not turning

tricks for upgrades fun fact

the first time i did it was almost an accident and it's all because of that that that newly

married couple from uh ecuador or whatever that's the only reason that i i like i used this trick

and it worked perfectly and i knew it's something i had known about but i never really tried it out

and until i did that and it was my first trip to have this like six five years ago twitch con

and i was like i was like you know i'm gonna do it and it worked no not turning tricks no you don't

turn tricks scam ecuadorian couples no

you guys i even i even have the picture from when i when i documented that whole ordeal in

amsterdam after covid during the heat wave when they like were backed up and we had to like i

spent five hours in line and they had to like go through the airport then outside for two hours and

then back in and then right at the end i saw annie fuchsia get put under the fucking uh they let her

under the the pylons like right in the front of the line i'm like i've been and then she got caught

and i caught her and so like then the guy was like oh shit i gotta help both of them and then

we got to it's the only reason i made my flight but i sat i went to my seat and i had

the window seat and there was this young couple and they were looking out the window or whatever

and i speak enough spanish that uh i was i was like i was letting her sit by the window and

i said um and they moved over and i was sitting there and the girl looked over and and and just

basically i asked him i was like you know are you guys heading home i said you know i asked him

where i said i said donde tu casa you know like where's your house not like where's your home but

like where you live and like ecuador and then they said that they just got married and they were here

and they didn't look like they'd come from a lot of money so i'm assuming this was a big trip for

them into europe and i could see how like i could just see how like excited like how much she was

looking out the window and how like this was a big this was like the last leg back before they

had to go home and i was like fuck man i was like god damn it it's like you guys want to sit by the

window and she just all lit up and all right you sit by the way so i'm sitting in the aisle and

i'm just sitting there and we're about to take off and so i looked at the head um dutch like

you know it's a dutch lady it was an old

lady like you know blonde hair but really tall in her and she's like walking through very strong

i said excuse me she goes what do you want like i was like do you have anything available in the

front let me see i have one i was like uh how much would it how much would it you know how

much would it cost to upgrade it's 550 euros um can i can i go ahead and do that you wait

i'm like what what you wait i'm like what am i waiting for

i must speak with with the other flight attendants so she go i'm like jesus fucking

christ like what's going on she comes back you can have it oh for upgrade oh no for 550 euros

i'm like okay so she hands me this like ipad and like i'm shaking as i put my credit card

she's looking at me and then looks down at me and looks back up again like it's not gonna work

and it goes and then she goes you're in seat 2e enjoy your flight

okay like chill that's cool we're cool lady it's all good like i got the money like i'm good

i wasn't you know i wasn't trying to get anything free out of you she was french no but i still have

the thing they gave me if you fly on the dutch airline at the end they give you this little

house filled with booze and you have to collect the whole city but i didn't do it and i don't

drink so i kept it i have it here somewhere

oh it's funny now isn't it fucking gave my money away why do i have money and chips and real money

number one because uh you couldn't you couldn't spend it uh number one number two anytime i get

to unfortunately for you when i go and play cards a lot of times i leave with money i just don't

want to i don't want to spend time at the uh why why are you in your fucking bra and panties just

putting on lotion looking at me like you're doing that shit on purpose you do this every day and you

smack your ass like that too

you're coating your ass with what with lotion it's called skincare what do you call it when i coat

your ass with something else that's the best natural skincare really because you were crying

about your dress yesterday okay i'm sorry we were still we're still streaming so but the worst that

wasn't the worst one the worst was when i because usually now i use the trick before i get on it

because remember you have to do it an hour before boarding is when they close the front gate and

ticket sales that's when you do it and so i usually

pay for it then i paid for it and i was wearing my you know my my camo pants and my like

shoes with holes in them and like some fucking shirt and a hat and looking like this and i sit

there and as soon as i get in there i go i go in and the lady goes right this way sir i said no no

i'm i'm i'm in business class she goes excuse me i go yeah i'm i'm actually to the right not to the

left can i see your ticket this was an american she goes can i see your ticket and i go yeah it's

right here she goes right this way i sit down two more times

someone came by and asked me to see my ticket what is this this is a fucking james bond movie

next time take a shower listen here you little shit okay that wasn't it wasn't i was showered

it's just i don't dress like the people that go there because a lot of people want to impress

i'm in business class people have to see me i'm like whatever man like i'm just i wear

comfortable clothes have you ever thought about getting laid on the airport i actually um when

we were in different seats on the way to europe it was an empty flight

and i kept looking over there and she was all because she just loves airports and air and she

just sitting there with all comfy little blanket on just watching something on her phone and and so

i'm like trying to get her attention because it's like it's it's it's um i'm so bad for this

so she's on the other the other line of seats for me and she's sitting against the window and i'm on

this line of seats and it's dark and everyone's asleep and so i'm trying to get her attention

but she's like watching a movie eating her little food and so i have to think fast so

i i have that little feature on your phone where i draw and then i turn it so she has to see it the

dark and she looks over and she has to see it each time and so this is what happened this was the

first picture i know i'm a child for this but i don't care whoops you had a dream we had a romantic

flight like yeah there's no such thing as a romantic flight so obviously this was the first

one i went i went and it made her laugh then i drew this one it was a picture of her riding me

on the seat by the window

then there was this one

then this one i was not sexually harassing you on the flight then of course there

and then when she then when she said no

me crying by myself so yeah so so as my wife is trying to enjoy her movie this

keeps looking over and i try i did try i did try it did not work oh oh shit what happened

here we are lord have mercy what just

happened spy dying and stock guy is sharing blowjob stick figures what was the 11 a.m trump

and ads and monetization i'm like why would you ask me to do it right like there's so many other

okay breathe breathe i'm down 70 percent of my poet calls because you're an idiot

for taking calls sell everything liquid oh here we go breathe ease you got this i i i believe in

you breathe let me see this are you in cypher not anymore no some very strange things are happening

in china they are becoming very hostile and sending letters to countries throughout the

world that they want to impose export controls on each and every element of production having

to do with rare earths and virtually anything else they can think of even if it's not manufactured

in china nobody has ever seen anything like it this but essentially it would

the markets and make life very difficult for virtually every country in the world especially

for china we have been contacted by other countries who are extremely angry at this

great trade hostility which came out of nowhere our relationship with china over the past six

months has been a very good one thereby making this move on trade an even more surprising one

i have always felt that they've been lying in wait and now as usual i have been proven right

because i'm always right there's no way that china should be allowed to hold the world captive but

they see they say that seems to have been their plan for quite some time starting with the magnets

and other elements of the world and they've been lying in wait and now as usual i have been proven

that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a monopoly position a rather sinister and hostile

move to say the least but the u.s has a monopoly has monopoly positions also much stronger and

more far-reaching than china's i have just not chosen to use them there was never a reason for

me to do so until now the letter they sent is many pages long and details with great specific

specificity uh each and every element that they want to withhold from other nations things that

are routine are no longer routine at all i have not spoken to president xi because there was no

reason to do so that was a real surprise not only to me but to all the leaders of the free world

i was to meet with president xi in two weeks at apec in south korea but now there seems to be no

reason to do so the chinese letters were especially inappropriate in that this was the day that after

3 000 years of bedlam and fighting there was peace in the middle east i wonder if that timing was

coincidental dependent on what china says about the hostile order that they have just put in i

will be forced as president states of america to financially counter their move for every element

that they have been able to monopolize i will be forced as president of the united states of america

to financially counter their move for every element that they have been able to monopolize

we have two i never thought it would come to this but perhaps as with all things the time has come

ultimately though potentially painful it will be a very good thing in the end for the usa one of the

policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase on tariffs on chinese products

coming united states of america there are many other countermeasures that are likewise under

serious consideration thank you for your attention to this matter no he did not write this well it's

what i opened up the morning call with which was trump took an l today he did not win the

nobel peace prize therefore there was going to be something that he had to do and here we are let's

keep an eye on vix here 28 pretty spike here just like the one at the beginning of august sim very

similar but unless something is announced it's going to do one of same same thing so

we'll see so i guess buy the dip right uh how many spy shares do you have right now i don't own spy i

don't know this is how the bear market starts oh here we go again oh my god sound great sound great

we just read it trump is uh trump and she are fighting should i buy the debt now or in a week

well why don't you just leg into things it doesn't have to be all or nothing i have a thing

where if the s&p 500 falls more than one percent intraday i buy uh one or two shares of uh my uh

my voo isn't voo the same as spy yeah so buy spy see you in 30 years tell me what you're what you

learn stockpile canned food and water oh god that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's

ms strat okay we're not going to any bunkers buy toilet paper not voo oh come on don't do that

shit i'm at my local walmart all the short all the shelves are bare now no they're not

refineries have run out of silver and gold no they're not the ships are gone no they're not

the ports are empty no don't start that shit again stock market prime day okay thank god i

bought some large stock of toilet paper last week no stocking of ammo no are the cheese case empty

never

cheese caves only get more full every day aristotle just said to sell everything oh god

these are the days where not him specifically because i don't know what he does but um

the the the stock um furus out there and the signal services and the course sellers

they tell all their people buy this buy this whatever and then something like this happens

and it ever gets wiped out and their answer is well shouldn't uh you know it happens guys or

you know what that's why you can't that's why you can't uh put more money in than uh than

you're willing to lose it's trading man it's it's part of the game you're gonna take losses man i

mean they can't you know whatever man it's just it you know it you know they somehow gaslight you

if you get wiped out by a one and a half percent drop in the s&p 500 you legitimately are a little

over leveraged just a little bit just a little bit you might be a little bit over leveraged or

a little bit short dated or a little bit uh risk on for example what did i say if something happens

this week you're gonna lose money you're gonna lose money you're gonna lose money you're gonna lose

this week right whether it's the feds or anything like that and we have a dip unless it's like a

really big dip and it continues we'll probably see a rotation in the divvies and what do i do

when i get runs on my i'm not saying i'm good at this but what do i always tell you guys that i do

whenever i have a big run on spec and growth stocks and i profit take on buy the dip sell

the rips right i take the profit and just buy the dip on my dividend stocks and then we get that

rotation in it helps balance me out so if you look at the market right now mo abby walmart

vtr they're green money's moving in so it's like okay we're seeing that rotation so i'm it's helped

balancing me not to mention that nvx is 50 up and you use up nine percent spec stocks were due for a

correction this isn't correction this is a blip right now we're not even close to a correction

yet unless the iwm falls 10 you're not in correction yet do you think an all-world etf

is a good choice i'm gonna be real with you and this is my opinion an all-world etf is almost

pointless now because the u.s stock market is so fucking large and is so there's so much outside

money involved invested in as well and it's so interconnected that if you're buying another

country to counter it and the u.s market fucking collapses they're all going down it's isn't this

isn't like this isn't like 1995 where if the u.s stock market goes into a bear territory another

market might you know go up to hedge against it i'm talking about like i'm not talking about like

little dips and something i'm talking about like action

if you're thinking the u.s market's gonna fall 25 30 percent you're basically fucking the whole

the rest of the country's the rest of the world's gonna do it too okay so you know you're you might

maybe blip one or two percent different you know because you've got you know other markets that

might be a little bit more stable at a time but when it bounces back up or rebounds you're gonna

miss out on all that return because all the money's gonna flow back in the u.s market and

not into those other markets when america sneezes the world catches a cold and if you say that

that you are um like a like a like a you know american uh you know you know superiority kind

of bullshit like oh fucking exceptionalism over here no it's just that's just how it is people

can't separate their emotions from from money so they hear you say that they're like oh you guys

think you're just so big because you're america you're not as big and smart you're not gonna last

forever it's like bro i'm not nobody fucking said that you you brought that to the table we're just

talking about how the market in the world's work right now it's not about that the u.s might slowly

become underperformant whilst other nations take over slowly along the way so i'm not talking about

period of time so you're gonna go ahead and stop investing in the u.s market because there's a

chance that this other thing could happen go for it i'm kind of like if i see that happening then

i'll do it but until then i'm gonna stick with what's going on you know what i mean i see it

happening then put all your money in some international shit hey you want to know something

that that that that i got made fun of a lot and i still get made fun of by people vietnam etf right

i want you to look at something let's look at spy

versus vietnam we said vietnam is most likely the most emerging market one of the top emerging

markets in the world i was thinking about china not vietnam i'm just giving an example right

so there you go there's your vietnam etf right underperforming there but if you zoom in

okay over the past just over the past few months right in line with it see what i mean it's like

the rest of the world's kind of there okay everything is so interconnected even the

smaller markets no i mean by vti instead of v or whatever

right look at vietnam's market here vietnam while it's been up pretty big over the past um

i guess over the past few months this one's still but see how it's all intertwined there

vietnam just got added to the uh the 2026 um emerging market list as well the reason that

i sold my vietnam position we sold it for a pretty big gain the reason that i sold it though was

because uh the whole thing with uh where everybody was moving out of china into other

countries in southeast asia vietnam kind of like lost that stranglehold because the whole trade war

kind of pushed um a lot of the the corporations and manufacturers into other countries instead

of naturally into vietnam your line failed you well as i said earlier not following this exact

line but this pattern so technically we're still kind of there um how's the moon cycle system

working i've been out for today before today i haven't followed the moon cycle thing plus one

okay i'll give you an l damn shit i had so many l's yesterday i lost fucking 12 fucking

casino chips because my wife thought they were toys and gave me the kids and then i donated them

to a goddamn uh goodwill or fucking i think it was goodwill or salvation army and she thought

they were the ones that we got at twitchcon which they were not they were black chips from the local

hard rock that were in a drawer near my on my nightstand and she was cleaning up and she gave

them to the kids to play with they gave them to the kids to play with and she gave them to the kids to play with

and they were the toys and then i put them in a bag for me to donate and um there were 12 chips yeah

12 black chips learn from your mistakes they are investments all right uh we have to get to uh

call in zillows and um react andy shit because uh it is what is friday even though friday dgen

friday's in a longer dgen which hey you know what i've been following my my um my stream stuff and

it turns out that uh whatever the fuck i've been doing for a long time i've been doing for a long

for the past several months is working because hey look we were right about vix falling um it's

been working so uh apparently the streams have been better than ever uh so but but uh so i guess

uh doing just whatever we're doing is working but i still have to keep with tradition so let's do

that um how high do you think cat x will go oh i'm already out of cat x that was one of our that

was our main play today or one of our main plays today actually uh was a nice trade this morning

um i it's cool all right how will ever financially recover

uh mcdonald's we're going to mcdonald's we're just gonna go to mcdonald's we're gonna do the

monopoly game that's what we're gonna do why the fuck did you even buy that stock that was our

tofriolo today we do tofriolos every day no the mcdonald's monopoly game is back we could just

start another monopoly uh crime ring hey wait we're making money on max 10 free codes per day

oh really i don't even go to mcdonald's so i don't know thanks for max what are you thanking

making me an alpha that's right now buy my course and i'll teach you how to be an alpha every day

you guys know about the the mcdonald's uh uh monopoly game uh crime ring right is unc sponsored

now yo i pay a lot of money to bullshit corporations so i don't receive ads stop

advertising advertising what first off you don't sub to my channel so you watch ads so as much as

down the system and hate corporations you're literally voluntarily taking fucking advertisers

from them so first off you lost that battle son and uh we were talking about about something else

this isn't an ad for mcdonald's it was a joke you know what fuck that guy you know what i'm gonna

teach you something son all right let me tell you about this all right since apparently you don't

know what the fuck i'm talking about because uh i was talking about uh something else i'm gonna tell

you about the guy and the and the who who

ended up leading a fucking international crime ring and cheated the monopoly game okay that's what

i'm about to do here we go with this wild bullshit again what do you mean wild bullshit you don't

like my whiteboards you don't want me to do a whiteboard you hate my whiteboards you don't

want to hear about a crime ring and why you why until a documentary came out no one knew about it

can you wait 90 seconds for him he's watching an ad right now oh that's fair

fuck it i'm about to bust out the whiteboard you give me a

chance you give me a chance to fucking nerd out on history and finance and and crime i'm gonna do it

can you make this fun again stocky make what fun again i'm getting old retelling stories oh i told

the story before okay then i won't do it okay that's cool okay if i if i've talked about it

before or whatever then i'll just do the other stuff all right down one percent more of who

stocked by yeah i bought it earlier i don't think i've told it before all right fuck it i'm gonna

tell you about this and then we'll get into everything else all right let me tell you about

i bought it did it fall all right here you go i'm gonna tell you this real quick because i think

it's it's a really cool piece of uh uh really cool piece of history all right so let me tell

you about this some of y'all might know about this so when i was a kid i remember the monopoly

game man that was crazy so mcdonald's for those of you guys who don't like kill your body with

bad food uh mcdonald's has this uh this game right and it's uh it was the monopoly game and

it's been out for a while and this was back in the back in the 80s right and so what happened

originally launched this game okay and it was you know basically where you would get little

pieces for the monopoly board or whatever and if you match certain pieces right you would you would

you would win prizes and they would put the little stickers out there and they would send them all

over the country right on and and put them out there and on certain items you would you would

buy them but it you didn't have to buy them to get the tickets people didn't know that because

it couldn't be a lottery so everyone knows monopoly game right and if you match certain

pieces then you get free you know fries

or drink all the way up to like tvs and stuff like that cars and they even introduce million

dollar prizes so let me take you back guy named jerome jacobson okay for those who are just

joining coming out of ads let's talk about basically what we're doing is is i'm going to

talk about the mcdonald's monopoly scam that fucking shook the world okay jerome jackson this

guy was an ex-cop right and the reason he was an ex-cop is he had this really bad he had a disease

that really fucked up his foot right and so he you know decides he needs to get a job and what do most

cops do when they get into the private world right they go private investigator they go security

private security so he ends up working security for a company called diddler bros okay i'm dead

serious uh so he starts working for diddler bros printing okay now he is the security the head of

security for diddler bros and he's working there and six years later mcdonald's introduces this

game okay well they introduced this game and they need somebody to print up all of these tickets

well guess who they decide to print up all of these tickets they print up all of these tickets

that's right they go with diddler bros and they do that and simon marketing who's who's really well

known for this is in charge of that they they're holding you know this closely right so they're

working in tandem okay well jerome being the head of security is now in charge of of guarding and

transporting all of these little tickets right these little stickers and tickets for the monopoly

game well they were keeping this really intense right so they put it in a vault where two people

had to turn a key simultaneously it was a six inch

steel door to get through it was pretty wild and they were carried in these tamper-proof envelopes

so you've probably seen them right you put them in there and you put the the tickets in here and

then you pull this little strap that has a thing and it seals it right and and and there's no way

of like you know opening it up without knowing that it was open right so it's tamper-proof right

so you've got this well here's what happened old jj is transporting these and he has inside

knowledge to this and he thinks that this is a good idea and he thinks that this is a good idea

and he finds out that the game is actually rigged wait how's it rigged well not what you're

thinking so what happens is is they use a computer to randomize and send things out but they were

sending the winning tickets to canada right they they had tickets were getting you know it was

picking canada so the company had to go in and reprogram the software to to to keep doing it

until it picks somewhere in the united states they didn't even reprogram it they just kept

running it until it was united states so he goes wait a second wait a second

they're rigging this game technically so he sees it can be rigged so in 1989 okay he's transporting

these tick tickets everything's going fine he has this idea he understands it then the moment

happens remember how i said they were getting those tamper-proof envelopes well the company

who sent the tamper-proof envelopes sent an extra box by mistake and it lands on his desk well guess

what old jj now has his own

tamper-proof envelopes that no one else knows about but him okay inventory everything is counted

no one is the wiser okay well here's what he decided to do they had a female auditor that

would follow him around right to keep an eye on him during the transport to make sure he had eyes

on him just in case buddy system stuff like that well here's what he would do he would stuff winning

tickets in his pockets okay and what he would do is

he would switch them with the common tickets and he would dip into airport bathrooms male

bathrooms when she was she couldn't go in and he would switch them out and take his tamper-proof

envelope and switch the tickets with the common ones right okay so he knew or sorry sorry backwards

he would stuff his let me try that again he would stuff his pockets with the common ones

knowing that the bag had the winning ones would go in unseal it switch them out

and then get his own one and reseal it come out looks like nothing nothing's a problem right

because he can't leave it out in the airport he's a security so he's got to take it in with him

she couldn't see that all right but here's the problem he's got the winning tickets but he can't

redeem them himself right because everyone would realize the guy that's in charge of transporting

these is winning he can't do that he can't do that so he starts selling them to people

he starts selling the winning fucking mcdonald's tickets now remember oh i'm gonna get you another

part let me get you in a second so he's he has to sell them so he's selling them to people

so he starts selling them to people that he knew and giving some to his family because back then

they didn't track it as much right he gave one twenty five thousand dollar winning ticket because

that was one of the top prizes back then to his stepbrother he even sold a ten thousand dollar

winning ticket to a butcher for two thousand right so he was like making a pretty good return on this

but he was being careful small timing it but then it got a little bit crazier okay it got a little

bit crazier some employee in wisconsin stole a three thousand ticket roll okay now the reason

that they had rolls at the at the at the mcdonald's is is that they had to make it where it wasn't a

lottery you could technically go to the mcdonald's you can do that now except it's digital now and

ask them for a free ticket that way it wasn't considered a lottery because if only by buying

something can you get a chance at winning that's a lottery but if you give people the chance to

walk up and just ask for it for free it's no longer a lottery they don't tell you that because

they don't want to encourage it okay so

there you go next thing you know armed robberies so what did they start doing they started securing

the rolls at the front desk well jacobson had to lay low right because a lot of eyes on this because

this guy stole this big spool so now mcdonald's the authorities are watching who gets these tickets

and trying to track it back so he lays low for a little bit okay then mcdonald's comes out and

raises the stakes they put the tickets on everything fries nuggets anything you buy they

put a ticket on they're raising the stakes right because now they know

they put it on all of those people will buy more they're going to make more revenue all right well

here we go here's where it all turned he goes from small time and he's on one of his little

airport trips and he meets a guy right he meets a guy whose last name is colombo anybody know

why the last name colombo is important here that's right that's the mafia okay the colombo family

was a big mafia family in new york city okay now not the fucking tv show okay big crime family in

city they give jj the nickname uncle jerry okay old uncle jerry now they could quadruple the size

of the scam right they quadruple they get more people involved they get a lot more people involved

and jacobson started starts getting cash directly right so colombo starts working as the middleman

right he gives jerome the money just cash directly right he gets money under the table he's keeping

it quiet he he gets the money he gives the tickets to colombo colombo finds ways of of

distributing the tickets and then making more money on top of it so now they got this big thing

going on right they even started getting family members to fly to another state and claim the

winning ticket they're saying they bought it there right because you can't all be in fucking

like jacksonville florida or something you have to you have to find you make it look like it's

different this is the 80s so it wasn't quite as much easy to track stuff so they would fly

to there and say oh my god i got a winning ticket they would all win everything's going good they

basically turned america into their own little fucking monopoly board like this is like legit

well

jacobson starts buying homes and cars because what do you do when you start making money and

you're getting away with it you start thinking you're untouchable so he starts buying houses

and cars and all kinds of shit like he's having a good time he's fucking security guard right a

little bit weird that he does it but you know whatever people are you know they try to put it

in different people's names and shit they're doing what they're doing well uh he ends up

changing his name he wants to sound like a mobster so he starts going by uh the name uh

geraldo constantino not jerome jacobson geraldo constantino

well

guess what all good things must come to an end colombo gets killed in a car accident but

his wife lives well something's a little suspicious here okay something's a little

suspicious here all right the colombo family suspects she may have orchestrated this or

known about it or had something to do with it okay so now jj or geraldo constantino doesn't

have the mafia connection anymore so he's got to find a different connection so he meets

two new guys and they want to take this shit international okay they want to take this

international the problem is is that these guys weren't an organized crime family they know what

the fuck they were doing so what do they do one of the guys gives they start giving out the tickets

to like ex-crime members that were like put in jail and put in work or whatever to try to like

give them a payback they give one of the winning tickets to a guy who had been fucking previously

uh charged with drug trafficking you see what i mean so now you're putting money in places where

people are already being being uh uh uh you know you're putting money in places where people are

know watched and surveilled so now things are getting a little bit crazy well here's the thing

jerry hands out 18 winning tickets 12 of which are million dollar winners they fucking up the

stakes these are the million dollar winners now this is back in when a million dollars was worth

more in 2000 though it all comes to a head why the fbi gets a tip that one of the tickets one

of the million dollar tickets might not be so legitimate right and who was the owner of that

ticket anybody colombo's wife's dad people think the colombo family did this to get retribution

remember the guy who went to new hampshire and all that shit yeah so here we go he squeals

uncle jerry is uh is is named nobody knows who uncle jerry is but he's named and then the fbi

started interviewing a lot of the winners turns out

their home address that they put down wasn't legit right they weren't living in those states

where they claimed that they they did because you just filled it out nobody did any background

checks turns out all the money was being wired back to the same place in jacksonville

so they started tracking the calls 20 000 phone calls were tracked and they were honing in on

fucking uncle jerry here they're honing in on him well here's the thing mcdonald's is about to start

up their biannual mcdonald's game again and the fbi contacts him and tells him

hey there's something there's something going on there's somebody fucking like rigging this game

and so mcdonald's wants to back out of it they're like all right fine we don't want to be a part of

this whatever but the fbi says no let's do it one more time we're this close let's do it one more

time so sure as shit mcdonald's runs it out again okay then the mixting happens a bunch of fbi agents

pretend that they're like from a news crew or some like television organization and they want

to interview and do a story on one of the winners

so they find one of the winners he's interviewed and they catch his ass and that is how they end up

you know just taking down this entire fucking organization this whole this crime organization

now here's the thing though the story's not over we're almost there stick with me i know

this isn't your normal story but i i love these kind of fucking stories right

so now we've got this all the way down to the to the thing they finally track jacobson

they get jacobson and he confesses but with a twist he tells the fbi i want you to go easy on me

why well remember when the mcdonald's first started giving out the million dollar thing

i gave a million dollar ticket to saint jude true story that was his that was his hopefully

get out of jail free card they didn't give a shit okay he gets you know

goes to court now they're going for they're going the court proceedings are about to start

now you might say to yourself well stocky how come i never heard about this or how come i never

heard about it before the 2020 documentary hbo did well there's a reason why this didn't get

talked about much and one of the reasons he didn't get that crazy of a sentence

the court proceedings began on september 10th 2001 so instead of this being a huge international

fucking story about this crime

thing with mcdonald's and everything the world was focusing on something else mcdonald's mcdonald's

was a part-time job huh all right moving on how did this all come to a head jacobson got 37 months

in prison was ordered to pay 12 million dollars back to mcdonald's and mcdonald's was able to go

back and recover almost all of the money all the tickets all the money and stuff like that

either through restitution through judgments or through you know payments

or fucking you know decorations or everything except mcdonald's only didn't go after one prize

and one ticket anybody want to guess which one they let keep because pr is a is a motherfucker

that's right saint jude's got to keep the saint jude's kept their money okay because mcdonald's

was not about to go ask saint jude's for a million dollars back ain't no way in hell there is anybody

who even even the most fucking brain dead

like you know worst fucking pr person in the world that works for any corporation is not

going to be like yeah we should get our money back from saint jude's okay so to the guy thinking i

brought up the mcdonald's thing as a way of us making our money as an ad no it was a joke about

this story about how the the mcdonald's monopoly game became a mob fucking funded racketeering scam

and and so there you go there's there's there's your there's your whiteboard breakdown

okay that was a trump rant why do y'all hate my whiteboard so much i like them you're sponsored

by the mob no that was coherent and front interesting what why do you say that like

that that that was that that's not normal you seem surprised thanks for the cat x yolo today

stocky you saved my portfolio okay first off i didn't save it second of all i got stopped out

what is it at right now jesus mother

fucking mary of christ i was legitimately worried this morning look at this this is what i said this

morning at eight o'clock i may have bought too much cat x apparently i didn't buy enough and

i didn't hold it long enough dude just episode a five episode hbo doc in a blackout i didn't i've

never seen the documentary i really want to now now that now that i'm thinking about i'd love to

see that documentary damn we're now up a hundred and sixty

one percent on nvx yo mltx oh shit we did it boys djens that kid is gonna win his fucking school uh

tuition did you see the did you watch the ed gein movie you used to tell us that story on stream

no i haven't i haven't watched anything on i started watching something on netflix the other

day and i got 20 minutes into the first episode that was three weeks ago i bet you this kid sold

too he's probably not even still holding it anymore hell yeah brother i'm boycotting netflix

too no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

no no no no no no don't get me started up in that shit it has nothing to do with a boycott of

anything i just i have kids i ain't got time for this shit no i'm not like intentionally

not watching netflix for any reason no no no no no no no no no no no no that's that

nothing to do with that jesus we're actually hanging on we're actually doing pretty good

today considering the market because a lot of our shit's still doing well nvx is absolutely

insane we're up 62 percent today uh mo is up one and a half percent nne is up three percent

mltx is up 11 walmart's up one percent hive is up three percent uh vtr

stub uuu is up 10 now we're up over 200 on that abby's up one percent um we're hanging on pretty

well are you in tssi yes um wait what are we boy boycott netflix for we're not thanks for the

cypher signal last week i think it was two weeks ago and it wasn't a signal i sold though i made

a pretty decent gain on that how's it doing right now oh god you sold a bit at 20 damn you got the

top there cat x is still going hey we were right about the pattern i even

drew it i said i said i think it's going to fall exactly but i think we're gonna get this general

pattern it actually did that's funny the problem is is that the line has run out and when the line

runs out it obviously it all it always you know immediately like goes the opposite direction

and so i think it's a down pattern that means that means you have to take calls

not you but like okay all right here's what we're gonna do i am going to get to zillow's

and collins what time it's bigger i have to be i have to be my daughter i have to pick up my

daughter before two so i have to leave here by 140 which means i don't have time for the gym again

absolutely wild good good good good good uh good good call on that guys all right all right let's

do it let's do it i'm going to jump into discord right now and we're going to watch this we're

going to do this and here and see what's going on so we are going to go in right now uh feel free

to ignore if you want to do fun stuff stocky can you explain why verizon is pumping on anti-china

news or at least or was at least yes uh as we said if there is any volatility in this market

no one is actually capitulating in this market we might see a rotation into divvies um but it is not

pumping anymore because people are scared about um about uh verizon's new ceo with paypal plus

their ex divvy date is coming up

all right what else do we got uh who would win or in a race to who who would win in a race to

to run 100 meters and eat a hot dog joey chestnut or usain bolt who would win in a race to run 100

meters and eat a hot dog are they eating a hot dog because the way you wrote this they're eating

a hot dog while they're running or do they run and then eat the hot dog if it's run and then eat

it would be usain bolt because he's gonna get at least

10 15 seconds on joey chestnut and even if joey chestnut fucking just throat goaded the glizzy

usain bolt wouldn't need more than that to eat it so usain bolt would win that

plus usain bolt uh has to eat a lot of calories to keep up so he's probably you know he it's not

gonna be a problem for him what is 100 meters i'm not a communist um it's uh it's like a football

field god you're just so wrong no way joey takes 25 seconds to run 100 meters i mean

either way i mean even if it's i don't know man i mean he didn't look like he's in good shape

now if you said 100 meters in like five hot dogs or 10 hot dogs and maybe we'd be talking about this

but usain bolt's start to finish and eat it would be faster than joey chestnut because here's the

thing even if joey chestnut goes and swallows it down usain bolt goes that's gonna take what

two three four five seconds he's gonna beat that on the on the 100 meters

usain bolt is fat now

well i don't know what usain bolt whatever i mean there's a video of him doing it of who doing it

joey chestnut running 100 meters and eating a hot dog how does time scale affect trading the longer

you wait generally the better you do because you can outlast dips and you don't paper hands things

the person who asked this question thinks that usain bolt would take 15 seconds to eat a hot dog

let's time 15 seconds okay let's time 15 seconds all right i'm gonna pretend i'm eating a hot dog

okay bun and all

let's do 15 seconds and just

see how long that really is okay all right here we go 15 seconds okay you're running and you're in

a competition here we go i'm gonna pretend this is a hot dog okay all right here we go ready

one two three go that's 10 seconds and i was being conservative okay

if you're really pushing that shit in your mouth i mean maybe i don't know i mean that's a tough one

is it hot

out is it raining out do they get water i've watched you eat a banana in two bites well a

banana goes down your throat a lot easier now are they eating the hot dog first and then right i

mean that's a weird fucking question okay that's not what we're here for okay all right what else

we got coming in um i just got a monopoly game ad oh jesus christ really are we expecting a bigger

dip i what do you mean expecting i mean how big and how long is what you're how big of a dip and

how long time frame are you talking about i mean this market everyone has bought up everything so

fast so uh i don't expect it to last long um you know unless trump does or says something else that

would uh uh you know make it seem like they're they're they're they're actually going to put

real fucking tariffs in and they're going to keep them and all that shit like it doesn't

um it doesn't uh based on you know based on what we've seen uh from this market because

the market and economy are not the same so it's just you know obviously um

you know to each their own but i i i don't think it's going to um last too long nobody's

capitulating right now all right got our first zillow of the day let's take a look at it uh

here we are it is time for stocky to sell you this house ladies and gentlemen this is the part of the

stream where i am given a zillow i have never seen it you have never seen it i am your real estate

agent you are my client we are going to go into this house and i am going to try to sell it to

you no matter what and uh we are going to do it together so here we are we are heading to

uh 138 armenia road in sharon connecticut okay nine bedrooms eight baths twelve thousand and

fifty seven square feet seventy five hundred dollars i'm sorry seventy five hundred seven

seven point five million dollars uh seized a rare opportunity to own this it is uh the most

distinguished gilded age estate designed 1903 okay 1903 near a hospital too which is great

um and built in 1903 this is a big property let's take a look at it together ladies and gentlemen

here we are uh a little bit foggy of a day uh but here we are uh you can see that this is a very uh

you know quaint estate right now definitely looks like uh something that uh you know was was you know

i don't know somebody that was on the titanic kind of owned right nice little bench here to

read your book and you know you know where you're wearing your corset or whatever uh but it's got

that very vintage feel i love it here uh nice little look very mount vernon kind of look right

kind of makes you feel like you're on a uh an estate from the 1700s uh but uh but uh you know

yeah it's it's gorgeous there obviously you know if you can afford this house you're probably gonna

have to pay for some lawn care unless you just like getting out of the house and not having to

deal with your fucking kids right um here we go i don't know why it's always so foggy there maybe

they just had a bad day to take pictures here um you can see the road leading up to it isn't very

well worn so it means that this the house probably isn't that well worn um and which is nice because

when you're in a state like this you kind of want to get away from it all and kind of own it um you

know very very like i said very uh uh you know roman uh you know accents here it's inspired by it

you know plant not plantations jesus fucking christ uh estates from early america so uh

beautiful here you know lots of uh lots of old money um again very foggy uh in this uh in this

area here not sure what happened to this tree branch here looks like it fell and just fucking

exploded uh or something else did but you got yourself a little uh little these little things

here to kind of like welcome you in and out of the house um there you go that's beautiful that's

that that that you know i that's gorgeous right there that that's your morning walk right there

you know what i mean that is that is exactly where i expect a serial killer to pop out and just say

hey good morning neighbor good morning to you too you know uh here we are a little bit uh dated on

the stones here probably just because a car has probably run into it a lot that's probably why

they haven't drove a while they probably uh older people that that eventually after running into

these fucking things have decided you know what maybe we're not going to drive anymore so uh again

you can uh you know backhoe this road out or you could just use it for bicycles or or morning walks

um here you go you got a guest house uh or what we would call

a in-law house which is beautiful because you don't want them too close to you right you want

to make them have to put an effort to come see you uh and so you know it's like fuck it if i'm

gonna have to deal with them i'm gonna i'm gonna you know i'm gonna put them as far away as possible

but it's always nice again roman inspired architecture here beautiful uh god it's really

foggy really foggy there um just wow uh but here you go you have an actual zebra that was murdered

by someone that lived here and skinned uh for a ritual that was made into a rug i mean you don't

often get a zebra rug okay it's actually illegal now this

has probably been there for 100 years um a little bit less foggy here this is where you can sit

across from each other and uh realize that you live in a loveless marriage and that you are only

together for tax purposes and for uh for for you know your philanthropy that you got to do to lower

your income um uh so that you can actually also save taxes and you can sit here and have a picture

of uh something that used to be beautiful when you didn't have to pretend as hard uh and there's

even a little ink quill here where you can write a letter so you don't have to talk to them and say

my dearest spouse

you have withered like a rose in the desert before my eyes and then they can write back

speaking of deserts my vagina has been one for 40 years looking at your face every day

and you could do that it's like a fun form of communication you know what i mean it's like

the telephone game right um here we are more um um um more fog uh but a beautiful archway there

you got some uh some some hand-carved uh faces

up there kind of reminds you of game of thrones right little uh little little little interesting

there but uh great hardwood floor um this is uh this is where you uh you you can uh go and be

alone and uh there's no tv we always you know it's funny we always talk about how we miss the 90s we

miss time before the internet we miss time before your phone well guess what put your fucking phone

down guess what you're back in the fucking 90s get on your bike go play outside stop using that

as an excuse as to why you miss your the the childhood when we were so disconnected get

the fuck you did you no one's forcing you to be on your goddamn phone okay no one's forcing you to

be in front of a fucking computer you're on a computer complaining about always being on the

fucking interconnected put the shit down and go outside and ride a bike i miss when we could ride

bikes and do these things go ride a fucking bike it's just not the same no no like put your phone

down and do it yeah but what if somebody you know likes my post that like is gonna be there in an

hour go fucking ride a bike yeah but i don't have anybody else to ride a bike with we'll tell them

put their fucking phone down too and go ride bikes fuck i invited my neighbor to a water balloon fight

okay i bought you know what's funny i bought that um i went to goodwill and i found that game uh

ladder uh what is it called um ladder throw or whatever where you have like the things you have

the balls two balls um and they're connected together and you just um you just uh you know

throw them and it hooks on the ladder bro we've been having so much fun outside you know what i

mean uh but here you go here you can uh you can write your will uh which you will have to update

every few weeks as you find people that you hate and you love uh very uh very very cool

great for just getting away another a lot of zebras died in the making of this uh of this home

um i wonder if they ever lived on the estate maybe they lived there because you were rich

and they just died of natural causes lots of books um at some point i feel like you could

probably just buy another bookshelf rather than stacking these on the floor uh lots of paintings

too maybe there's some money there to help pay for this uh even more books fun fact uh for for

my fellow boomers out there uh remember the encyclopedias that used to have you have to all

that uh that was there those used to cost four thousand dollars for a complete set you know that

upwards of four grand for a complete set of the encyclopedias okay uh at this point in the house

i can't tell if this is dust or fog but either way it's still gorgeous look at that big sun you

can't see the sun outside but you can pretend it's there with that piece of art in the background

um here is where you eat dinner but you never eat with anyone else you always eat alone

unless you have company over but you don't have company right you don't have company

and so there's just two chairs they're not together at the table because people the the two

people who live here eat separately why you have a third chair off to the side here i'm not sure

maybe it's because you're hoping that your children who grew up and left the home and never

called you and you never even bothered to visit again because they grew up in a fucking horrible

hostile environment and actually fucking hate both of you but you leave it there just in case

they come home one day even though they're now in their 40s and live somewhere else completely

you in the country and uh and have kids that you don't you've never met in real life um but yeah

there you go you can tell by that painting right there because nobody quite nothing quite says a

happy home like two dead deers a fucking um cult a son and a dog painting um yeah there you go uh

here you go this is a woman with a stag uh this is just how what your wife reminded uh bought so

she could look and say what she wishes she could have in her life that's right um and uh three

fireplace this is where finances are discussed with the lawyer this is when this is the only time

you and your significant other husband or wife ever sit next to each other because you're mediated

by either a lawyer an estate planner or financial advisor um or a couple's therapist i don't know

uh here you go uh you can tell that this isn't used because nobody who uses their table all the

time has a uh has has nice white cloth on the table it's for looks obviously you got to put up

uh you know you got to put up the show and you can see a giant bottle of wine that is

empty after every single uh dinner because you got to get drunk this is getting really depressing

oh my god it's sunny hold on it's sunny wait a second the light i the mood is changing the mood

is changing ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen what the fuck why do you have a what

ew brother brother ew what is this that's some weird shit like are you into like do they hunt

people on this is this like a human hunting ranch this isn't even a home okay i take everything back

that i've said someone

or multiple people have been murdered on this property and they ended up on a milk carton

somewhere they're buried on this property someone is searching in like fucking new jersey

for that body but they're here in connecticut holy hell and that's where they're buried right

there holy shit this changed okay everything makes sense now this is like the rothschild

hunting lodge in uh in europe if you know you know what why did we start with this picture

didn't we start with this who's in charge of this listing you could have started with this look at

look at the difference between this is so much different wait what happened wait wait how did we

how did we start here and end here these are ai well why didn't you start with that it's like

that's like that's like putting your tinder profile up without your fucking

makeup or your fucking filters on like you don't do that you start with deception

because they want you to see what it actually looks like not fake pics then why put these

pictures on at all ask for a visit but then i would have to go to connecticut i was about to

this oh we got a crying video is this something what's going on here not again what is it use

apple pay honestly just be so careful um this is a little embarrassing to admit but if this could

help one person then i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really

sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry i'm really sorry

willing to share it should get hacked or something what the fuck my experience was um

i'm just gonna lay it out like this when you use apple pay that's real money i would laugh but my

wife found out that casino chips are real money too and didn't know that babe did you know that

apple pay is real money i didn't say that i just started using it for the first time i said did

you know there's a lady here who's actually in tears because she apparently found out that when

you use apple pay it's real money let me just hear the rest of it that's true american

dollars from your credit card if you if you have your credit card connected that's where the money

is being sourced from it's where the fuck do you think you're you think apple's just like

eat like just giving you money what the it's not like a special form of apple pay apple dollars

why they what the fuck is an apple dollar okay don't just say this is real money while you're

paying i don't know because i thought that i had accumulated a bunch of apple dollars

and i didn't know that i had accumulated a bunch of apple dollars

uh to use for apple pay by you wait she's being real she thought it was like cash back

you know spending so much time on my phone uh giving my data very freely and willingly to

any place that asks like whatever they say are cookies okay i say yes yes yes because i thought

that's how i was getting prizes getting rewards getting apple dollars so i didn't think that was

real money till i checked my credit card bill i i've been spending money like i'm a freaking

millionaire i got hair moves

i'm straight hair my hair doesn't even hold loose i call apple to straighten things out

i look at it as i please speak with mr steve jobs they go he's no longer with us

this may be fake i'm sure it probably is but there are people that legitimately think this way

i'm not even kidding you there are people you you think that this is completely

you think that this is a joke there's not you think there aren't people that think this way

do you know what i'm saying i'm not kidding you i'm not kidding you i'm not kidding you i'm not

kidding you i'm not kidding you i'm not kidding you i'm not kidding you i'm not kidding you

how many people pay the minimum balance on the date due date for their credit card

because they think that's what they have to pay in order to not get charged interest

minimum due i did a video explaining the difference between statement balance current

balance and and and uh due date and how to avoid that eight million views okay

there are a lot of younger people out there who get credit cards for the first time

and don't understand the difference between statement balance current balance and due date

and don't understand that there is interest attached to it.

They just don't.

They think it's like a debit card.

I'm borrowing money from myself.

I can pay back later.

It's like giving myself a loan.

They don't understand until they finally,

after months and months and months,

their credit card is shut down and they get a bill

and they owe twice what they spent

because the interest started going up.

That is not a joke.

That is a massive thing that happens.

Okay?

This is true.

Okay?

This is a true thing that happens.

It may be uncomfortable.

Okay?

All right, what else we got here?

I don't know if Superman was able to fix the Ro Khanna channel in Discord.

Guys, don't forget, Ro Khanna is going to be here on Monday.

Okay?

On stream around noon.

So I'm going to be asking him a set of questions.

I got him for like 30 to 45 minutes.

So if you have any questions you would like for me to ask,

obviously, I'm not going to ask your stupid ones,

related to congressional stuff, oversight, budgeting,

you know, inside.

You know, inside.

You know, inside.

You know, congressional insider trading,

even maybe Epstein list,

stuff since he's the co-sponsor of the bill.

We'll talk about it.

So make sure that you're here for that.

Okay?

All right, let's see what else we got here.

Welcome, MNTLXX, to the Bear Gang.

All right, what is this?

Okay, here we go.

Stocky, are you still in stub?

If so, I think you should continue to hold or take calls.

Okay?

Because of what?

Because of this?

Am I in stub?

Like, stub hub?

Yes.

Oh, there's a link.

Okay.

Can, is, oh, sorry.

Is this bullish for stub?

Okay, let's see.

What is it?

I should not speak.

If I speak, I will be in trouble, so I will not speak.

Go back?

Guys, come on.

Stunning, hands down.

Oh, God.

Would put a bracelet on it right now.

Oh, my God.

What the fuck?

Wait, how'd she push record?

Oh, no, no, no.

Please, guys.

What is this?

She is never going to check my cell phone, so that's a yes for me.

Oh, my God.

Hear me out.

Arm job going to go crazy.

How do you wipe?

So, I guess a hand job is out of the question.

Oh, Lord have mercy.

Hands off?

Okay.

What's her only hands?

Oh, no.

Oh, God.

Look, Ma, no hands.

How does she wipe, though?

Oh, my God.

I'm not reading these out loud.

No.

Okay.

All right.

You guys need help.

All right.

What else we got here from you guys?

All right.

Here we go.

Let's open it up.

This is why we need to raise rates, Stocky.

What are your thoughts on this?

What is it?

What is this?

Another influencer thing?

This is a video or a picture?

Today, I'm flying to Kuwait.

As usual, I'm running late, so I take my husband's car to the airport.

Oh, here we go.

Okay.

All right.

Well, here we go.

We got some Middle Eastern money.

All right.

I'm taking my husband's Bugatti.

Okay.

But then this happened.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

No fuel in Bugatti.

I left the car on the side of the road, and I got the driver to pick me up.

Baby, we left your car.

It's fine.

I have a one-hour flight, so I get my hair done and breakfast on the way.

As soon as I land, I get my makeup done and have the first shoot.

Today, I have collaborations with the clinic, salons, and makeup brands.

Kuwait is one of my favorite places.

It's like one of those day in the life of for somebody, but for them, it's just a...

It's an amazing place with a lot of opportunity for women.

I've never been in business, but the best part about Kuwait...

Kuwaiti food, but in a traditional way.

Then, business done.

I meet up with my sister.

It's like...

You guys know what poverty tourism is?

You guys have heard of poverty tourism, right?

Where people with money will go to poverty-stricken areas to see how they live and live like them?

That was what that Kuwaiti thing was, the food thing.

This stream?

Fuck you.

My sister in the mall took some pictures with my fans.

With my fans?

We're going back home.

Bye, guys.

Hopefully, you enjoyed the longest day of my...

She got a...

Today?

She got a trunk, though.

All right.

Well, I don't...

Listen.

Money is different in different places.

Somebody who is...

Somebody who lives in...

For example, in rural India, looks at your middle-class life the same way that you're

looking at this person.

I guess it's all about perspective.

I'm not even...

I'm not even, like, you know, giving anybody a pass, but it's so funny how we see that.

You know what I mean?

Like, everyone's, you know, perspective is so different.

It's just weird.

Just think about that.

If you did, like, a day in your life, there are people that...

Does that mean a Qatari military will have troops on the ground in the USA?

What?

I don't know what you're talking about.

You sent me another one, too?

Guys, I can't do these fucking day-in-the-life shits all day.

This doesn't even make any sense.

What is this?

How much...

Just a girl...

How much I spend living in Miami.

God.

Jesus, she's a...

I thought she was wearing pants.

Never mind.

How much I spend living in Miami.

How much it actually costs being a girl living in Miami.

Uh-oh.

Here we go.

All right.

Here's what I spend being a girl living in Miami.

My rent is $13,000, but my man pays for it, so it's free.

Oh.

All right.

We're going to get through this together, guys.

We're going to get through this together.

Okay?

I have three gym memberships.

I don't know why, but my man pays for two of them.

The other one is $200 a month for my Pilates classes, which I always schedule and forget

to show up to.

Obviously, body contouring, because we need to be invisible and not...

What is this thing with people just taking a fucking rolling pin and rubbing it on their

stomach?

This reminds me, and I'm guilty of buying one of these when I was like a teenager.

There was this contraption you used to buy.

There was this contraption you used to buy, and it was a shocker.

And it was a...

You would...

Oh, God.

Maybe not now.

It doesn't matter.

So, what you would do is you would put this belt thing on your stomach, and it would have

like six different little metal things.

And you would put it on there, and it would send little electric shocks to each of your

abs, and it was supposed to stimulate them to make the muscles stronger, and it would

give you abs.

It was such a stupid fucking thing, but everyone believed it.

Is that what we're doing here?

We're just rubbing...

We're just like damaging skin cells or something?

What are we doing?

What is this?

Okay?

This is just like a very like strong massage.

This is like getting some like some Eastern European fucking, you know, farmer to give

you a fucking deep tissue massage with his fucking leathery hands.

You know what I mean?

Like, I don't get what this is.

That's about $800 a month.

I take peptides and supplements, and that's around $833 a month.

Just eat a fucking salad.

Jesus Christ.

The amount of people that spend $1,000 a month on this.

The amount of people that spend $1,000 a month on this.

The amount of people that spend $1,000 a month on this.

The amount of people that spend $1,000 a month on fucking supplements could just eat

a goddamn salad.

Like, eat some fucking carrots, some broccoli, maybe some fucking asparagus, some green beans,

some beets maybe.

I don't know, man.

Like, some lima beans.

Like, what are you doing, man?

Just go out.

Go to the fucking farmer's market and get some goddamn vegetables.

You ain't gotta buy.

You ain't gotta take all these supplements.

Like, what are we doing, guys?

Why you...

Beets and meat?

Shut up, Daniela.

Like, I don't even get it.

Okay?

You know?

It's like, well, I don't have time to make all that.

Well, then get a fucking juicer, throw it in there, and fucking juice it up.

Hold your breath and drink it.

Same thing you do when you take fucking fireball shots on the weekend.

Oh, I'm so healthy with my body.

That weekend's just Jager bombs.

This is so crazy.

Tomorrow morning, we're doing mimosas, then we're doing margaritas, and then tequila shots.

Ah, crazy.

Like, shut the fuck up.

Okay?

What are you talking about?

All right?

Mix some fucking juice in your fucking...

Tequila and take a shot of it.

Okay?

Like, literally, that's all you've gotta do.

Like, what are you doing a thousand dollars...

Have you all never heard of fucking vegetables?

Like, I don't get it.

I need zinc.

All right?

Eat some fucking...

Eat some fucking, you know, spinach.

Yeah, but I also need some magnesium.

Okay, well, just eat some fucking, like, almonds or some shit.

But I also need calcium.

Okay, well, there's almonds.

Well, I also need potassium.

You ever heard of a banana?

Well, yeah, but what about my folic acid?

There's, like, 80 vegetables.

Like, just fucking make a juicer.

I'm sorry.

I'm blacking out over people getting supplements.

I just don't get it.

Thank you for doing this.

It's a distraction from my bleeding of my portfolio.

I'm sorry.

And you're not a girl living in Miami if you don't take hot girl walk.

What the fuck is a hot girl walk?

Is a four-mile walk where you think about three things.

Yes.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

I'm just trying to shut the fuck up.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

What the fuck?

What the fuck is a hot girl walk?

Viral.

I'm going for a walk.

I just want to focus on positive self-ambitions, goals, and gratitude.

I'm going to leave in a few minutes.

Do you have to be hot to take a hot girl walk?

Or is it like hot yoga?

It has to be hot outside.

All right, babe.

Since you're hot.

um huh you're not hot what are you sexy what do you want me to call you you need to start taking

a hot girl walk okay hot girl walk is an outdoor walk for four miles you focus on internal thoughts

and positive affirmations not physical appearance gratitude goals and confidence good things

willingly don't i know that i wish my wife forfeited her ass a little bit more willing

you can make it five miles i won't mind hey we should round up women against their

against their will tie them to fucking tables and breathe them against their i'm not gonna do this

context thing every day all right i learned something today she doesn't look like she's

thinking about internal instead of external like whatever just free i mean unless i stop to get

like a matcha or coffee three hundred dollar cough which is always so that ends up being three hundred

dollars a month and then obviously food because even though we always serve we still have to eat

but that's two thousand dollars a month we always serve what

fuck

i feed six people in this house for a thousand dollars a month because i go through a meal prep

service i get my nails done at least twice a month which is three she could save a lot of

money i'm not sponsored anymore hundred dollars i recommend buying class pass because you'd get

really good deals on there my shopping budget is five thousand dollars a month what do you do with

all that shit you live in an apartment you're spending five thousand a month on shopping what

the fuck do you do with all that when my man is being cheap but it's whatever i usually end up

spending more

and makeup for date nights that's usually around i'm gonna be real with you i'm not like i'm not

talking about physical appearance i'm just saying based on her personality she got it there's

something she's doing i don't want to say it out loud but definitely there's something that she's

doing that that is keeping this this around because two hundred dollars a month and then

lastly bottle service but i just pay with my face card and that's how much it costs being a girl

living in miami

that's how much it costs you having your side piece that lives in miami for her silence

i'm sorry i'm not being a dick i'm not being a dick but that's what it costs that is what you

pay for the silence okay that's why when your neighbor okay when you're when the when the

neighbors when their family all of a sudden buys the babysitter a fucking brand new car right let

me tell you something that that's not because they're thanking the babysitter you know you know

whatever i mean you know whatever i mean you know whatever i mean you know whatever i mean you know

i would love to be your guide okay i i can't i don't know what to tell you here i'm not i'm still

stuck up on the hot girl walk thing can guys take hot girl walks hot guy walks but if we said hot

guy walk we would get called misogynistic and like self-centered so we can't do that all right um

okay i have no idea what this has to do with uh since we were talking about books and libraries

earlier what does that have to do with anything you can't trust everybody but you can't trust the

new grill public library to give you access or access to the new grill public library

free to hundreds of books great programming and resources you can't trust everybody but you can't

trust the new grill public library to give you access or free oh no

oh that's great oh that's great that's how that's how marketing should be done

oh man that's absolutely insane

thank you thank you

oh that's good all right i'm almost done here i'm just going through the list of things that

you guys have sent me i know we're not doing stocks right now but it's friday what is this

record high

record high

house prices record highs household debt record high interest rate cuts oh yeah could this end

badly how do you mean too much debt and overvalued assets what it's just that historically things do

not yeah oh there's an ad for somebody else okay that's fair you just send me somebody's ad i need

a month-long yolo funny enough i actually took the interest the fed not cutting interest rates

this next month as my yolo i'm not cutting interest rates this next month as my yolo

i know there's a it's almost impossible but they said they're going to do two interest rate cuts by

the end of the year and most people think the second two more with three months to go everybody

thinks that this month is going to be the next one and they probably will but it's like

9.1 to 0.9 almost nine to one odds that they'll do they won't do they'll just keep it no no change

this month so i was like fuck it that that's why not right all right i gotta do although i'll do

one more and then see if there's anything else and then i gotta get going because i pick up my

daughter we're up on a lot of shit today though cat x is still those you guys still in the middle of the

there uh nvx has absolutely crushed it you you was crushing it our divvies are holding up pretty

well we did pretty well considering the market's getting absolutely fucking like shit on right now

that's why i gotta buy my calls before the end of the day for the weekend you're up a nickel on max

well bro listen let me tell you something right now if you don't own max you're a fucking bitch

let's just let's i don't make the rules all right what's this all right first check-in i've done in

a very long time it's not gonna be a good one today

is thursday july 17th 2025 and i am sitting in the most amount of drawdown that i've ever been in

july july 17th that's right here what the fuck how are you that was a new all-time high what

i traded 40 contracts an amount that i've traded before but the difference between this time and

the last time is i broke my rules this time the last time i traded with 40 contracts i took my

loss it is what it is it was my biggest loss

i think it was 28 or 27 000 and that was it that was my first time experimenting with 40 contracts

um i tried it again this time but this time i broke my rules and i couldn't solidify my loss

and i didn't want to solidify my loss and i held and now we're sitting in 200 000 worth of drawdown

with the potential for this to keep going that hurts before any y'all judge i want you to look

at a position that was a day trade once that you held

and didn't sell it because it was a loss or it was down for the day and you said i'll just hold it

overnight and you held it overnight and then it dropped down the next day five percent so you

decide i'm gonna buy a little bit more for the bounce back and it didn't and then it kept falling

and you kept buying and kept buying and you have so much goddamn capital in it now and you still

can't let it go and it's still red in your portfolio you just can't let it go so before

you fucking judge this woman i know you're out there too okay you mean like mnts mnts all right

motherfuckers i'll see y'all in a month just to add on to that i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna

insult to injury so i'll get scalded on the internet i'm bummed i broke my rules man

paying the price literally that is all the work i put in this year dissolved in one trade

crazy i was at 200 000 for half the year coming into july two hundred thousand dollars worth of

profits i took some losses even had my biggest loss here's the problem though and this is why

it's dangerous for this girl notice how she says i haven't cut

it at two hundred thousand dollar loss i broke my rules i'm now down two hundred thousand with

the potential for more you are now break even on the year fuck it you fucked up you said you

weren't gonna do it again you did it again maybe the second time's a charm you're done cut it

fucking cut it doesn't cut it continues to go down more but still is doing really well still

abiding by my rules even though i was experimenting with bigger contract sizes and bigger positions

i made a mistake but i'm gonna keep making it like y'all y'all said never stick your dick in

crazy but you keep going back this time broke the rules man or ladies you know who you got on that

roster and you're not supposed to text him again you're supposed to delete his number but you just

renamed him to like pizza hut or some shit all right first checking out that's rough but i'll

be honest with you i don't know what happens but the market if she was long the market she probably

did good you know what's crazy

i have a feeling i don't know who this has never seen it before but i have a feeling

she probably stayed in this got her money back or maybe even profited and that's the worst fucking

thing that could happen to her the worst fucking thing i don't know if she have a page i could

check if she stayed in that and it came back and it actually worked out that's actually the worst

fucking thing she could have ever done because instead of learning something from it it reinforces

that well next time maybe i'll do it again

i just timed it bad she got out of the trade up 90 000 oh no wait no no no no no no no no no no no

really oh she sells a course okay not saying anything about that right now because i don't

want to get into the fucking my wife told me not to get any more beef right now until after twitch

con today is wednesday july 30th 2025 well currently i'm in my trade so i've been patient

and draw down i gotta be patient and okay i'm not gonna do all this right now i'll talk about it

i don't want to encourage anybody speaking of which i'm gonna try futures trading for the first

time ever in a couple weeks some company reached out to me that does um they do a futures trading

thing and they do like one of those whatever and i was like yeah i'll i want to give it a shot i'll

give it a shot fuck it what all right and um it's one of those demo accounts that like you know if

you do well whatever you know you can you can eventually use real money whatever and they i

talked to them they seem like a pretty pretty fucking good company pretty good legit people

but that's not why i wanted to do it it's because i've never tried futures trading everybody says

my lines always seem to work and i'm like well i'm gonna give it a shot for real so we'll see

you're doing a prop firm no not exactly not exactly i don't do prop firms it's a little

bit different than that interactive brokers aren't you options trading the future well

yes and no um it's more so i just want to kind of like i've never done it before and

you know when you don't know something you want to give it a shot and i was gonna i wanted to

practice on my own but they're like i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know
