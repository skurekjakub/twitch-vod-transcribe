Hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good happy frickin Friday

I think we all need a Friday right now, huh?

All right, let's run it. Let's run it you DJs. All right, let's go

Wrong song YouTube

Wrong song that's not the right day. Who's the old man in the bottom, right? The guy dicking down your mom. Shut up

for two months

Northern Delaware is supposed to get 12 to 18 inches of snow before Christmas just a heads-up Delawareans cannot drive in the snow

Thank you. Oh good morning. Tasty beef curtains. How you doing today?

Is your wife okay with you talking about other moms

What a stupid fucking question if my wife wasn't okay with it. I wouldn't do it

Yeah, you would know there's things that I have done in the past that my wife has asked me not to do and I don't

Do it anymore. You just don't know it because I don't make a fucking big deal

Out of it. Oh

Which earnings did you take?

Figma calls

Apparently Google's taking a stake

Sound and DraftKings Oh DraftKings was not a good one

Is Oscar a buy?

Yeah, but their CEO might be

needing extra security

Guys every day that the government shutdown goes on

The more deleveraging we're gonna see

Although we did just get an announcement that the Senate is thinking about an alternative proposal

So we'll see if spy calls it over

There you go

Didn't you draw a line on spy yesterday?

I think I did it have to look and see I don't know

Tick-tock he knew about tick-tock before we did. All right, let's go spy calls it open, right?

All right, ding ding ding ding ding let's see what happens

Did I draw a line yesterday? Oh I did

Okay. Well run it run it

on Tuesday

All right, so I am in a AON and I am in five in this morning

These are two I'm in who who is also very interesting to us right now

So we've got we've got that going on

five in because of the all of the the the news with the cash flow and the buyback and

AON because of the backlog that they have so I'm running those two right now

and then

keeping an eye on

Can you explain the red and green line for someone new to this?

So this red and green line basically for whatever time frame you're looking at like this is one minute every one minute

Green means it opened at the bottom of the line and closed at the top of the line meaning it went up and

Red means it opened at the top of the line and closed at the at that minute at the bottom line and it went down

that much so like for example, this is the

S&P 500 in this one minute it opened up at six sixty seven ninety three and

closed down at six sixty six fifty eight

so that means it was a

Down, right? So red top to bottom open to close

Green bottom to top open to close and it's it's obviously a loss or a gain

How do we make it stop zoom out you dipshits?

Look at this

Alright, so we do have move LRN moving pretty nicely here. We got Divvy's looking okay this morning

We got a little bit of a rotation into there. Just remember something guys

This money that's leaving the market doesn't really have anywhere to go

It's gonna be sitting on the sidelines and nobody wants to keep their money in cash

so everybody's gonna be waiting for the next opportunity to buy whether it's from the

Government shutdown or whatnot. So when we do have a rebound, it's probably gonna be kind of violent

But the question is is how long do we go and the longer we have this government shutdown the more concern there is we're getting

You know ten to thirty billion dollars a day in GDP losses right now, but it's more importantly

Focusing on the travel side of it and we got announcements. We talked to the call this morning that

At Harry Reid Airport. They actually just shut down the airport. They did a ground-haul and

UAL a deal are canceling more and more flights. All right, what do we got?

Moving right now Walmart calls doing well Chewy doing well

Long time no see new house. Yes new house new state

new trailer

New trailer who this?

New state before GTA 6. Yes, I'm aware

You're a little bit late on that on that joke, but it's cool. I used to live in a trailer. I don't miss it

I don't think that

never mind

Tempersite flight cancel at 40 major airports is super concerning and if our children just double stress with no income and bills piling up

true story

true story when I um,

come on five and when I

joined the military

my

My ASVAB scores like my I have my found my old report cards from like middle school in high school where it's like I failed

Like the semester but then like passed the final exam and gave me a D for the year

It's because I hated doing homework. I just did I forgot to do it. I wasn't interested. I got busy doing something else

But my ASVAB scores were like, you know, 98 99 whatever

So when I got to MEPS, they said you could you could choose anything?

you want the highest you had to have was a 68 for

geophysics in the Air Force, right and like so I could choose anything

I wanted and my first choice was air traffic controller air traffic controller and I thought to myself

What a good job this would be I could be an air traffic controller from the age of 18 to 22

get out of the military go straight to be an air traffic controller making six figures and this was like early 2000s and

Worked for 25 years and be retired and then later on in life

I learned how shitty being an air traffic controller really is, like, depending on where you're at.

And I got screwed out of what I wanted to do because my first job was air traffic controller.

My second was combat satellite systems operator, which is thank God for the national defense in the world that I wasn't there.

I forgot the other two.

And then my last one, I didn't have anything.

I said, I don't have anything.

The guy goes, just put open general.

You're going to get your first or second choice at worst case.

So I said, okay, I went open general.

Well, we were in the middle of two wars.

We had just invaded Iraq, and we'd been two years in Afghanistan.

So what did they do?

Threw me in the fucking front lines, right?

So that kind of fucked up.

But looking back, it might have been a good thing because if I was an air traffic controller, I'd be in the end of my career right now.

But Jesus Christ, the way I – and especially because I ended up becoming an alcoholic.

Now, that would have been tough.

You know what I mean?

Did you have to retake the ASVAB?

No, I got 99 in – I got 99, 98, 99.

98, 98.

So I don't remember what the thing was, but this was years ago.

And we've been talking about dumping because the government shut down or something else.

Well, we are dumping – remember, when you're trying to guess why the market's falling,

the problem is is that people who tell you they know why the market's falling are full of shit.

The thing is is that markets fall because more people are selling than buying, right?

Very simple concept.

Why are people selling?

Why are firms or positions being sold?

That could be a million different reasons.

And sometimes people sell.

They sell for a different reason, and it causes other sells because when you're this high up

and everybody's on edge about everything, the chances of a sell-off, like a short-term sell-off,

are much higher because everybody's like on edge, right?

Like it's like, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

You know, like, oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

I don't want to be so risky.

I need an excuse to de-risk or de-leverage a little bit.

And it kind of follows through.

The government shut down, in my opinion, as I said, for me personally, when the shutdown started,

I wasn't concerned.

I wasn't concerned.

I'm like, ah, fuck it.

We do this all the time.

But I told you, if it gets to 30 days, I'm going to start getting worried because that's

when actual essential services start messing up.

And more importantly, first paychecks are missed.

And we got there.

Air traffic control and flights, that is going to be insane.

And we already talked about it yesterday.

31 million people travel in the holidays, are expected to travel this holiday, and over

a trillion dollars in consumer spending for the holiday season.

You're putting that at risk.

So there's going to be people out there and firms or large, large, large holders or even

retail traders are going to be like, you know what?

I'm up a lot this year, and I might scale out.

And scaling out 5% of your positions doesn't sound like a lot.

But when you're talking about a trillion dollars in equity, it's a lot.

You see what I mean?

So every day that the government shutdown goes on, there's more and more concern that

we're going to get more and more disruptions of flights and spending and a lot of concerns

there.

And so it gives people a reason to deleverage, de-risk a little bit.

But we are in extreme fear, despite the fact that we're near all-time high.

And the people selling have cash on the sidelines.

Some of it's rotating into dividends, as you can see above there.

We're seeing some rotation.

But that cash in this environment has nowhere, you don't have anywhere to go with it.

You can't leave it in cash because you're absolutely going to get destroyed on dollar.

I mean, the dollar's up, you know, three-month high right now, but the dollar's still devaluing.

Inflation's not slowing down.

Crypto is too volatile for a lot, too new for a lot of people.

Housing is too expensive.

Bonds are paying shit.

So what does that mean?

That means the first opportunity people have to take that cash.

Cash on the sidelines and get back in, they're going to fucking dive back in.

So if we get an announcement that a deal is being met because of how much shit is going

to get from this whole travel thing, I think we're going to have a violent jump to the upside.

The question is, is how long does that last?

Treasury bills?

I mean, T-bills are still paying somewhat good, but T-bills aren't nearly what they

were before.

I mean, you know, short-term.

Because you don't want to stick yourself in a one-year treasury when, you know, the market

is gaining, you know.

15%, even with this pullback, we're at 14% in the year, right?

Nobody wants to sit in that unless they're looking for, like, very low risk.

But it's not really an attractive model right now, especially looking back on the market.

What would you buy right now on the dip?

Are you talking about for the long term?

Jimmy Pissfinger's just resubbed for $17.

I mean, Google's not going anywhere.

SoFi's not going anywhere.

What's a good way to do that while keeping my kidneys and my car?

Is Poet dead?

I don't know.

We have.

Poet, like, three weeks ago.

Helen of Troy doing pretty good here.

Something's going on.

All right.

What do we got moving here?

It's doing pretty good.

Have you heard of Zcash?

Say a three-month high from $9 to $6.47.

I have no clue about this crypto and figured I might just ask you.

No, I don't keep up with all that, man.

Just not my thing.

There's always something new.

There goes AAON waiting for 5N to move.

Hoohoo's not really moving.

FI is moving right now.

The only two plays I took this morning were 5N and AAON.

Ooh, okay, FI.

Give me something here.

Give me something here.

All right.

Funny enough, our Chewy calls have been outperforming significantly.

Look at this.

So my wife hasn't said anything to me, but I was looking at this right here,

and we took Chewy.

Chewy leaps last week, and versus the S&P 500 for the past five days.

Okay.

Thanks, Chewy.

I love how my wife comes to me.

She's like, Chewy hasn't moved much in the past few days.

It's only up like 2%.

I'm like, look at the S&P 500.

Oh.

Are we doing the GPUS thing again?

Is it under 36?

All right.

Come on, AAON.

Give me that fucking, give me that money.

All right.

5N.

I'm going to have to grab a little bit more there.

I don't want to marry a play there.

But I think 5N is going to have a good reversal here today.

I mean, I'm not confident enough that I'm going to take fucking zero-day calls on it.

But what was the last stock Mrs. Stocky bought?

She listened to me and didn't buy Chipotle.

Thank God.

It got killed again.

The last stock she bought was Chewy.

All right.

O doing nicely.

MO up 1%.

VTR, Walmart's green.

Chewy's nicely green.

AbbVie's up.

Verizon's up.

Intel's up.

Google down 2%.

NNE down another 7%.

You know what that means for me.

Yeah, we're going to go over some of the stuff that we talked about today.

Do I still invest in SoFi?

I mean, SoFi is the kind of stock where you, in my opinion, that you just put like a reoccurring buy on.

You know, you buy like, you know, one share a day or something like that.

Or, you know, 100 bucks a week or something like that.

Because it's going to go through those cycles up and down.

You know, and the market kind of deleverages and de-risks.

SoFi is going to be one of the ones that get beat up the most, right?

Because it's still new.

It's fintech and whatnot.

And obviously finance is there.

But we just saw that debt is continuing to go up.

I mean, I talked about it this morning with the increase.

It's insane.

Student debt is like $1.6 trillion now and 10% of it's delinquent.

Hey, there we go.

AON is moving.

Let's go.

Are you still in fly shares?

No.

What are your thoughts on Oscar?

I was a fan of Oscar back in 2021 because they offered health insurance coverage to gig workers.

And so many people were becoming gig workers post-COVID.

But when the whole, you know, spec and growth sector exploded in 2022, it took a while to recover.

I think Oscar is a sleeper in the health care sector.

I know there's a lot of concern about the ACA being stripped out with the subsidies, with the BBB.

But this Democrat election kind of like landslide that happened shows that there's a better chance that we see the normal situation where the House or the Senate flips during the midterms.

And with that, it's going to slow down a lot of the gutting of the ACA.

And so the subsidies might not be as bad.

The stripping out is as anticipated.

Oscar, on the other hand, is really big for, you know, younger people.

It's not like lemonade, you know, but it's better for younger people, for people that are visiting here.

My in-laws are on Oscar Health.

The thing is, though, is that they're kind of that CEO needs to get some security.

I'm going to be real with you and I'll tell you why.

They announced that their revenue was up 23% year over year so far this year and then announced that they're going to increase prices by 28%.

Next year.

Hey, chat, it's good to be here.

F out of here.

I've never seen chat so market focused on a Friday morning.

Part of the reason is, is because the market is there's a lot of uncertainty right now and everybody's scared that there's a bubble bursting and this is the end.

Also, because lately we've been way Friday mornings.

Fridays used to be the most degenerate day of the of the week and it's become the most like locked in informative, like stock finance talk day of the week.

I think it's just because all the shit that I didn't get to.

During the week, I'm trying to, like, get to get through it.

Oh, my God.

What did I write down yesterday?

Yo, let's go.

A.O.N.

That was our fucking main play today.

I love that shit.

All right.

Grab 30 shares this morning.

Cancel gym pay mortgage.

Oh, OK.

I got to get rid of all my pens.

Do you not shower?

I do.

That's why most of it's gone.

But it's a it was on me all day.

So pay my mortgage to thanks, bro.

I'm paying rent here, which is like nearly.

Double what my mortgage is, utilities and shit like that.

I ain't paying your shit either.

Amazon default delivery address before it happens.

Yeah, I did that yesterday.

All right.

A.O.N.

Is looking really good right now.

That was a good, good play this morning.

A.O.N.

A lot of it had to do with the backlog that we talked about.

Plus, I think A.O.N.

Five is not moving well yet.

I think with A.O.N., there might be a sleeper when it comes to data centers there.

They do industrial HVACs.

And those data centers.

They do industrial HVACs.

Those data centers are going to have to get cooled.

And so I'm really curious to see, you know, do they do they end up expanding more into that down the line?

Obviously, I have no idea.

But but that's that's something I'm going to be watching.

What's up, buddy?

What's up?

What's up, good boy?

What's up?

You need some attention?

Yeah.

Yeah.

You're a good boy.

You're a good boy.

You want a treat?

You want a treat?

Great carpet back there, man.

I have the same one after my grand great grandparents passed.

Soviet occupation that occurred in Poland.

It's not my rug, dude.

Was time zone a factor in moving to Delaware?

No, it's the it's the same.

It's the same time zone.

But it feels like a different world.

Let's go chewy because, man, it gets dark so fucking early here.

Let's go chewy because, man, it gets dark so fucking early here.

Okay, I love you too.

Okay, you can't have too many treats.

You just had your chemo drugs.

You've got to make sure that you do okay, okay?

You're a good boy.

You're a good boy, come.

You're not that old yet.

No more treats, no more treats.

You can't have too many treats, okay?

Although, we live really close to a high school, so I opened up the door last night to let him out.

And I heard like, boom, boom, boom.

I'm like, shit, we're under attack.

And then I was like, oh.

And then I heard the marching band.

And I was like, oh, shit, there's a football game.

And I was like, I should go there.

I love football games.

I love high school football games.

But then, you know, I was like, maybe it would be weird.

Of course you live close to a high school you pervert.

Am I about to ban somebody?

You can't do that shit, bro.

That's a little bit weird.

It's a little bit fucking weird.

It's a little too far.

You're turning into a little bit too far.

I'm not gonna ban him, no.

I think he was trying to make a joke.

He just fucked up the way he said it.

Alright, let's get back to it.

Alright, so, we did get an announcement at the last minute

that potentially or apparently

the Senate is

yo, A-A-O-N, we fucking nailed it.

That the Senate may be coming up with an alternative

plan

to reopen. How much of that I believe,

I don't really know at this point.

You know, I feel like anybody

leaking anything out there before the weekend

is, you know,

I don't want to take

their word for it right now

with the credibility of how everybody's

trying to jockey for position right now.

Hey Stocky, the NFL is

looking for a new field. Is your forehead available?

Well, apparently it was funny.

I was like, damn.

I thought that was a miss, but chat liked it.

Um.

I'm trying to answer somebody's question.

I can't see it. There's, OBS has not let me scroll

up anymore. How's the switch up from

Miramar feeling? It was Pembroke Pines.

I'm, I'm, I'm,

man, I like

change and stuff like that, but sometimes

there's a sudden change, like the cold weather is cool

and, um, the colonial

houses are nice and it feels like I'm in

that like, that like movie, the American

you know, like American Dream kind of movie where it's like

brick houses and, and

you know, and they got the yard and it's down the clean

street and everybody's got the nice, you know, whatever.

I mean, that's nice and all, but like

it is legitimately fucking

night time at 4pm up here.

I, I, I, like,

we usually take our walks down there

at 6.30

when it's like getting twilight.

Not in the summer. At 6.30 the sun's still way up.

It's like twilight at 6, 6.30

and we take our walks and

then, you know, come back and eat dinner

or eat dinner and take our walk. And here I was

like, we, we, we were cooking dinner at

5 o'clock and it was like pitch black out.

That's called winter? Yeah, winter

up here. Remember, in Florida

the sun is higher in the sky. Here

the fucking noon

the fucking sun is right here on the horizon.

Right? It's not up

there. So there, you know,

you know, ten minutes before

sundown it's still sunny out because the sun's

you know, going this way. Over here that shit's like

later fuckers.

It's like you just got here.

Yeah. I'm here for,

I'm here for a good time, not a long time.

What the fuck was that?

Don't you high and weeb shit me.

Speaking of weeb shit,

what is this Golden song? My kids

won't stop singing it. They used

to sing that, uh, that, that

uh, uh, uh, that, that, what is it?

APT song. Now they're singing this

fucking shit, like

don't get me wrong,

like in the car when they, when I play it

they ask me to play it over and over again and like when my daughter's

jamming, the first two times I'll be like

going up, up, but like

it's like, they're just, and then my son

they're both yelling from the back seat, again,

again, again.

It's like the showers you pay for. Okay, bro.

I'm gonna make them listen to this version here.

I'm gonna make them listen to

the Queen version of it.

We're going up, up, up

it's our mode. You know together

we're glowing. Gonna be,

gonna be golden. Now

I'm shining like I'm

going to be. We're

What? Okay.

I don't know what's going on with Fi, but my calls are doing well.

Is Spy bouncing yet?

Alright. Spy look, I think Spy's gonna take off.

AAON is fucking killing it.

Waiting for Fi to

rebound, if they do.

I don't have a stop loss yet. I have a second

order that should get filled.

Oh, it did get filled!

Okay, I had it for $19.99. It filled at $19.97.

So that's not actually, I guess it fell

so much on that candle. Okay. Alright, now I'm putting

my stop loss in. I was wondering

it didn't update. Damn, it got all the way down to

$19.70? Okay.

I think we're gonna bounce here.

I do think we're gonna bounce here.

Again,

it's completely just a fucking gut feeling here,

but I'm not saying for the rest of the day, but

it's really setting up right now, and

with that leak of that news, whether it's true

or not, if there's confirmation of it, we could

see a spike. Alright, where we at?

Alright, I'm gonna put my stop loss

here for Fi in at half of it

at 2%, half of it at 4%.

Half at 2%,

half at 4%.

No, not 1%. Schwab, stop

that shit. Stop that shit.

I gotta leave this platform.

TOS is just not doing it for me anymore.

They just can't. It just doesn't

register the stop loss.

That's right, Bayo. Let him know. Who is it?

Get him, Bayo. Get him.

Alright, there we go. Alright, it's doing it again.

Why can't you just

give it to me the way I want it?

Okay, there we go. Okay.

Hello, my loves. Hello, Stalky.

The new house looks nice so far. I'm in a

basement. AON's still

going. I like this for a potential long.

I'm really curious to see how they do with

the... Oh, there

it goes. There it goes. There it goes. Let's go.

Now, again, I drew this line yesterday

for a month out, so please do not pay

attention to it, okay?

But

I do want to keep an eye

on it. Apparently, there's a leak that's come out

that the Senate is proposing a

potential

change or a potential, you know, like

alternative for

the shutdown. I don't know.

I don't know. Why the fuck is

Albemarle and why is it flying?

Were you not in the call this morning, bro?

Did you not see what the announcement

this morning? The US has added copper, silver,

and uranium to the critical minerals list.

My wife is proposing to me? Congratulations,

bro. I'm sorry. My wife

is proposing to leave me for her

boss. Oh. Fuck it.

Let her go, bro. Congrats, bro.

That's also a congrats. You know

why? Because by her telling

you she's leaving you for a boss, it's a lot easier

than finding out that they're, you know, finding

out a different way. It doesn't feel

like it now, but as you get older,

you'll start wishing people would just

fucking be honest with you. It's like, listen,

you don't like me. You fell

out of love with me. You're attracted to somebody else.

Alright. Just tell me before

I find out the other way because

it hurts when you find out somebody

doesn't want to be with you anymore. It hurts

a lot more when they've been pretending to love

you and fucking the shit out of somebody behind

your back in your own goddamn bed.

And then you look back and say

every time she came home

and kissed you on the lips, she had just sucked

another man's dick. Okay, bro, not

the time for Coldplay. You're

not helping? Do you necessarily

know why he said

that to me? Because he knows I'm the one guy

out there who's gonna tell him straight up. I'm not

gonna fucking pussyfoot around

shit. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. I'm just gonna tell him how

it is. Oh, you mean the congrats

part. Oh, okay.

Are you okay?

Uh, Mike

Johnson shot down the talk saying he wouldn't

bend. That's surprising. He's bent

over a lot. I don't know if that guy followed

up. I lost his comment. I've never

been this down on stocks before. It hurts

so bad. Are you new?

What stocks are you in?

Unless you're in like Open Door or you're brand

new to the market, this is just, this is

bro, zoom out. Look at this.

I mean, this is, this is

this is basically the same pullback

that we had 30 days ago.

We had this exact same pullback

percentage-wise a month

ago. That's why dollar cost averaging

is so important.

Finished telling your story to the therapist, Daco? What

story? Bayo, the reason I

the reason I haven't worn my wedding

ring in four years, five years,

is because

when my wife and I were to, were, were

in bed, laying down at night

to watch TV or whatever, Bayo would

sleep with us and he would lick my ring non-stop

and it would get, it would, it would make it

like this, what he's doing right now,

and it would slip off and fall and I was afraid

I was gonna lose it. So I took off my wedding

ring and I put it on my

side table. And every

time I would put it back on, he would do the same thing. So one day

I just put it in a little bowl and forgot.

And because I spent 30 years of my life, or

35 years of my life not wearing a wedding

ring, after a few weeks you just totally

forget. It's not like something that you're, you're like

you feel like you're missing.

And then I thought, and then after like a year

or two, and then we had the kids and everything like that, and then one day I was like

what the fuck ever happened to my wedding ring?

Because in Indian culture they don't, they don't

wear wedding rings anyway, so it wasn't like something my wife

reminded me about. And as we were moving,

my wife was opening up her jewelry

box, she goes, look what I found.

So I have it back on and now Bayo's licking it again.

How much was my ring?

I don't remember. Um, it's um,

I got,

I just, I wanted something interesting, so I

got the, the middle's made out of, from a meteorite.

So the middle is, is

made from meteor, is a meteorite. That's why you can see

it's um, oxidizing over here a little bit.

But not everywhere because of the way it is.

And you can see the, the, the, the grains

of the, of the metal, of the rock.

And then the outside is um,

is uh, uh,

hammered, I think, cobalt.

But the cool thing is, is that when you

slice a meteorite, the

the way that the grain is

I can't really see it here. You see how it's

it's not really gonna,

I can't really do this, it's

it's like, the pattern is insane.

On the, on the, on the rock.

Is it not gonna focus at all?

Yeah, look at that.

You see that? How it's like, so many different

lines and shapes and shit.

That's sick. How many zero

DTE AI, AON calls is that worth?

Go to hell. Alright.

AON's still holding up right now. I'm hoping

five and bounce is back. I don't know what's going on with FI

though. I mean, I'm not complaining.

Yo, my JetBlue calls are green!

Bro, I've been red on these for

I've been red on these for like three weeks.

Are you DCing NVO

or sitting on it now? I'm just letting the, the

the, the dividend buy more shares for me.

Are you still in Mir or have you

taken some profit? I only have two of my

leaps left. I think they're up

105%. Damn,

Peloton came back, huh?

Alright, I got some dry powder now.

I wanna take five and calls.

I'm not going to.

Let's go Chewy. Let's go

Chewy. We're up 20%

on those calls. Why are you so

confident in five and? Who said

I was confident? I, it's a

catalyst. I'm just keeping

my shares right now. I'm trying

to buy the dip on something. So this morning,

um, I was looking

through there. They're, they're, they

basically came out and said, hey, we, uh,

we're expecting, um,

$175 million in free cash

flow target for next year, which isn't a

lot of money considering they're, you know,

it's only 1%, but

it, it's because they said

that they're, they're, they're, they're, they're gonna be

focusing more on their AI driven

platform that, that they're, that they've got

building right now, and they're doing $150

million, uh, share repurchase

program. So

you take into account the fact that they're

doing more in R&D, even though

AI is not really as hot right this

moment as it has been, and $150

million of, of potential free cash flow

is gonna be going into a buyback. I, I

like the, I like that as a, as a reason for

some people to buy into the dip on the short term.

Maybe a day trade or something like that. I'm playing shares

right now with a stop loss, but, um,

I'm, I'm keeping a close eye on it, just cause I like

those things. I, I, I like, I like, I like, uh,

a catalyst like that.

Are you still in UUU? Yeah, I still have my shares.

I think I'm only up like 170% now

though. Alright, we got a few movers right now.

Walmart doing pretty good. Chewy Leaps are doing really,

really good. Uh, FI coming back

strong. We ever talk chips in

China? We did this morning about, uh,

the, the new, uh, the new, uh,

uh, curbs on the, the watered down chips

going to China. Still holding

till rate puts? No, we sold those a while ago.

Do you DCA into any stocks currently?

Um, I dollar

cost average on mostly VU and

shit like that. Uh, this morning,

um, the only thing

I bought into this morning,

uh, in my, in my long to midterm,

um, was

I bought some EVGO.

Uh,

and I think I bought a

little bit of TSSI in my, uh,

in my, in my growth spec portfolio.

But that's about it. Nothing, nothing, nothing

wild. I, I really want to see

because like I said, this sh- I wasn't worried about

the government shutdown in the beginning. I said if it gets to

30 days, I'm going to be a little concerned. Um,

and, and we're there. And we're seeing the effects

of it. So, you know, the fact that we're in,

we're in extreme fear right now and people

are, you know, going

a little bit less risk and a little bit, um,

more, uh,

deleveraging a little bit right now.

Waiting on this because the longer we get closer to the

holidays, the more it's going to impact

everyone, especially with the travel and the holiday spending.

So, it's something that I, I, I'm

not like, I'm not selling anything.

Um, but, uh, but I

am, you know, keeping close eye on a few

things that I want because this cash is going to come

back into the market. Right now, it's rotating into

dividends. Not, not heavily, but the,

it's not a full outflow of the market. It is, there

is rotation happening into defensive and dividends.

But, um, when this cash leaves the

market, it's going to have to come back. There's just nowhere else

for the cash to go. There's just nowhere else for the

cash to go. And

it's, it's going to have to come back in. So, the moment

that there is an announcement of a shutdown, um,

deal or, or

a deal being done to avert the shutdown,

uh, or even if it's the Supreme Court

shutting down tariffs for the short term, the money's

going to come flying back in.

The money's going to come flying back in.

And

that's kind of just what I'm buying

my time. The problem is, is how long

do we continue to sell off? How long does this government

shutdown last and how close do we get to the

holidays? That's the problem. So, it's about,

it's about either having the fucking

cojones or over, ovaries to, to,

to, to hold until

then and just dollar

cost average on the way down rather than trying to buy every

single dip. Of course, if it drops more than 1%

intraday, I'll buy an extra share of VU or something like that.

But let your dollar cost average buy for you on the way

down because we don't know how long it's going to do. But the

moment that that does turn, we're going to see an, we're

going to see a fucking violent, um,

uh, buy up. The problem

is, though, is that how close we get

to the holidays, the impact is going to be

so much greater that we might see people say,

you know what? Fuck it. I'll come back after Christmas.

Okay?

But I've been streaming

and doing this

on Twitch through the 2018

crash, COVID,

2022 recession,

okay?

Fucking tariffs.

I, I, I, I've streamed through all

this and this,

I can tell you this right now.

I bought the dips or dollar cost

average through them and

I'm sure glad I did.

So, do the same thing.

The market will always go back up.

Congrats on your FTNT

buys. Wait, I just added my position

yesterday. How's that doing?

I haven't even looked at it. Where are we at? Where's FTNT?

Oh, goddamn, we're up six and a half

percent on shares since yesterday.

You sold off in COVID?

Well, February 24th of 2020, yes.

Uh, half of my portfolio I liquidated.

Yes, abso-fucking-lutely.

I did a whole video, it's still up on YouTube,

about COVID

getting to Europe and what I think it's going to do to U.S.

and what it's going to do to the economy, and I liquidated, yes.

But that's also my personal decision.

I don't recommend that for most

people. There's no way the shutdown will

last till the holidays. I want to agree

with you. I want to agree with you.

I want to agree with you that

there's no way it lasts that long.

But I also thought there's no way

this administration did

this, and that, and

that, and that, and they

did. So, I'm at that point

now where I evolve,

and when I evolve,

I don't stick to my way of thinking.

I evolve with what's happening, and that's why

I think I'm able to

navigate things a lot better than other people.

Because I'm like, okay, I'm not going to get

stuck in my way. You know, you get punched in the face a few

times, you know, you're like, okay, maybe I shouldn't

stand there anymore, you know? Somebody's like, oh, he'll get

tired eventually. No, fuck that. So,

this administration

has shown very clearly that when I

think something can't be done, or they're

not going to do something, they fucking

do it. Alright? Or

they find a way around to do it. So, I'm

no longer in the

wheelhouse of, well, they won't do this.

So, I

agree with you. There's no fucking way they let

this shit go to

Thanksgiving, because too many goddamn Americans

with actual money who are their voter base

are going to be pissed off and not give a shit

if it's Republicans or Democrats. They're going to get primaried hard,

and that's going to be huge fodder for

next year's elections.

Common sense would tell you that.

But we're past common sense right now.

In the market,

in the economy, in

politics. I mean, fuck, there's

two thousand of you watching a guy

in a basement talking about the stock market.

We're beyond fucking reasonable

thought anymore, okay?

We're beyond that.

So, accept that, and then go from there.

Just put the line

in the bag, old man.

That's how we know you're not bought and paid for?

Okay, that's a fair point. That's not

true. I'm bought and paid for by you fucking

daddies and mommies.

Thanks for the spy

call signal. That wasn't a signal,

bro. And we're nowhere

near out of this right now.

This is my first impression of you?

Okay, first of all, your name is 10

midgets, and

you were here two years ago.

You were here in August of

2023. You asked if someone

had a link to the Nvidia

stream.

You dropped an emote that said chat

rub L. Then you came

back two years later, dot dot dot,

this is my first impression of you. No, it's not.

You probably aged so much since then

he couldn't tell. Stocky signals

always hit on a Friday. Listen,

listen, um,

before you leave for two more years, can you do me

a favor? I've never asked anybody

here to ever do anything, but I'm kind of being

pressured to do this, but it's

still kind of cool. Can you,

before you leave, can you go to the stream rewards

and nominate me for League of

Their Own? Because they're going to be forced

to, if

I get nominated, they're going to be forced to interview me

live on the red carpet in front of a few

hundred thousand people, which is

And if

I end up winning the nomination, I am

100% dropping stepsister.

Uh, in my acceptance speech.

So can you do me a favor? Exclamation point award

and just go there and just

and just vote and nominate

me? It takes like two seconds.

Why do you keep

ignoring Stock Jock? He does the

same thing as you.

Oh, I'm sorry, guys. Um, please

don't vote, nominate me, vote somebody

else. What the fuck kind of

question is that? He should, he should

get it, he should nominate himself too. What's wrong

with you, bro? I like Stock Jock.

Okay?

But not enough to fucking

put him here? Fucking

look at, motherfucker looks like

he's like Hanson if they grew, if

they age 50 years and fucking

recovered from like a goddamn heroin addiction.

I love the guy, but nah,

hell nah. How are you a league of your

own if you do do the same thing? You,

first off, we're both in our own

league. Him and I don't do

the exact same thing. I don't know

how you, how you get that. And if

you're, if you're going to play that game of, well, there's somebody

else out there that does something similar to what you do, there's

no such thing as a league of their own. There's nobody

on the internet who does one thing that no one

does anything similar to. But

the way you do it and, and how it is is different.

You're not going to win Burn

Peanut exists

and does unique graphics.

Graphics. Doing

graphics is unique.

Don't they have a visual arts category?

Then again, I, they don't

do it. Last year, the, the league of their

own, uh, literally had

a YouTuber that does

IRL and gaming and with like

23 million subs on YouTube. And I'm like,

that doesn't make it. Oh, I get it

now. Listen, I'm not,

I'm not here to fight this out. It's not that important

to me. This isn't like something like

if I don't get nominated, it's going to

crush my soul. I never get nominated.

All right. It's not about that. It's

just, I have been

asked to

stop being a

shithead and

actually

say something positive about myself for

once or, or, or, or

encourage something like this

before. Okay. And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

it's, it's, it's, I, I made a promise

to somebody. Okay.

All right. Now, fuck them.

Never stop being yourself. It's my

wife, bro. We were talking

about the streamer awards and she goes,

she goes, how come you never

tell anybody to vote for you or nominate you?

I said, because I don't, it's not that important

and stuff like that. She's like, yeah, but why don't you tell it? You,

you, you know, you're, you're, you're somebody that I said,

I don't give a shit. That's not that big on this. Plus

I'm just, I'm just some guy doing stocks in it.

She said, just fucking do

it. You deserve it. I'm like, I

don't fucking deserve it. She's like, fine, but at least

just, at least try. Do something

different. Stop being scared.

Okay. I think she really just

wants me to promote her app

uh, uh, when I, if I get there.

Well, you should fuck your wife.

You don't think I'm trying? Although I'm getting in a

um, you really are in a

league of your own. You do-

You really are in a league of your

own. You do stocks and a podcast.

Keep going, Ethan. What?

I don't do a- I haven't done a podcast

in years. Report

Wall Street Journal's Democrats are set to

block the new GOP proposal to end the shutdown.

I think we're getting close though

because she likes the black leather couch

and she just found out

for some reason that there's

a giant mirror right there.

So now she's like, oh. I'm like,

yeah. Telling you guys,

your girl's a freak.

Y'all just gotta make her comfortable.

Let her be herself.

Alright.

Let's start legging out of some shit here.

Hello, Hillary Clinton's emails. How you doing?

I'm gonna take Figma over the weekend.

That's gonna be my- that's gonna be my weekend, Yolo.

I got- I got bailed out

yesterday and was able to get the earnings play

back to green, but I'm going to

uh, I'm gonna take that over the weekend.

And the reason I'm gonna do that is, is

that I know Kathy just

bought a bunch of shares and there's a report,

it hasn't been confirmed yet, but that

Google is taking a stake in Figma.

I got a feeling Stocky and his wife

are the most vanilla fucks in bed.

Alright, bro. You got it.

You got it. You got it. Out of respect

for my wife, I'm just gonna not go there.

If you only knew the amount

of stuff she's put up his ass. She-

Nevermind. Alright.

You guys missed the shower in the background?

Excuse me, I need to go

pray and bathe myself

in holy water. From what?

You're Canadian. You're literally

the definition of vanilla in bed.

No, I hated the shower.

You need a microphone for your wife? We don't need any more.

The corruption of this stream?

Once you confuse shower sounds with bacon, there's no going back-

Okay, let's- guys, we're getting- we're getting- we're getting

way off topic right now.

Way off topic. We need to get back to the market.

Okay?

I missed the team's messages? Why? They're gonna

they're gonna go off on your- on your computer

in five minutes. How stupid would I be

to sell Chewy to go back into AEHR?

That'd be stupid, right?

I bought some D-Pro this morning.

KTOS is

attractive, again, after their earnings.

Did you see the Sidney Sweeney interview about the

jeans? No. Was it- was there something

worthwhile there? Alright, let's

start going over some news. I got some shit that I gotta go over with.

It's Friday, and I have to get content

from my editors, so we got a lot of shit

to do today. Although,

Will fuckin'

decided to get a little spicy

on Instagram,

and

the- the thumbnail for my latest

video- by the way, I

opened up a Cameo account, and then they

said I couldn't be verified my, uh,

my, uh, my, um,

my identity. Look at

this. It says,

socialism takes New York City.

I never said that, so

I guess he added that as a- as a-

as a- as a, um,

the thumbnail? I guess you can

make thumbnails now, and he just realized that?

That's some AI shit. And the

crazy thing is, is

that people are like,

did he really write New York City

elect socialist ma- oh my

god. But the funny thing is, is that

people were actually really happy with the video. They're

like, this is a very real glass- half

full take. Okay?

I love hearing the sound of rational from a

person genuinely curious, prefers knowledge over money.

Like, but then it-

it went and just devolved into

some fuckin' horrible shit.

But, dude fuckin', like,

a little excited about his victory. Why?

Cause I wanna see how it plays out.

Anybody who's a Republican should be happy

about it, and anybody who's a social

Democrat should be happy about it. And I'll tell you why.

If you're a Republican, and you have always

stated- whoops.

My 2024 taxes with me as a stripper

in Miami, Florida. Oh, she was supposed to come

on the stream and I forgot. Hi, is this Jeremy?

But this shit's at like 300,000

views today. But he's

literally a socialist, literally described that too, it's not

clickbait. No, I understand, but the way you

put that out there, it makes it seem like clickbait.

Your Instagram is poppin' now, I send your

clips to friends and family, they love them. Yeah,

I really feel stupid for not, um,

again, I always feel stupid for not, um,

uh, starting

my- starting posting on Instagram two years ago.

I'd be well over half a million by now.

I mean, we've only been doing it since April, and we're already at

107,000 people and like

hundreds of millions of, uh,

views now. Alright,

AAON's still doing good.

Um, alright.

I don't think I really need to open any more positions today.

What's up, Hugh Janus?

I haven't read their

earnings, how bad were they?

Did you, did you, did you, did you listen to them

or read them, or what, what's happening?

You forgot those Walmart calls? Yeah.

Um, let's see. Some of them I have.

Uh, I have three

left, we're up about 17% on them.

Did you ever get the YouTube plaque for crossing

100,000? Oh, no, no, no, you just reminded me, I gotta

order that. Man, I was thinking about that the other day,

I'm not about to get depressing on a Friday, but I was thinking about the other day,

I was like, I was like,

I got the, the, the Twitch thing,

and now a YouTube

play button, and I still have this

show, and I was like, I had,

I got nobody to share it with, like,

to show, like, I have my wife and my kids,

but like, all my family's

gone, and like, none of them got to

see me have success.

You know what I mean? Like,

I was just a failure my

whole life. The word

potential is a word that I

fucking hate, because everyone said you're such a

wasted potential. And I

was just a failure my whole life, and

I was a drug addict and

an alcoholic into my 30s, and like,

now I got all this, and like,

no one got to see me get there.

You know? They all

passed away, and I was just a, a

failure, you know what I mean? It doesn't

weigh on me heavy, because like,

I started a new

cycle in my family tree,

and I don't need anybody

to be proud of me, and I'm very happy that I'm

able to provide for my family and do all this, but like,

it's just wild, you know what I mean?

It's just, it's just wild.

You know? Like,

I never had anybody proud of me.

I was just always

what could have been,

or wasted potential, or

a failure, you know what I mean?

And,

you know, it's crazy.

It's kind of crazy. I don't

need the affirmation so it doesn't weigh

heavy on me, and my kids have only

ever known this. My wife

is the only person in my life that's seen me go

from bottom to top.

And now I like to switch her from bottom

to top sometimes, but,

but yeah, that was just kind of wild. So yeah,

so thank you for reminding me. I gotta get my play button.

I don't really keep them anywhere.

I don't really keep them anywhere.

Um, but uh,

my wife told

me to put it in the background behind me,

so I did, but I did it where you

can't see it. So right now

we've got the, ask me

anything about money homeless sign.

Praise be Saint Jerome Powell.

The horse clock.

There's the, there's the Twitch thing.

And I had a choice

between,

down over here on the ground,

I had a choice between

our wedding picture

and Peyton Manning.

Put this back in the drawer. Bro, you're about

five minutes late on that one.

I love the women in here all pissed off at me.

I love the, you prick,

what the fuck is wrong with you? How could you?

You dare? That's right.

Homeless?

Sign, Jerome Powell,

horse clock, Peyton

Manning, and a giant butt plug.

My wedding picture,

my, our wedding picture did not make it yet.

That's right, you're, you're, you're willingly watching

this stream right now.

Butt plug over wedding pic is crazy?

Not anymore, it ain't. Willingly

is a strong word. Are you in Delaware

now? Yeah. Stocky, I know more about

your personal life than my childhood best friends.

Okay.

Are you gonna put a green screen behind you?

US Army plans to buy, oh I'm still on full screen.

US Army plans to, uh,

buy at least one million drones over the next

two to three years. Yeah, drone, that's why we

talked about KTOS the other day.

It fell, but they're still big on, uh, on

drones, and the US government is really going

all in on drones right now.

I want to, um, I want to

put the green screen up, and I was going to, but then somebody said

to be careful. Weren't your family proud

of you when you were in the military? Family's usually proud of that.

Mmm. Listen,

I don't wanna talk about that shit. Like, I wasn't trying to get all sentimental.

I was just, somebody reminded me about something.

Alright. Alright, let's keep going.

What the fuck was that?

You holding WeRide? Dumping like a penny

stock? Oh no, a stock is

falling a lot? Let me tell

you about stocks that I own that, that, that

fell 80%. That

four years later were up a thousand percent.

Alright, first off, WeRide is very speculative.

Second of all, I'm buying about

10 to 20 shares every 50 cents down.

And third of all, I ain't scared.

I've been doing this too long, bro. I've been doing

this too long. That shit don't scare me. That shit

don't scare me. Okay?

Alright? I took WeRide

leaps the other day when I took Veo to the pet,

the vet, and I'm like, this is for you, buddy.

And now he can't, now he can't afford his, uh, appointment

next week. And that's sorry to him, but that's okay.

I'll make it up with something else. But

no, joking, jokes aside. Listen,

I'm playing a very speculative play. I'm not

putting a giant portion of my portfolio into it

because it's very speculative. I have nothing,

nothing in the world that, to prove

that, that Nvidia is gonna bring, uh,

WeRide into the circle jerk about with

OpenAI and, and, and autonomous vehicles

and, and the money laundering, I mean, sorry, the money

transferring thing that they're doing right now.

But, there's a chance.

And I'm willing to take that chance.

Because autonomous vehicles are big.

Um, WeRide, uh, just went on

the Hong Kong Exchange, didn't do too well, and they are

getting a shitload of permits everywhere. And so I

am not scared. We talked about it yesterday

morning that, um, autonomous

vehicles and robo-taxi, um,

rides and shares are

exploding and people are now preferring those

over traditional. That's why

Uber and Google are making investments, uh,

or Nvidia and, and Uber are making

investments and stuff like that because people

don't want to deal with other human

beings. COVID changed the game.

Okay?

We have gone from longing and yearning

for human interaction to

we need it, but we want it in a way that we can

shut it off whenever we want. And that's why live streaming

is exploding. That's why they, so people

don't want to get into, they will

pay more to not have to deal with

a person. Here.

You're just trying to be cute for a treat, huh?

Huh? Is that all you want? Is that all you want?

Yeah? Okay. You want? You get

all you want? You get all you want? You just

want some lovin'? You just want some lovin'? You just want some lovin'?

Oh, you just want some lovin'?

Welcome Beldori and Theok to the

Bear Gang. Go get your ball.

Get your ball. There's your ball right there. Get your ball.

Get your ball. Right there. You don't like it?

Okay. Google did buy Fig shares.

Yeah, I think Fig might be a, uh, a YOLO

over the weekend. Pretty good earnings. Cathie Wood and Ark

bought some and, and Google bought some too.

Wow, I've never seen his face so beautiful.

He's an old man now.

My wife's birthday was, uh, was last weekend.

Um, and Saturday

and this was a week after we got

the, the news that he has lymphoma

and that's her baby so she was devastated

and then we,

you know, we ended up

you know, seeing the doctor or whatever like that but

we got some good news and so

what I did was is I said, alright, here's what we're gonna do.

We're gonna, for your birthday, we're gonna go to his favorite

park that we used to take him to before the kids

and we're gonna go have a picnic out there and run the shit

out of him in the fields and stuff like that

and then we'll have your birthday cake and I went to the cake

place and I said, hey, I need you to do me a favor.

I said, this is her favorite cake

but can you take this picture of her and him

and put it on the cake, on the top of the cake

and then

um, on the sides

can you get the little like

like, can you wrap it with this

picture like that I have like a panoramic

or whatever and it just was like

different moments

with him, the day she got us

she got him as a puppy and then the first

time that we took him out and then

him with our first baby and then with the

second and kind of like a pan- and they

did it and like

it was like, it was the best birthday cake

I ever got for somebody so it was a good

one, it was a good one

she really liked it

I feel like you've been in a great mood

and glowing since the move, call it a hot

take but I like the new stonky, you got healthy

yellows, nah but I got a healthy

fucking sex drive, tell your

mom it's been a while since I fucking drained

one on her face, I'm sorry, let me just, you know what

I'm, I'm, don't

let's just do marbles and then let's get into the news

I got some crazy news we need to go over

okay, let's go

alright, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in

point play, go, go, go, go, go, El Capi

congratulations

thanks for the signal on spy calls, I made 50%

on my puts, that's funny

cause the calls would have made like 100%

that's toxic, Stonky, I know, I don't know what to

do with nice things, compliment

equals I fucked your mom, I mean, I don't know what else to

do, like, what do you want me to do

you want me to just sit here and be like, thank you guys

and every time somebody says something nice, like, be like

aw, thank you, aw, appreciate it

hey, you know, that's really nice, or hey man

you know, it's not me, it's you, aw, you're great

aw, thanks man, thanks for

saying that nice thing about me, thanks for that

no, man, you don't come here

for that, you come here for, like

something different

not, not yelling and

belittling you, you're used to that, it's just

that I don't hate you, your parents and your friends

do, okay, come on, come on

come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, we wanna do this and I gotta

get a lot of news to go over and we gotta talk about

um, some of the shit from the senate as well

what the fuck is this

great, oh no

no, no, no, I don't want the ad version

daddy arrow has AI marketing

okay, that didn't mean anything

what is this, why am I getting an ad

what is this

I said we're going to jail, look at Kodak

we're up 80% on our

leaps, Sarah with

the W, and of course all the ladies

in here going, Sarah, oh my, what do you want

Sarah, is Sarah the one with eight

kids, I think she has six

not sure, I'll think on it and get back to you, okay

once you're beyond three you have

eight, yeah, uh oh

US transportation secretary is uh, is

speaking right now

what's going on with Kodak, pension

revision transaction, okay, what's going on with Kodak

they had good earnings, oh

maybe their little loot boxes worked, that's the whole reason

we got into it, we got into it because

we thought the loot boxes would give them unexpected revenue

I can't believe that actually worked out

maybe that's not the reason that it did

but who cares, I mean, fuck it

it's always the one that we have the weird, like

you know, theories on that work

out, like remember GoPro

in the senate and see who voted to open the

government and who voted to shut it down

and then I'd call those senators who voted

to shut it down, I don't think anybody voted to shut it down

I think they did vote on a bill that would be

the reason for shutting down, I hate politics

I understand there's true differences of opinion

and I'm okay with that, now we talked about

the flight cancellations today

okay, yesterday we talked about how

10% of flights are gonna be

cancelled, um

United Airlines is cancelling

uh, several hundred flights

Harry Reid airport in Las Vegas

did a ground halt

you know, set the number of people we have in each party

if you lost an election

you can't just stomp your feet and

pound, you know, pound your fist and say

I wanna get my way by... there goes Stocky again

giving another girl VIP

and when I see a woman in chat that's been here a while

I put her VIP, I hate it, be a hater

maybe leverage a vote, get angry

maybe leverage a debate

but to give something up to open

the government up I think would be a mistake

on the Republicans part

now also we have the holidays

which side folds first I think Republicans do

Republicans have more to lose right now

is your hope that this is... Republicans

have way more to lose right now

and the reason is, is that um

that the midterms

are coming up and historically

first midterm of a

of an administration that has control of both

chambers of Congress and the

presidency loses

either the House or the Senate

and after what we just saw with the elections

that happened this past week

we see that there's a lot of

base for the Democrats right now that are getting out

whether it's more of them getting out to vote or less

Republicans in the MAGA site getting out to vote

either way we saw more of a shift to the left

after an election where we saw a massive shift to the right

and so Republicans are

most at danger of not only

losing control of one of those but

maybe both and if you have

the Trump in the White House

and both chambers being controlled by the opposite

party it's fucking game over

for them so they have

the most to lose from it they don't want to back

down because obviously taking

the parties away right now

doing a continuing resolution

from the last administration

and the controlling house and then the people voted

those people out

right and voted new people in and then

forcing the old bill

the old budget to be the new budget

it makes sense why you wouldn't want to

do that right from a political

standpoint if you take away Republicans Democrats

or you flip it right let's say this was Democrats

winning and Biden was in office and

the people voted out Republicans

they voted in Democrats and the Republicans were like

we want you to pass

the same bill we had under Trump

you'd be like no fuck that right

so from the party side but Republicans are doing

it in a way that is like

extreme so

this is one of those things where it's

like no one's going to cave

but the thing is that Republicans are going to have

to at least

meet the Democrats for a new

bill because the Republicans have the

most to lose

they have the most to lose because

they are close they are so close

they control the House and the Senate

why can't they pass it without Democrats

because the thing that people

hate when their party is not in control

or is in control

is the thing they love when their party is not in control

our government was designed

that you couldn't have

it's difficult

people hate it but the fact that

it takes so god damn much

work to get something passed in legislation in our

country is one of the most beautiful fucking things

in the world it's one of the most beautiful

fucking things in the world because

it stops the

minority from being oppressed by the majority

theoretically

and the reason that it's so important is

that when people are in the minority

of representation

they're so happy

that they can't be oppressed

or have things just jammed down their throat

and forced into things because that's a constitutional

republic right it's like

the idea in our

government the idea of a democracy

and Thomas Jefferson said it a democracy is one of the

most dangerous forms of government in the world

it really is a pure true democracy

is one of the most dangerous forms of government there is

because that means the majority can

do whatever they want to the minority right

51% of people can force 49% of people

into whatever they want that's a pure democracy

right the idea of a constitutional republic

is you

give the majority

the choice of it but you give the minority

a seat at the table it can't

be forced on them right

there has to be an overwhelming

majority okay

to bypass that so that you give

people the right if people hate the electoral college

and they hate the idea that states get equal representation

of two votes depending on despite

their population but that's kind of how it was designed

right because we are people forget this we are the

United States of America we were designed that

every state is like its own country and we just kind of share

a border and a government of course it's gone past

that since then and so the idea is that every

state when we formed this country

there was an agreement that every

state would get equal representation when it

comes to passing legislation House of Representatives

has the population

is

represented based on population they write the laws

and the Senate has to each state gets a seat

at the table and says okay we agree we don't agree

of course people don't like it for several reasons

but this is just the way it was set up

right now Republicans

are pissed off that

they can't just force through this bill

we have the majority why can't we just do this right

when they were in the

minority last cycle

they were all saying oh

thank God that we don't have this in place

because then the Democrats could just force us to do

whatever you see what I mean

and vice versa

and so you know

the filibuster people don't like the filibuster

when it works against them but they love

it when it saves them and

that is how partisan and how divided

we've gotten on politics that we can't even

understand

about the shoe fitting

or shoe on the other foot kind of thing

people want to believe that everything is cool

as long as they have the power when their

guys in power but guess what you're not going to be in power

and when you give that up and you give that total

power and you're no longer in control

you're fucked

it's why this whole Jimmy Kimmel thing that

happened I'm not a fan of Jimmy Kimmel

but the idea

that people were happy that the

government got involved

and forced him to be

kicked off the air because

he said things people didn't like I'm like

imagine if that was somebody

in the conservative

mindset said something that was offensive

to people that were

on the left and

the Biden administration had done that

people would be calling for war

but yet they're happy when it happens there

and I'm like you gotta make sure that yes

you may not like something or disagree with something

but you need to make damn sure that you don't fuck

yourself either you know what I mean

it's like when people it's like being

in a relationship it's like if you go out you step out on

your spouse and you're like oh it's

but if your spouse did it to you you'd be devastated it's like

what the fuck you know what I mean like dude think about it both ways

so are you in power

if you're an ICE agent what the

fuck are you talking about me and an ICE agent

what the fuck are you talking

about what the fuck how do you

what did you just do so if

you in power

if you were an ICE agent getting a DUI

90 minutes after you get off your shift in a torture facility

I don't want the majority who

support people like that what the fuck

is going on bro I was talking

in generalizations

what does it mean if you for stocks

if you are your own dad what the

what does that have are you guys

why are all my gains for the year

gone I don't know how that's fucking possible

what's up you wanna go upstairs

huh you wanna go see mommy

okay come let's go see mommy

mommy's boy hold on

I know I have the

reasonable takes on the internet not a good thing

this is bipartisan everybody

agrees that this has to be done

and when you have

bipartisanship and recognition of the

problem that actually is the

is the best

political situation

you can have to get the rest of the money so I'm

hopeful they'll give me the rest of it

and by the way so this is the common automation platform

there's but

some of our towers and centers are

just they're really really old

and so

not all of them but

many of them have to be rebuilt

and so some of the money in the plan is also

for actually bricks and mortar

to build you know

new infrastructure

these

our controllers should not be working in some of the environments

that they're working in on some of the equipment

that they're using and just one last point

on that we do have old equipment

the equipment works the equipment is safe

but it is old we have

he looks really really old

fuck you bro I'm not that it's not that bad

it's just a new camera

is why we

have a safe efficient system

and again I think it's

it's atrocious that they would be

we have to go tour my daughter's

potential new school today

and it's a catholic school

it's only because we need somewhere

for a few months until the summer

and one semester and then we

decide where we're going to go with both kids

and

my wife has said to me

please

I said what she goes just please

I go what

she goes please

no she's not going to stay there for a long time

we just needed a school for

for now and the spring

for pre-k and then

next year we're going to spend

time if we decide to move here

we're going to decide we're going to put her

the problem is that the only other school that's a private school

that um

is nearby wants 2500

for the year and you have to pay for the

whole year even if you only come for half a year

and on top of that it's kind of far

away so

this has got a good reputation here I'm going

because I want to make sure I'm going to look around

I grew up in a Baptist children's home I grew up in a Christian

children's home you can't hide shit

from me you can doctor shit

up but I can look in the eyes of kids and tell

you right now what happens there

no matter how much they smile

the way they stand the way they react to

to anything the way

I know I know so I'll check and

make sure that it's a good school because just because it's Catholic

doesn't mean it's bad let my daughter

you know get into it you know

you know have a little bit of of that and

then then we'll get in the summer we'll be able to find a place

that a good school for her because we also have to decide

where we are um

where we are if we're

moving up here and buying a house and and all that

stuff so by then we'll know and we'll have a place to know

I want to go to Hocasin but

so that but yeah I have to go at 2pm today

to a Catholic

preschool or

it's not a preschool it's a Catholic elementary

school or whatever it is

I promised my wife

I would behave what do you have against

Catholics Catholics

are afraid of Catholic school the fuck you talking about

little bro you think it has anything to do with Catholics

bro die hard Catholics

who went to Catholic school are like yeah that shit was

fucking crazy my Catholic school

had all the rich kids with the best drugs

no you have no reason to fear a Catholic

school unless you're

Native American and you're in

Canada I need a

crazy whiteboard you should

bury that joke

y'all on one today

I can recognize it my question not

tame enough for a whiteboard what was your question let me see

I haven't looked at my um Twitch really

needs one of those alert things where whenever

you have a channel

point thing it just alerts

you this is what my email

looks like uh GG

Larry how you been dude

you sent me a DM did I

reply to you if you guys remember

Larry was the um

the guy who helped out a long time ago

we were able to pay his rent

he's going through a tough time

are you still adding to your NVX and we ride

uh NVX no

if it goes under a dollar I'm gonna

fucking go nuts on it we ride yes I'm buying

every like 50 cents down

father of two toddlers we already answered that

did you start dressing more posh since the Delaware move

I answered that yesterday

come back to us bro silly girl

you look like a prune at the bottom of a barrel

in the summer desert

Klarna thoughts

I don't really like buy now pay later um

right now just because there's so much

more competition publicly like in

the beginning it was I think Klarna

has has has

a chance to be a

leader in that sector but everybody and their brother

is offering and now PayPal is doing it too

for buy now pay later also they're starting to

add credit uh to check or to the

credit score from that and with the

amount of people that are going defaulting

delinquent on uh on on credit card

now it's gonna pile up on there and

they're gonna take massive losses now that's

okay in some cases because you don't mind

taking losses if you're taking market share

but they're losing some market share because more

more companies are offering it so I'm a little

bit skeptical of Klarna right now

just simply because I don't mind a company

losing a lot of money if it's for customer

acquisition and and and owning the market

space but they're actually losing market space

so if they're losing

money and market space at the same

time you know it's kinda

like oof you know

um so I'm a little skeptical

of them as as as

that you know in that

regards now that could change I mean I could see the earnings

report of the next quarter or two and they could be

adding more or cutting down on debt or

seeing uh more uh or less

delinquencies but as of right now based on the delinquencies

based on um the

credit reporting uh you know

there's gonna be a lot of customers that come to them right now

but uh but as

far as a sustainability model uh

I'd like to see them have either more market

share or just an a huge

increase in basis and they could they could I mean people

are are using I mean Airbnb

just announced that they were doing um

uh offering uh buy now pay later

uh pretty soon in the future so you just never know

I'm sorry uh ooga booga

uh I know buy

how can we pay off credit card debt

fast not pay for six months and

pay 35% of the original owed

well if you wanna

pay off credit card um

the best thing you can do is is is

consolidate it if you if you

if you haven't fixed your spending problem

it doesn't matter but the best thing you can do is get a personal

or consolidation loan credit company

credit unions do the best for that because

if you can get the uh a personal loan

um for the total amount of your

credit card debt and even if they charge

you 14% that's

much better than the 30% APR that you're

you're paying so now you

can pay them all off at once rather than

you know having to hop between them and

and then whatever and now you're paying half the

percentage on a single transaction

on a single a single uh loan

that's the best way to do it if you

can't get the full amount get the amount for

the one with the highest uh interest first and

pay that one off then work on the

rest of them you're starting to remind me of bob

haskins who the fuck is bob haskins

oh i know bob haskins

he was shmee from uh

hook you know any good resources

to educate yourself on how to invest and save money

there's lots of resources it's

just dependent on how you consume

the resources some people can just read if

you go into discord at the top of our discord there's a channel

that says stock market for beginners or basics

whatever two github links that send you to all the shit

investopedia is a great place

um the information

is out there it's just about getting it and

putting it in front of you and how do

how do you best uh absorb it

some people do it here because they

they they enjoy the fucking you know

the way i talk and the the fucking stupid

memes and jokes stuff like that it keeps it like

fresh and change up and they learn in between it

osmosis kind of shit some people prefer to just

read investopedia is a great tool

youtube has a great uh opportunity uh thing

uh we have little communities in our in our discord

for investing or personal

finance or uh 401ks and

iras or real estate or careers where people

just have discussions and ask each other questions

about their experience and what they've learned and stuff like that

like we have it here and we just

do it differently but it's everywhere it's just about getting

there i have a hard time sifting

through the garbage when it comes to financial information similar

to trying to find a good workout diet

it just comes with time and experience

one thing about this stream is that i'll be

talking about something or mention something or

give you a some

some kind of information and then you can be like

that's something i want to know more about and now you can know what

to look for rather than just kind of sifting through it

like i i repeat a lot of stuff but i also

don't get into too complicated

because it's everybody's situation is

different but you know it's just it's just about

finding people and being

around people who talk about it

and that's you know they here's

the thing you are the five people

you spend the most time with and if you're not

happy with who you are then change who you spend your time

with if you want to be more successful

in the business world find people who are more

business uh you know oriented if

you want to be better with personal finance stop

hanging out with people who spend all their money spend hang out with

people that that are better with their money you will

eventually become the totality

of the five people you spend the most time with same thing

with where you where you you you you know

get your information or your stuff

you know like go on to

twitter or reddit or whatever and and

and follow subreddits that are

like personal finance and etfs

and investing and stocks stuff like that there's not

there's some in there but there's a lot of stuff and eventually

you'll just start picking it up that's interesting that's

interesting that's interesting and you just start to kind of get

a baseline and when you have a baseline then everything kind

of is clicks more for you

i spend the most time with you

reddit is a cesspool i understand that

stop killing spy i'm

not doing you're joking

but there's people out there who get mad at me

when the market falls like legitimately

get pissed off at me

when the market falls fuck

you stock guy what the market's

down my my investments my portfolio

is down three percent this month fuck you i hate you

what the fuck what the fuck does that have to do with

me well you told me that i should

invest my money you should

yeah but i'm i don't have as much as i did last

month okay that's just part of the market

motherfucker buy more

nah man because if i buy more and it keeps going down

then it's gonna lose then two months

later why didn't i fucking buy more

you showed a bear

on stream last and then moved you sure tanked

the market motherfucker i i

invested in kodak

okay i'm not exactly the fucking pinnacle of

what you should be following okay

can you draw a line joby to twenty dollars by december

first thanks no

uh thoughts on nvo sorry if you've already

talked about it earlier from

a from a from a fundamental standpoint

from a balance sheet standpoint it is

insanely undervalued but this market doesn't

value or look at things that that we consider

value the way it was ten fifteen years ago

everyone is looking at what is the next big

gainer what's the next you know jump

nvo is hurting

right now because um

there's a lot of there's a lot of uh

otc and and and

compound glp ones out there

uh pfizer is now coming in trying to buy out

the company that they were buying forcing

them to either lose out on buying a

pharmaceutical company to help them uh with with

uh production distribution or pay significant

more for it uh and they're

having to cut their their their their

prices lower in return they get to be put

on medicare or whatnot which is going to cause prices

to go way higher um but uh

but i i'm still in it i still

have it my average is like 47 so i'm actually

down on it but i'm letting the dividend reinvestment

happen because i do feel like it's heavily

undervalued the question is is are

is it doesn't matter anymore i

don't know from a balance sheet standpoint it

is one of the most attractive buys

of of a value or a defensive or

pharmaceutical stock that i've ever seen

but that's based on how the market used to

to to to to care about things in the

past markets change do you

still hold stocks you were talking about like on rbrk

and sale um i have my

on semiconductor shares from

1350 that i bought back in

2020 in 2020

um rbrk i

don't have any more sale i still

have but i opened up a new

position in ftnt yesterday

um and for cyber

security did you talk about tesla proving

one trillion dollar package yes um

i talked about it in the morning call this morning there's also

the article up it's not one trillion dollars

directly a lot of it has to come with

insane um

uh uh like uh

milestones including a four and a half trillion dollar

market cap a million robots rolled out by

2030 or whatever it is so it's

not that's to get up to one trillion

it's not gonna get to one trillion unless they do some

crazy shit which they could i guess um

but uh but uh

yeah it uh it changes

a little bit when you look at it like i i obviously don't

want to see somebody get that much and they overwhelmingly

support it with 75 of the votes because nobody wants to

see if he makes good as threatened leaves

the company which he wasn't but just the idea that

he could people don't want to lose their money so

they'll vote for their soul um

but uh but it's not it's not

people misunderstand the headline they think

it's just one trillion dollars it's basically

at 33 or 39

of the company with all the shares and at

a 4.5 trillion dollar valuation

that plus all the incentives

would put it at a trillion dollars

on at 11 is crazy no

my my entry on on semiconductor was

$13.55 that was after

covid we all bought it everybody this

discord that was here bought it same time

we bought aehr for 350.

what sector do you see the most

opportunities in next few years uh cyber security

cyber security is the most undervalued sector in the entire stock market

um

honeywell bad stock or bad company ge

split had positive outcome worried about honeywell post split

ge had more

things that they could split

into like they could legitimately

split into a aerospace

and split into healthcare

and split into you know um

fucking uh

you know whatever

they had more things to split into honeywell

feels more like they're doing it for

uh financial

purposes where they could basically spin off

the part of their business that is not

doing well and that's

that's like losing money and what not kinda like

what um who was it um

johnson johnson did with

kvu basically say hey listen you know that part

of our business that produces all the shit

that we keep killing people with and getting sued for

let's just make it its own little business

and then we could use that as a

write off and not lose money on the

main business and shareholders will be happy

feels like honeywell is doing something serious

cyber security don't tell me palantar

palantir is undervalued

lol

are people stupid or are they trolling me

palantir is not undervalued i never

said palantir was undervalued but

one stock is not a sector

palantir is more than cyber security

they're fucking data collection they're fucking ai

integration they're fucking black ops

military defense shit they're more than just

that but just because one stock is

is overvalued doesn't mean

the whole sector is undervalued

that's so dumb that's so dumb

why is you so dumb

palantir is skynet

palantir is not the only company

but the next world war

is going to be a cyber war

ok we've moved from people

to machines

boats and tanks you know whatever

to air

to drones to

space and then it's going to be cyber

we're not going to be fucking wiping each other out with missiles

anymore why do that when you're going to be able to just fucking

take down the financial world

you know what i mean self preservation is

always going to be key that's why we haven't had nuclear

wars yet nobody wants to

fucking wipe themselves out

so self preservation and mutual

you know mutual preservation is

always going to be there but cyber security

dude that's where it's at you know how much money is getting stolen

from people right now it's wild

it's insane

it's like why did we stop

like invading other countries to

to take their land

right we found out that peace

was more profitable than war

because think about this

ok think about this for a second god what is this shit

in the way god

where's my markers at oh don't break the mic

don't break the mic don't break the mic

you only got one and you don't have a stand

i think it's over here alright so

back in the day

you used to go and

your country and your castle

and your you know

and you used to send your army

right out and you used to go fight this army

and you would win

and you would get the land

well that was great because

you used to make money that way once you have the land

now you get to tax everybody

and you get to make money off of them and you get all their crops

and you get all their food and you get everything

like that so you make money by occupying

that land right

it cost though a lot of money

if you lost that battle

it bankrupted you if you won the battle

it bankrupted you but you had to hope over time

to make your money back from this

it was very expensive

it was very expensive

i did a whole whiteboard on Richard the Lionheart

and how he gets a lot of credit even though he bankrupted his country

so many times

but then we realized something

we can make way more money

lose less money

by just trading with them

we don't have to spend all that money for wars

we don't have to upkeep that land

spend money on upkeeping

patrolling the land

and keeping the peace

look up the peasant revolt

a few hundred years ago

we don't have to worry about all that

we can just make money doing this

peace was more profitable

than war

and when we realized that

we kind of stopped going to war

we started doing these economic interactions

same kind of thing with the next war that happens

world war 3 is going to be a cyber war

because let me tell you something

the amount of money

the amount of time

and the amount of shit that you have to go through

to fight these wars

and then worry about other people joining in

and stuff like that

than sanctions

you're losing money from trade and economics

while spending all this money

and if you do win you don't get anything

except bragging rights

you don't get anything

what are you going to do

go occupy the nation and do what with it

and nowadays with guerrilla warfare

look what happened with Iraq and Afghanistan

spent all that money

what did we gain nothing

this big country is funding this side

and let them fight it out

and that's who wins right

we don't care it's not in our backyard

it's like watching a game of fucking

of risk or some shit

but cyber war that's where it's at

that's where it's at

if you could get in and shut down

a nation's financial system

their financial infrastructure

you own that nation

you own the nation

you collapse the nation

you take down their financial system it's game over

they need to take down their power grid right now

that's the next one

if you don't think that there are tens of thousands

of people or computers

or algorithms or systems right now

attempting to get into the US

financial system right now

you're insane

24-7 tens of thousands

programs people

systems AI algorithms computers

trying to crack codes and get into that system

and they do it every now and then

look at how many hacks we've had recently

look at Microsoft look at

insane look at crypto I mean shit

we had 1.5 trillion or

sorry what was it

60 billion dollars in crypto

already fucking scammed from people

the hacking is insane

this is a fight of

making a system or making

a software or making a program that can crack it

versus trying to stop it who wins

and as long as this

keeps getting money and time and effort

put into it this can never stop

so as wait till quantum

computing gets here you got

yourself a whole can of worms

okay

so yes

you may disagree with me and that's fine

I can't tell you you're wrong

because I'm guessing too

but I put my money in on this and I still

believe that I I I nothing has changed

my mind that cyber security is

undervalued right now

because you're talking about the entire fucking global

financial and systems

which runs this fucking world being

being fucking hinged on

one fucking

guy who whose girlfriend

fucking you know

he caught her fucking you know

the pizza delivery guy who also she went to

high school with who said he's just a friend

and you have nothing to worry about even though

the dude's like 6'1 in good shape

and shit like that but just can't get a real job because

he flunked out of college because he was too busy fucking

partying and having a good time but he's got that

way and she wanted a little something that was like

a little something bad and a little she wanted to go through that

ho phase but she didn't really get that because she was with you

and you're a sweet guy and a nice guy and you make good money working

in tech and cyber security but it's not

it just you work so much and you just didn't

give her that flare and that

you know that something crazy and different

adrenaline rush and it got mundane

and vanilla and she's like you know what and then all of a sudden

she ordered a pizza one day and it was this guy

from high school and she's like I know you oh yeah I remember this

and then she started hanging out with him oh he's just

a friend and you know what and the next thing you know

it's like it's like you just you wondering why

the chair was broken in the living room and she says it's because

she was standing up to get something and then the washer and dryer

are messed up and the next thing you know

you caught him and now you're

at home and you're drinking some fucking

you know 300 year old

you know fucking scotch that somebody

gave you for a promotion one time

that you were never going to open but now you've drank half the

fucking bottle you're sitting in front of your computer

you got fucking dust

from chips everywhere you got fucking

crust from pizza rolls you got a

taquito

fucking thing with salsa

that's just growing mold in it and you're sitting

there staring at your computer every fucking day

and you're like what happened why does my life

suck why is this going on

why me what's wrong with me

fuck women fuck those bitches whatever

you download some fucking Andrew Tate shit

next thing you know you're like yeah

bitches ain't shit I'm a real king I'm this whole thing

so then you go out one day and you're like I'm gonna

show them and you tell these women you ain't shit

right you ain't shit and then you still get rejected

now you're like it's not me it's them

so now you get bitter so now you're like

fuck those women I don't need shit I'm gonna go home

and you know what you're like

no one sees me

no one sees me I'm gonna be the bad boy

I'm gonna be seen and what do you do

you fucking write up some code you write up that code

and you take down the fucking financial system

I'm investing in the people trying

to stop you is stocky the bad

boy of stocks no my ho days are

over long gone all I got

from that is to long papa johns

so you're saying it's women's fault that

we're all gonna die what no

what was I talking about

again bro it's women's fault

we ain't in heaven no more

no it's our fault for being so fucking

easily manipulated by a nice set of tits

okay she didn't force

Adam to do that shit

okay she was eating it

and Adam she's like you should try this and Adam's like

nah and then she goes

you sure he goes

you know what fuck it those yeah

give that shit to me whatever you want it's our fault

we're weak all right don't blame the women

for our own fault you know what's crazy

y'all remember when they used to tell

us that that the story of Adam and Eve

is true and then people

are like what do you mean like to this day women

men have one less rib than women

did you know that shit was a lie

there's people out there who probably still

think that women have or men have one less

rib than women but like

but like like I

believed that shit growing up

nobody ever said that was true I love how you

speak for everybody in the world

you didn't grow up in a Christian home or whatever like that

no I've seen the full skeleton

of both a man and a woman laying next to each other

they both have the same ribs women's obviously

a little bit more compressed and they have a more

open up hips because of childbirth and stuff like that

but they have the same amount of ribs

I just learned something today yeah I'm not

I'm not criticizing you for not knowing it

I mean there's a lot of things that we learned

growing up that just aren't true

do you think there's going to be a 9-11 for

cyber security what the

fuck does that even mean how could

are you on crack cocaine

if so please

switch from baking soda to baking

powder because I swear to god

that is a weird fucking sentence to write out as a first time

chat do I think there will be

a major attack in cyber security

that could cripple the financial system yes

fuck you mean 9-11

why don't you say a Fort Sumter

October 7th of cyber security

a fucking D-Day

for cyber security like what are you doing bro

what are you doing

why is your PC dying we're all dying

USS Maine that was

bullshit the USS Maine was a

false flag operation okay

that was some bullshit

we did not they did not blow that shit

up in Havana Harbor that is the dumbest shit ever

you think Spain was sitting there in

Cuba in fucking 1898

seeing the USS Maine out in the harbor

just sitting there being like yeah let's go blow

this shit up like that's the dumbest

shit ever that was

either a false flag or that was

some miscue that hit the fucking

ammunition

room and exploded it

but we used that as to hell with Spain

remember the Maine next thing you know we go to war with Spain

fucking Rough Riders going over San Juan Hill

we go and take the Philippines you know

I don't want to get too much off track

we're off track a lot today but let's see what Trump has to say

if he goes off of uh Litecoin is up

10% today I don't own Litecoin but thank you

I learn a lot of shit on this channel

that I have to spend the rest of the day fact checking

okay you don't have to fact check

I mean you should fact check things but

don't take everything as a fuck it doesn't matter

I followed your advice and now I have

no money what advice was that

I'm trying to think what advice I could give you that

wouldn't have any money when does your

rewrite call expire oh it's

fucking dead in the water I have to roll these

I'm gonna roll them on Monday

I'm gonna see how it goes over the weekend

the only thing I bought was um

uh was uh the fig calls

earlier um they were

190 bucks

or sorry 180 bucks

they were 180 bucks they're already up

20% since then

what do you think of TTD

I'm not a fan of trade desk I said yesterday I wasn't a

fan of it I said last month I wasn't afraid of it

um I'm not afraid of it

uh fan of it um

I realized that um

that guy that I didn't even

realize was a fucking

stock person on Instagram

or whatever lost his shit

and he told everyone to go long on TTD

and they're all fucking like probably hurting

right now um

I don't like I don't like TTD

uh I realize that people are looking at it because it's down so

much but I I

you know I mean they'll melt up with the market when it goes back

up but in that sector I don't

see why anyone would choose them over their

like several other companies in that sector

no I mean there's a lot of girls

that have like uh you know

outro or audi and it can stretch

a lot

I don't know what videos you watch but I've seen them stretch

pretty far call them bat wings

that's Daniella's favorite clip what was I gonna whiteboard

I was gonna whiteboard something

ah fuck it you know what let's do something controversial you guys like

controversy alright here you go

you guys love doom and gloom

fucking

Skynet fucking big brother world's coming

to an end shit so

I've got a never ending fucking

I can't believe Kodak worked

that's wild I bought the 2027

75 calls

and up 63%

now you know I'm

you know like I'll do that shit

all day long alright

stop that fi right you

are a little bitch

uh uh uh yeah I got stopped out of

fiving I'm sorry not fi fiving

that didn't work out today probably

not the best day for it no

that listen

y'all gotta stop getting offended for other people

okay

every time I make jokes about deaf people y'all

like that's wrong I don't know

why you get offended for them they can't even fucking hear what I'm saying

you're not a hero okay

I mean they'd be offended if they could hear it but

how do you know we aren't deaf

I've always wondered if you get a handjob

from a deaf girl is it considerable

and send them to an island and let rich people hunt them

to exterminate them and raise funds that way to use

that money from the rich people to fucking help other

it's not making fun of people

it's like you're not making fun of them for being deaf

you're making fun of their limitations

in a super simple way

can you explain why you get calls that expire soon

when you can get on the expires a year from now if you believe

in something long term you always do that

almost everything I have is

long term the only time I would get something within

30 days of expiring is if I'm planning on trading it

that day only

and that way I give myself a buffer

in case I'm wrong but

it's

I don't want to hold that position long so

most of everything I own

the shortest dated thing I own right now

I think is January and then I have stuff

all the way out to 2028

I'm actually coming back pretty good right now

my Divi portfolio is going really good

OMO Walmart's up 1%

Chewy's up VTR's up

Does Stocki invest in crypto? Anyone know?

I invest more in companies that

crypto miners and companies that deal with blockchain

technology but I do have crypto investments

I mean I have Ethereum I've had for years

I have some Bitcoin that I've had since

$6,000 and

now I've opened up a position in Bonk

but my two biggest holdings

in crypto are Ethereum and Solana

Did you change your house? It's been a while since I tuned in

Nah this is just a new green screen we got

because everybody was complaining about the background

Alright so here real quick while we're waiting on Trump

This guy's having a tough day

Okay alright

Got one for you ladies and gentlemen

Will needs a fucking a good

we got a lot of good clips that he never gets but

uh he needs another one

And you know something? What sells better than

sex? Fear

Ladies and gentlemen welcome to

the future that's right

Tinder you know the app where

you used to you used to used to hook up

with people and pretend like it didn't happen

especially when you hooked up with somebody ugly but you still banged

them because nobody knows and you just delete

their you block them when you get home

Ladies and gentlemen Tinder has

uh is now rolling out a new feature

that's right

people are desperate for dates right now

because people don't know how to fucking be themselves

and go places where people actually

enjoy things they enjoy you know what I mean

like I don't know go on meetup

or go on fucking you know uh

Eventbrite and find you know

things nearby that people

are going to that you're interested in you'll go there

and you'll be interested and be yourself

and find other people that are also interested in something you're interested

in and then you get to talking over a similar

interest and then you butt a relationship

out of that instead of fucking

overpaying with money you don't have to go to a club

to drink beer or booze you

don't like to try to hook up with some chick who's

also doing the same and then you all either do

hook up or don't hook up and you either go home

broke or you go home and get an

STD or you get into a toxic relationship

and wonder why the dating world

is so fucking hard it's not hard stop faking

who you are to meet people who are faking who they are

go be yourself and meet people who are being themselves okay

sorry I'm blacking out here I'm a boomer

Tinder ladies and gentlemen is rolling out a

new future feature

okay rolling out

a new feature that is right

Tinder will now

allow or if you allow it will

now find you matches

based on your camera roll

that's right Tinder

is now going to have a feature where

AI

scans

your entire

camera roll

to find

you matches

that's right that's what they're going to do

what they're saying is AI is going to go through your entire

camera roll and see the places that

you like to go the drinks that you like

the type of people you hang out with where you go to

concerts where you hike if you like

and they're going to scan all that and they're just going to

innocently make a profile

for you and they find other people

who have this feature and say wow this

person also has a lot of pictures at

you know hiking in the woods or with a dog

or out on

a cruise or drinking at a bar and stuff like that

that's what they're going to do

that's what they're going to do okay

ladies

I seriously doubt any of you have this man

let me give you a little piece of advice never send a dick

pic to a chick unless you ask for it I don't

know why people do that that is such a fucking

weird thing I think it's because we think

to ourselves man if a girl sends me

an unsolicited titty picture I'd love

that I'm going to send her a picture

of my fucking shaved weevil

okay no

it's not even shaved it's probably hairy as shit

nobody wants your fucking dick pic it's not

attractive okay

the only time a woman finds a penis attractive

is when she's really fucking horny okay or

ovulating or she's really into

the guy she doesn't want to see your fucking dong

okay stop sending that shit okay it's

never fuck no guy has ever just been like

hey I just met this chick let me take

a picture of my fucking wrinkly

sack and my fucking

meat fucking

my sausage encasing

that's floppy and send it to her

and she's going to want me that doesn't work that

way okay alright way to ruin

any confidence a

beaster I just realized

I just noticed that every time I look down I see somebody

with like a really fucking dumb or stupid

fucking take today it's been you and then I just

realized you're doing it on purpose so I'm going to ignore you now

alright alright

there is never going to be a time

where you just met a chick and

you're like I'm going to send her a picture of my dick

she didn't ask for it

she didn't even mention that she wants to see

my penis I'm going to send it to her

and she's going to love this no okay

let me save you that trouble ladies if you

do have them though stored because you did want

some and they're there just know they're going to match you

with guys who like to send out dick pics okay

so be careful but no jokes

aside this is a new feature tinder is rolling

out they're thinking

that this is going to help make it better

right people complain about the

bots they complain about the the matches

that people aren't who they say they are and stuff like that well

how do you find out who somebody really is

go through everything that they've they've

taken a picture of with themselves in

that's who they really are

you're going to cut through the bullshit find the real

genuine people who genuinely are just like you

okay

so although it'd be

you know you got to be careful because it'd be like if you got

pictures with your kids and then you match

with some creepy guy down the road who also has pictures

of your kids at least you'd be able

to find out who the guy on the block that needs to be

fucking ran out of town is alright

but or pictures

of your wife and some guy also has pictures

of your wife with him

and it's like wait a second what

but they're going to do this they think this is going to work

out so what they want to do is you opt

into it you give them access to your camera roll

AI goes through and scans all of your

pictures and basically finds out

what is it that you like do you take

a lot of pictures of you hiking

do you go a lot of pictures at the

at the bars okay

do you pictures with dogs

um

fishing any of that stuff and then

they're going to go and find other people

that have the same you know feature

and try to match you based on

the things that you do the things that you like

the things that you're involved in

now it sounds cool

and some people are down bad and desperate

and they're like fuck it I've tried everything else

I got to get my dick wet and I don't have enough money to go pay for

for a hooker that has

all her teeth and isn't fucking you know

missing a leg but that's what

they're going to do this is some

dystopian shit but it also

makes sense I can't I can't

not at least admit that

for some people this is probably what they need

wouldn't Google do the same

but better have AI access

the Google photos and

Apple photos Google doesn't

have a dating service it doesn't have the name and the user base

that Tinder does

oh I'm sorry is there

I can't hear in my headphones for some reason

is this whiteboard pitching

Tinder for dogs no

so yeah so that's what they're doing

they're going to take AI

you give it access to your

camera roll they scan everything

and try to find matches for you

based on other people who

also have the same things in their photos

thinking that that's going to match with you

and that's how you get legit people

and matching

this is real you turn it

off and MS seems to have built

links to your files anyways probably

how did you meet your wife again arranged

marriage motherfucker do I

do I look like the kind of person that any

any mother and father would look

and say that's who I want my daughter to

marry think about that for a second

do you really think

a mother and a father

would look at somebody like me and say

this is who I want my daughter

to spend the rest of her life with

you're white and rich first of all

when my wife and I met

she was making double what I was making

I was making less than 20

bucks an hour when we met

you can sell chicken shit to chickens

you are perfect I can't even sell myself

or to advertisers

and sponsors or

sell a course or sell my thing

I'm so bad at marketing myself

she bought the dip yep

she knew your potential fuck you

I bet you got a tight anus though

I don't know how to measure that

like how would I know like

PSI I'll measure it

for you okay that's just weird

you're the person she dates to get back at her parents

Lord I'm at work

I can't you're not supposed to listen

to this without headphones

PSI shut up quits

you all need some help

today I learned stocky is a dime sized asshole

what the fuck okay

so yeah new feature

I'm not even kidding you guys think I'm making this shit

up or something like that I'm trying to just create content

no this is a real thing I post these

things in stocky's daily news whenever I come across them

well here you go

so here you are tinder's AI

can find better matches by scanning your camera

roll they're testing new features lets you know users by

analyzing their photos it's a AI

powered chemistry feature that learns about your

interests and personalize your camera roll

the dating app match.com described it as

an interactive feature matching feature

that's designed to combat swipe fatigue by surfacing

fewer more compatible matches

yeah oh

you're looking at me sorry so

what I would say is

is if you are planning on using this feature because I could

see a case why

where this would be useful

I'm not even going to lie to you

you know if you keep matching

with the wrong people probably because you

don't really

understand yourself but

why can't I hear out of my right left ear

so

it's actually a feature that I could

see being used for I would never

do it but I could see people that would especially people that

are down bad

please please please go through and fucking delete

like go through the feature

that you can search by

by word

and find out like there's a game in

discord these guys like to play sometimes where

they do exclamation point roll

and then hit the number 1000

and any I have to

whatever number it gives I have to go through my

camera roll and find that exact picture as long as

it's not like my family or my kids or like

you know something risque with my wife or something

and I have to post it and it's

very embarrassing because my camera roll is

horrible they also like to play a game

where they go through and they choose a word

and I have to find the first picture that

comes up with that word you're

going to want to do that and delete some pictures

okay that's

actually a marbles win

redemption 2 somebody can actually do that it happened

one time and I was like that's a bad idea

so shoes yeah like if

I go through here that's probably

not a bad one shoes

oh shit why

I don't have to show it right because it's not a redemption

channel point redemption or something

why is that why did that show up as my first

picture on shoes okay

for some reason that's the first thing that popped up when I

wrote shoes I don't know I

I

listen listen it probably

I don't know why that's

the first thing in my camera roll that popped up when I wrote

shoes so

I think it was because I was talking about

cosplaying at

I just failed nnn no

what color were the shoes white

if I use channel points

for an AMA can I get

you to post a picture

this wasn't supposed to

first time here I thought you were supposed to talk about

stocks not hot girls

you've been following me since August of 2021

shut the fuck up and we're not talking about it

I was explaining this is

actually relevant because I was

talking about camera rolls and

tinder and which is a publicly

traded company and this is just part of

that mixture 20 minutes ago

you had no idea that this was

a feature you've now been

educated on it it's a cool thing to

piece of knowledge you might be able to bring it up in a

conversation and you also

know that I have a camera roll that camera that

can one of y'all like burn

my phone if something

happens to me type in

stocks no no

no no no no no no no no no no no no we're not doing

this anymore no we're not doing this anymore

we're not fucking doing this anymore nope

nope nope nope nope we're done we're done we're done

we're done we're done we're done we're done we're done we're done

we're done we're done we're done we're done we're done we're done

we're done we're done we're done we're done

I'm not playing this game anymore because

this is this is a screenshot

of I can't

show it on stream I can't show it on stream

it's a screenshot because

I had to delete

a channel from our discord called movies

and music movies and TV

and we allowed people to stream

in our discord

and I hovered over it and it

showed a screenshot of

what was being watched, and because of that, I had to

delete the... Yeah, we gotta

stop this game. Yeah, it was

porn. Yes, it was porn. Somebody was watching porn.

And I had to take a screenshot of the Discord

hover of what was going

on without opening it up, because obviously I wasn't

gonna do it at home like that,

and to post to the mods. So,

describe it at least.

It's literally in Trader General chat

right now. You can go look at it. Austin, shut up.

Yes, it says I have mild

ADHD on top. Yes.

Post it in Dgen chat. No, guys,

that's not... Okay, fine.

Here. Somebody above it

was typing I have mild ADHD. There you go.

Fine. There you are. Fuck it. You guys don't have it.

The crazy thing was, is that

in that screenshot, one of the five

people in there was one of our mods at the time.

He's no longer a mod.

Yes, it's tame, but not for Twitch.

God forbid people want to

goon with the boys. No, we're not doing this right now.

What did my...

What did one of my lady mods

just say? Sometimes you need a group

porn session with the homies. Thank you, Tina.

Thank you. Stop saying

W, Tina. That's our

weather bit... Witch. That's our weather witch. Yes.

Quits, didn't you post a

picture of your butt in Discord once? Shut up.

You don't act like you're better.

Dgen Fridays are back. Oh, shit, you're right.

We do gotta do some stuff. Alright, well, we're waiting.

Alright, so we're gonna talk news and

stuff that

people have sent in to me. Good sell on Chewy earlier.

What is going on with Kodak?

I don't know why we're making money on this.

FI's doing well today. We have calls on both of those.

At least something's helping out.

No, we have a partner Discord, and we have way too many people

on our Discord. The amount of money

some of these companies want to pay me to advertise

in Discord's insane. Holy

shit. These guys don't

play around. I don't...

I have a rule. You can't advertise. There's no advertising

in my Discord. But because we have so many

people and because it's finance-related, like,

dude, the amount of money that they offer

to fucking advertise in the Discord is insane.

It's insane.

Um,

should I close my Walmart weeklies? Are you still...

You're at Walmart weeklies? Have you ever discussed

what happens... What is... You put at stocky.

That's not me. Have you ever discussed what happens

in the world, uh, reserve currency moves

off the US dollar? Well, it depends

on what you mean. Fully move off of it? Also in

in tandem with the Petro

dollar being wiped out? And what

is... Are they trading off instead? Is it gold

or is it another type of currency?

Like, how much? Ad money is stupid?

Um, I got

offered $50,000.

To put an ad in

one of the top channels of

Discord for 30 days.

I didn't have to do anything else. All I had to

do was is put... Is... Is

make a channel at the top of my Discord

channel... Discord. And

it's... And all it was is the...

It was an ad for the company

for 30 days for $50,000.

Nah. No.

It wasn't something that I could... Number one, I don't

advertise in the Discord because I want Discord

to be a place where people feel like they can just go

in and talk. Uh, but...

But now it's kind of different because Discord actually advertises.

I did make

an exception one time,

but only because

the... The... The... The company

that I was doing it with was not

like, um...

Not like... It was a... It was a legit financial company,

but it wasn't me advertising their platform.

It was me, uh,

advertising that I was going to be doing a talk

in a different Discord

about the intro

to personal finance. So I was doing a talk,

uh, for personal finance,

uh, one basic finance, personal finance

101. Like, understanding the difference between a 401k

and IRA and a Roth and a... And a traditional.

Understanding, um,

you know, uh, what a

management fee is. Understanding,

um, compounding

interest. Understanding, uh,

you know, the...

You know, how... Penalty and taxes

from withdrawal and stuff like that. Like the

intro... An intro into personal

finance. And so

I wasn't advertising the company,

but I was advertising that I was...

I was going to be doing a talk

in their Discord. So that was a little bit different,

but it was only, uh, for a couple

days. So it wasn't like an ad. It was just a

hey, listen, guys that are in my Discord,

I'm going to be doing this talk that you might be

interested in because you may not watch my stream in this other

Discord. So that was the only thing.

You gave financial advice for the right price.

This is what a 401k

is. That's like going

to a history teacher and saying,

hey, you just explained

what led up to World War II.

So you're saying the

Nazis were right. What? What the

fuck? Explaining

something is not telling somebody

to do something or endorsing something.

Dipshit. But yes, I am

giving you financial advice. What are you going to do about it?

You're going to sue me? Fuck off.

Alright. Um,

was there ever one, uh,

was there ever a sponsor you turned

down that you regret? Maybe

one. I will, thank you.

Oh, God, I can't wait to see that judge.

You're suing this guy because he said

you should dollar cost average into the market.

Yes. And why are you

suing him? Because the market's down.

Oh, so you paid him as a financial

advisor? No.

Did he claim he was a financial advisor? No.

Is he a licensed financial advisor?

No. Did he

make you feel like he was an financial advisor

and then take your money in return for giving you

specific financial advice for your money?

No. Get the fuck out of my

courtroom. Alright.

Do you normally add people when they join

your Discord, Sussy? No. Um,

unfortunately, it's not our Discord, but,

unfortunately, there are

bots out there on Discord

as a whole, and if they

see that you join a stock

related, um, Discord,

they're not in our Discord, but they'll try to add you

as a friend. I will never add you as a friend.

It's not because I don't like you, it's because I

literally can't add any friends. I had

this problem with, uh, with my

agent yesterday. They said, hey, can you add me

as a friend so I can add you to this group?

And I couldn't do it. Like,

I'm still trying to delete some of you guys, but

this is the problem I have.

It's not a boomer moment. I said, I'm

legit not allowed to add friends. Discord says

I have too many people. I've been deleting one by one

but still over 2,000. I cannot

add anybody. I'm glad

I got out of this casino while I still could.

I'm gonna see how that ages

in, uh, in a couple months.

You can't delete. They will not let you

delete, uh, multiples. You have to delete

it one by one. You

legit have to delete them one

by one.

Imagine having paper hands while holding nothing but index

funds. Some people feel that way, but

I remember in April on the way down, people

said the same thing. Oh, I'm so glad I sold here.

Oh, I can't wait to see this happen. I'm glad I'm out of

this shit. And then the market ran 45% and they're

like, you know,

never sell. Just buy the dips.

Time to buy more D Pro.

I added some D Pro. Can you talk

more about GTA 6? No, there's nothing to talk about.

Although somebody did say this morning, we got

stocky in Delaware before GTA 6.

If never sell, then why do

institutions? Oh, fuck. Okay, I gotta delete

him. Don't forget to sell

your quantum stocks today.

In fact, if you sold your quantum stocks

this day, you would have

missed out on a massive run. Massive

run. Don't forget to short

quantum. The top is in.

Huh? They all tanking today.

Fuck pickleball. Are you okay?

Gaza being razed to the

ground. Americans are worried about the Cracker Barrel logo.

Joby is a fake

company. Buy

SRPT. It's down

50% since then.

PCG. Down 15%.

CDNA.

You said that on July

18th, the day before it

fell 60%.

I'm not roasting you, bro, because

we all get them wrong. I get them wrong, too.

It's just your very, very

matter-of-fact

on everything, and I'm curious why.

It's never, hey, this might happen, or hey,

no, this is what's gonna happen.

That's what's gonna happen.

Wait, why is every single one

of your plays the same as that, what's his

name? Skreli, there you go.

Everything you're saying is just a copy

of his Twitter.

He took open shorts. I actually took open puts before

him, but he took open puts. Okay, open

short. He's been saying short quantum.

You're telling everybody to short quantum every day.

I own Q's a fake company.

He's been saying it's IOA. Sorry, is this

Skreli, is this your

account since, you know,

what you said to me, or is this just somebody who just

just copies

everything he says? I don't know. I'm asking.

Because every single thing here is the exact same

that he says. What did Skreli tell you?

Nothing.

I never have interacted

with him, but he once got

very upset that I have a high viewership on

Twitch, and

there was a clip of him saying

that he didn't understand

why people didn't watch him,

that he

knows the stock market, and that

there's some guy on Twitch who

talks about stocks who knows absolutely

nothing, but every time he goes live, he

has over 2,000 viewers, and

that he knows nothing.

He knows nothing. I know,

I know the market. I know everything about the market.

For some reason, he found the formula to make

people, you know, listen to him or whatever.

And so I was like, well, maybe

he was just rage baiting, or maybe he's

right, though. I mean, I, you know,

there's a lot of shit I don't know. I just admit it.

So I raided him one day, and he just

ignored it. So I was like, okay, maybe he doesn't want to

be in the same ecosystem. So I was

like, okay. Alright.

So we talked about Tinder. AAON

still going. Kodak.

How did we get so lucky on Kodak?

I mean, I know we got, I know

we got into it because of the loot, the IRL

loot boxes, but Jesus, I was not expecting

it like this. We're up 90%

on 2027 leaps now.

That's crazy. Alright, let's see if, let's

see if, um, I'm not

taking any spy calls right here,

but let's see if, uh,

let's see if, uh, Trump

says some shit about

Hungary and critical minerals or something

like that, and see if we get a little

rebound here. I don't know if we will,

but let's see. Why

not? Because I,

I'm, I'm sitting back. I'm sitting back.

I'm not in a rush to catch

the bottom right here. I've, I've

dollar cost average, and I bought an extra share of

VOO today when it went 1% down,

but I'm not in a rush. There's

another trading day on Monday. You're not gonna,

it's not gonna be the last chance to get into the market.

Even if there is something that happens and it bounces today

or over the weekend and Monday, cool.

Catch it on the way up. There's so many

people that are new to this that are like, I have to catch

every, every bottom or sell every

top or I gotta be in it. What if I miss out?

You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be

fine. There's plenty of days to trade. You're not

gonna miss out on gains the rest of the year.

Okay. Uh, Atriok

had Lina Khan on his stream

twice, and now she is appointed to Mondami's

transition team. Would you want to reach out and

talk to her about her antitrust actions?

Why are you asking me if I want to do

something? I won't remember any of that stuff. And what does that have to do

with Atriok? Is that something like, I don't understand

the, the, the thing there.

Atriok and I are supposed to, um,

do something. Yeah, but didn't,

yeah, didn't he, but you just said he had an interview, so what would

be the point of me having her on?

Ask the same questions. Why do people prefer

candlestick over line charts or so believe?

Because for me, it gives me more

understanding of the action during, well, I can watch

the candle better and see where the price

action is according to the volume before I

make a decision. Stocky, you

moved to northern Delaware, or

are you in slower lower? You

belong in slower lower. I don't

know if you mean because, like, of my, like, I'm

like, my, here's slower, or

just, like, down there. Honestly, we're

in north of Wilmington, but

we're in an area where it's very, very

quiet, very clean. I mean, it's nice.

I want to go even more, um,

more, uh, rural. I want to go

to Hocasin. That's, like, that's where I want to be.

Thank God you finally drew

a line. Do I ever use

MAs? Wouldn't that help know when

to buy? If the MA

told you when you should buy and sell,

everybody that uses it would be a billionaire.

Um, you know, Hocasin was great. We went there for

4th of July, and we went to a little baseball

field there. It was beautiful. We had some pizza there.

I met some people that worked at a pizza, or a chicken

shop there. Um, it was

nice. It was really nice. It's, like, kind of rural,

but, like, rural

in between lots of cities, you know what I mean?

And the schools are really good. The education

is really good up there. It's quieter. It's

quainter. The thing is, is people are like,

Stocky, you're gonna move to Delaware

and there's nothing to do.

Motherfucker, I got kids.

I got small kids. You

think I'm out partying

and shit? You think I want to be around the

clubs and the bars and the fucking

bustling nightlife? Bitch, I'm putting

the kids to sleep at 930.

What are you talking about?

My life has, I have nothing

to do outside. As long as I'm close to a fucking gas

station, a grocery store, and

a gym, that's all I give a shit about.

I don't understand this whole thing. Like,

like, like, people stop themselves from going places

because they're like, oh, well, I remember when I was

younger. I don't want to lose that.

I don't want to lose that. You already lost it, bro.

You have a career. You lost

half of it. You got, you got kids.

You lost 95% of it. You're married.

The other 5% is gone. Okay?

You ain't, that ain't you anymore.

I know it's hard to let go, but it ain't you anymore.

Now, you can fight it

and waste all that money trying to

trying to capture something that you can't capture

that's gone. But instead of being

sad that that's over, how about you appreciate

and be happy with what you got and focus on that?

And then it changes the game. Damn,

that was real. I'm sorry. I don't even know what I just said. I blacked out.

Is there wood to rob

near you? Yeah, I got some from the high school

yesterday. So there's a big park.

I'm going to be honest with you. Bellevue State

Park is the nicest park I've ever been to.

It is the nicest park I have ever

fucking been to. So

there's a high school right next to it. And I

parked there with the kids. And

there's a big baseball field. So we thought we'd walk around

the baseball field to go into the thing.

But there's a giant wall. So when we came back, there

was like wood on the ground from the tree.

And I'm like, we should build a fire. So I said, kids, grab

some wood. And so they did. And we ran to the car and

threw it in. But then I took them to Bellevue State

Park. And dude, that, we came in

and the first thing we saw, it was, there was nobody there.

We saw a deer. And the kids loved that.

Then we went and parked up at the main parking lot. And right next

to it was a big corral with horses and ponies.

And we got out and we walked out. And as soon

as we walk out, there's a giant trail that goes around.

It's a huge park. And there was a lake

with a bridge.

And there was like six different

little playgrounds right there. And there

was just fields as far as you could see. And

it was just like, holy shit, this is

amazing. I'll never go to

it, even though it's nearby

because just like when we lived near the beach, we never went to it.

But it was the most, it was the nicest park I've ever been to.

Bah, made the children accomplices.

What are they gonna do?

First off, it was after school was over. The

only people

there were the ROTC kids fucking

learning how to tie a rope to a tree.

That's real fucking practical. And

the marching band on the other side of the

parking lot practicing for the game. I didn't know they had that

night. What are you gonna do? Be a teacher and be like,

excuse me, sir? You look

old enough to have like kids and like seniors

in high school. Do you have kids that go

here? No, he's with his kids. Oh, they're playing.

They're grabbing wood. Oh, it must be a game they're playing.

You're putting in your car. Hey, sir, your

two and four year old can't take a dead

stick on the ground home with you. Fuck out

of here, fucking professor. You're gonna be

dead before you're 40 because you're gonna have a heart attack

because of the shit your kids, the kids put you

through. All right, fuck out of here.

I should tell my four year old to say

fuck you, professor, or fuck you,

teacher. You can't do shit just

so you feel like it's during the school day again. Okay,

I'm being toxic. Let's do marbles and then

why didn't I take the spy calls? I literally

drew the, I haven't drawn a line

all day. First line I

draw. Thanks for the call, Stocky.

Shut up, Java. I mean, we did good today.

Chewy came out of nowhere. Those calls

we sold for a good profit. Walmart came

roaring back. JetBlue did well.

Helena

Troy is doing good. Kodak absolutely

exploded. Our Hive calls we got yesterday are

doing good. Piton had great earnings. We did well.

Mir is up. I am getting kicked

in the nuts on VRNS,

Rivian,

Joby, and FI,

and AEHR, but I bought the dip on AEHR.

Glad we sold those Pinterest calls

yesterday. Holy fuck, that came back down too.

I did add to Fig for the weekend.

Fig is my weekend play.

30% on the spy calls

now.

Let's go. Come on.

Oh, Jesus. I just realized Sarah's name is there with

my old ass in the shower.

Alright. Whoops.

It's so funny because

Sarah and her husband both watch my show.

I'm glad they're both good sports about it.

Why do you call it a show?

What the fuck am I supposed to call it?

It's not a scripted show.

As if you couldn't tell.

One big blackout.

Calm down, big guy. I'm calm.

I'm just curious what that person

would call it.

A song in Discord?

You don't get to do fucking song requests?

Not until I get another booty pic.

Alright, let's go, guys.

Come on, get in. Pay up.

Nah, I'm just kidding. Let me see where this is.

Damn, never gonna happen.

It was one and done. We'll see.

Alright. Get in, get in, get in, get in.

Hurry up.

I have no idea.

I'm sure he's been busy.

Um...

I got spy calls at the bottom.

Did you use the casting?

No, but now that my wife found out

that we have this mirror back here,

now she's all getting, like, all interested.

Like, see, we have a mirror.

A big mirror, and there's the couch.

And so I told her, I said,

and she goes,

I was like, yeah, okay, guy.

That's too far.

The mirror from there? You don't think I'm gonna move that couch

closer when I... You don't think that's the only couch?

You know how many couches I got down here, bro?

I'm gonna break... I call my wife my little,

my pinky toe. She goes, why do you call me

pinky toe? I said, because I'm gonna bang you on every piece

of furniture in this house. Look at this.

We got a couch there. We got a chair there.

We got a couch there. We got a recliner there.

We got a couch over there. Fuck, you think that this thing's going to...

I'm about to put tarp down on the floor in this fucking room.

I hate it here. I know.

Bring back the movies channel? No.

Alright, uh, we're still waiting

for, um,

Trump to talk. How did you know that

that was the bottom of spy? I didn't.

I had no fucking clue.

I think when that guy said he's out...

No, it's just basically

Trump getting ready to talk.

I don't know. I just guessed.

It's because the line was drawn? No.

Are you renting that furniture? Well, technically.

What advice, content, research would you recommend

for someone who wants to learn more about investing past

just putting money in the S&P?

Um, it's hard to answer that.

I'm gonna be honest with you. It's a vibe market right now.

The way I invest

is I have different types of investments.

I have, like, dividend investing and defensive in case

for safety. I have growth

stocks based on

trends and stuff like that.

There's a lot there.

You know, the best thing you can do

is just... Here's what I would

say. Find you four

or five stocks. Decent companies.

And trade only

those. That way you can

understand without stretching yourself

too thin and trying to keep up with all this stuff

how these stocks, and they're all in different

sectors, how they perform based on

their earnings, how they perform

based on their competitors, the sector,

the overall market, how they're

affected by news and stuff like that. And once you can

you can kind of master,

you never master it, but kind of understand

how these stocks move

based on other things, then you can

kind of understand how stocks move

elsewhere. It's probably the best way of launching it.

The problem is everybody jumps in and FOMOs

into every stock somebody's talking about and overextends

themselves. Next thing you know, they have 45 positions. They don't know

which one's doing what. They're hoping. They can't keep up with it.

They can't read up on it. They can't babysit it.

They just do it, you know?

Or they come into the morning call and they're like, alright, did I have any update

on something I own? Okay, that's cool, you know?

Where's our $2 gas

Cheeto and Chief promised?

You're asking a fucking guy in his basement

where the $2 gas the president

promised is? First time

chatter, are you okay? Why are you asking me

where it is? I don't fucking know where it is.

Your show is a rough watch

these days, bud.

What makes it a rough watch for you?

The fact that I told that guy to find four or five

stocks? If anything, I feel

like this is the best the show's ever been. We got a good mix

of everything. Everybody's having a good time.

No, I'm honestly curious. I'm curious what makes you think

that my show's gotten so bad.

I'd love to hear it. I take

constructive criticism very, very,

very good. I always love to hear it.

Did you buy a new desk for the house?

No, we're renting a house and everything

in the house is just

with the house. It's like, it's like a, it's called Furnace

Finder. It's like a long-term Airbnb.

When are gas prices coming down? 1500%

or more. Funny, fun thing about

funny thing about gas prices is, is that

oil is actually super low.

Oil's bad. Regulations have gone

up. Demand is still up there.

But, oil prices are low.

But there's a lot of other factors that go

into it. Inflation's part of it too.

That guy's not going to answer your question. He was just

trying to rage bait you. Okay, I don't know.

Alright, let me go into

our grab bag of people that have sent

things in over the week that we missed.

Are you still bullish on WeRide? It's not

that I'm bullish. It's that I have a theory

that WeRide is going to get brought

into the fold for NVIDIA, especially now that NVIDIA's

partnering with Uber for robo-taxis. I don't know how long

it's going to be. And it's not about

the company itself. It's at the potential for

WeRide because of the NVIDIA

investment to be something that is,

it's pushed by NVIDIA down the road

for autonomous vehicles and robo-taxis. And robo-taxis

are gaining a lot of steam, especially

internationally. And look at Waymo

here too. They're exponentially going

up in rides. So, it's more

so the NVIDIA investment

and to see if they bring them into the fold. That's the only thing.

It's real speculative for me.

Thoughts on ARK?

I'm not a fan of

the way that Cathy

invests.

But, again,

you know, looking at it

from a five-year time,

frame and the type of market we have now,

it's hard for me to really look and say she's

good or bad at it. Because

we all talk about

how she's underperforming a lot

of other people. But at the same time,

a five-year

snapshot in the

volatility that we've had is really, really

hard to look at it. I mean, you can look back at like Warren Buffett

and Berkshire. In the beginning, there

were many other people that outperformed them. But over

time, it got better. I'm not saying Cathy's

anything like Warren Buffett. But to

analyze

the ARK ETF

in this short time frame,

it would be just

intellectually dishonest.

Best finance movie or series?

Best finance movie?

I mean, everyone says the big short because

it was so like

a lot of us lived through it and it was so

cool to see the behind the scenes.

Wolf of Wall Street

was so much bullshit. It literally

painted it completely opposite of what

it was. So if you mean like most

entertaining, Margin Call

was better. Yeah, but it was too slow for a lot of people.

Wall Street, Michael Douglas. That was kind of interesting.

My favorite movie

that one of my favorite things

in a movie that I saw was the movie

Southpaw

with Jake Gyllenhaal.

It really showed

a lot of

why people that are young and

successful and have a lot of money need to be careful

with their money because they just lose everything. And it really

showed how something I teach

people a lot and I need to

open up to doing

talks with professional

sports teams and businesses and stuff like that.

There's a lot of money in that to explain how that

works.

But watching

that thing where this guy's young and successful

and has everything and everybody around him is so

nice to him and talking to him and stuff like that and then

he

loses it

because of the, I'm not going to

spoil the movie for anybody, and then everybody

disappears and everything is gone.

And he loses literally everything.

And it's a,

it's a good example of why you can't

get complacent and why

you've got to realize that success can be very

fleeting. I think the most

interesting movie that I watched that's money

related in the past couple years was

Uncut Gems. I

like that movie. That was

a deep movie.

That was a deep movie. Damn, I was

really hoping that guy would give me a little insight into

why he's so angry.

Check out Black Rabbit on Netflix. I

started it. I don't have time to watch those things now.

I started like the first half of the first episode. I got to the

part where

the guys got robbed and that was as far as I got.

You talking about me? I'm not angry? No, no, no, no.

The Matrix guy. He said my show,

my stream is a rough watch these days.

I was just curious what he meant by that.

Alright, while we're waiting on Trump,

because I still haven't heard him in the background yet

with the Hungarian, I'm wondering if we get any,

I have this weird feeling.

Wait, did he not meet with him?

Or did I miss it? What do you plan to do

after you're done streaming? I don't

know, man. Hopefully that's

a long time from now. I guess

they canceled it. I was hoping they

would talk about Rare Earth

because it feels like they're going to try and cut a deal

with Hungary there.

Oh, AAON still going. Let's go, guys.

Let's go. Let's fucking

go. Or did I get, no, I didn't

get stopped out because I'm holding this for a swing

trade. This is another one of those

speculative things. I talked about

this before. This was my main

play today, but I want to

keep some of these shares.

The reason is because they do

industrial and commercial HVACs.

And data centers are going to need to

be cooled. And I wonder

if AAON is going

to be one of the ones that tap

into that. Now, we're talking years down the line, but

no one's been talking about the cooling systems

for these data centers.

And they're so big and they're going up so fast, they're going

to have to contract that out. And I'm really

curious if AAON gets a piece of that.

I'm really curious to see if they do.

I could see Saki come up with a news service.

I think Kramer meets The Daily Show.

I could do something like that, like

a one-hour stream or live stream

every evening where it's

me doing

the morning call, but as the

stream and just doing

finance news of the day or

whatever in my way of doing it

for an hour. That could be something I could do because that would be

something that would be in the

evening. It wouldn't take my whole day or something like that.

That would be a cool thing.

You should do a news wrap once a week,

live stream, but also on YouTube.

Everyone has been talking about cooling. I know

three companies off the top of my head that focus on data center

HVAC. Okay, thank you, Darcirc.

I must be watching all of the

wrong things and reading all

of the wrong headlines because I don't see

HVAC cooling stocks

nearly as much as the chips,

the building, the infrastructure,

the GPUs. I'm just

saying that it's not something that

the retail world is getting

a lot of exposure about. No one is

talking about all of the

cooling, right?

We got a lot of talk when

because the data centers haven't been built yet. Most of them haven't been built

yet. They're just planned to be built.

The dredging, yeah, we made money on that.

Do you think it's bad to hold multiple

ETFs covering the S&P

500? No, it depends.

I have a couple Vanguard

growth and small cap

index funds as well.

Check the White House official tournament.

Okay, White House. It says fundraiser.

Alright, while we're

waiting, we'll do a couple Zillow's call-ins

and write-ins.

This is the part of the show where you can send me a

Zillow. You can call me directly on Discord. Nobody will know

it was you. It is completely anonymous.

Call in and you can ask for advice on something

if you want my advice on it for some reason.

If you want opinion on something, if you want me to rate

something, if you want to tell me

I'm wrong about something, educate me on something, debate

me on something, tell me to shut up and listen about

something. If you want to get something off your chest,

you're going through something in your life. You just need somebody to

fucking talk to or bounce off. Whatever

you want. You're welcome to call me directly. I'll pick it up and do

that. A Zillow or if you're not comfortable

talking, you can write it in or you can

check my emails that I get sometimes

as well as a backlog of things that people

have sent me and we'll take a look at that until

Trump gets

here to the thing. So I'm going to go ahead and jump right into it.

First thing I got was

is... let's see what

this is. Stocky,

my wife just

recently took up mountain biking. I'm thinking about

doing the same ever since you've been talking about getting in

shape. It's a fun activity.

I just watched

a video that she had from when she went out

on a solo trip and now I really want

to get into it. Can you please listen and not

watch? What the fuck? Listen and

not watch.

Okay, asshole. I know it. Now I understand. It's not bad when you watch it. And this isn't your wife. This is...

Why do you call me pinky toe? I said because I'm going to bang you on every piece of furniture in this house. Look at this. We got a couch there. We got a chair there. We got a couch there. We got a recliner there. We got a couch over there. You think that this thing is going to... I'm about to put tarp down on the floor in this fucking room.

You know that guy earlier?

Who said my stream has gotten really hard to watch?

I think I understand now. This is

why... Here's the

fucked up part. This is

literally a GoPro

cam or video of somebody

mountain biking and excited about

it. But we're so

fucking immature

that we can't

understand that.

Okay? Like we can't even

watch it for what it is.

And again, this is why you can

never listen to me

outside without headphones on,

especially at work. Because nothing

about this is wrong. There's nothing perverted

about this. This is just somebody out in the cold

and like, you know,

anxious about going through deep water. And we

can't... Guys, please don't send me shit

like that. Okay.

Alright, next one.

Stocky, I saw this and

reminded me of your motivational

talks as well as your wife.

My... What was my wife?

You mean like my wife's motivational? Just...

What is this? Okay, bro.

Fuck your client's

feedback. You should

pay no attention to what they have

to say. Your clients

are fucking clueless.

Is this the launch...

Is this the launch of my course?

My stock trading course?

They have no idea what they

want. In the past

they did not know and in

the future they will still not know.

If you take your client's

feedback seriously,

it will only bring you agony

and pain. Alright, to the

guy who said my show is getting hard to watch,

fuck you. I don't care what you have to say.

Sit there and watch like a good boy.

Give me your money, you little piggy.

Instead, you

should only pretend to give a

fuck about what they have to say.

Perfect! Oh

my god! This is like... This is being a

streamer. This is like... This is him

talking to me about chat. And still

do what you feel is best.

Fuck your clueless

clients and their feedback.

That is all.

Fuck your clients' feedback.

This is my guru guru. You should

pay no attention to what they have

to say. Your clients

are fucking... Remember how

I told you, if you want to get rich,

lie to those who want to be lied to. If you want to make a living,

tell the truth to those who want to hear the truth. And if you want to go broke,

tell the truth to people who want to be lied to.

This is exactly this.

If you are sick

and tired of your boss,

your co-workers,

and your clients' bullshit,

then you need to take a sick

day. Sick days

are not all...

Don't go to work

if you don't want to go to work.

If you are ready

at work, and you don't want to

be at work, then fuck it.

Go home.

If your boss asks why you are leaving,

tell them it is because

you are preserving your mental health.

Tell them because

the toxic work environment

is making it hard for you to breathe.

Or tell your boss that

a shitty attitude

is making you physically sick.

If you don't have a good reason,

make a reason up.

Tell them it is climate change.

Or because of Taylor Swift.

It doesn't fucking matter

what it is. The point is,

don't be in a place

where you are not happy.

That is all.

This dude is my fucking spirit animal.

Holy shit.

Oh my god, I would totally pay to go to his

night just for shits and giggles.

If you are sick and tired

of your boss, your co-workers,

and your clients'

bullshit, then you need

to take a sick day.

Sick days are not only

for the flu. Sick days

are also for healing yourself

from bullshit.

You see, it's a great country.

It's a big country, but they don't have seat

at the courts.

And so they have a difficult

problem. There's another country that has

that same problem, by the way.

But when you look at what's happened with Europe,

many of those countries, they don't have those

problems, and they buy a lot of

oil and gas from Russia.

And as they know, I'm very disturbed by that

because we're helping them.

No, from that to this? We're going to get over this in a second.

I've got Colin still to do it.

That question could be really asked maybe more accurately

if you talked about many European countries,

not Hungary necessarily,

because Hungary is in a different

position, but many European

countries are buying oil and gas.

from Russia, and they have

been for years. And I say, what's that

all about, right? Thank you.

Yeah.

So that will be one of the issues for today

to explain clearly what would

be the consequences for the Hungarian

people and for the Hungarian economy

not to get oil and gas from

Russia because we are supplied by

pipe. You might start talking about

precious metals and materials. Let's see.

Because we don't have

exactly as the president explained

to you. So we will negotiate on

that point. It's vital for us.

Mr. Horvath, there are two pipelines,

as I understand. There's pipelines.

Two pipelines. The one in Russia

and the one I laid at your mom.

The pipeline from Croatia

can provide all of Hungary's

energy needs. As a result,

why would you need an exemption

if that's the case?

So when we discuss that issue, you should separate the

gas and the oil. On the

gas issue, which is very important for us.

Oh my God, I thought he said separate Gaza from

oil. I was like, oh shit.

Based on gas.

So we have only one

pipeline delivering

gas to Hungary, which is the main

pipeline, the Turkish

one. Yeah, I'm glad to see I'm

not the only one. Croatia is a very small

volume supplementary

gas pipeline. Okay, that's gas.

Oil is another issue. So oil is

coming from the Druzhba pipeline, which is the

main supply. And that is a

Croatian one, which is the

secondary

and supplementary pipeline. We would

like to

convince the Croatian government to enlarge it and

make it possible to deliver more. Under

the circumstances, it cannot be the main

pipeline. My wife would like the government to convince

them to enlarge it too. But later on, with some big

investments, it could serve better the interest of

Hungary.

Thank you.

Yes, please go ahead.

Thank you.

Many people

see this mission not

just as an encounter

between countries, but as

the symbol of the strengthening

of the new,

the new and the

new alliance.

And to your very

different interpretation, and how do you see this

mission off the road?

In the life of

people like

Viktor Orban,

stand up to

Brussels bureaucracy

and the global

agenda?

Are you from Hungary?

I figured.

The fact is that he's a great leader,

and he's respected all over.

Not necessarily liked by some of the leaders,

but you know, those leaders have proven to be

wrong.

If you look at his stance on immigration and

other things, you know, if you look at Europe,

they've made tremendous mistakes on immigration.

It's really hurting them very badly.

He has not made a mistake on immigration.

So he's respected by everybody.

He's liked by some.

And I can tell you, I like and respect.

I'm a double.

I like and respect him.

And that's the way Hungary is being led.

They're being led properly.

And that's why he's going to be very successful in

his upcoming election.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

May I have a comment on that?

Language is important, because the Anglo-Saxon

terminology is different from the European one.

So to use categories.

Oh, damn.

He went all the way back Anglo-Saxon.

I would like to be clear as much as we can.

We are the only government in Europe which

considers itself as a modern Christian government.

All the other governments in Europe are basically

liberal leftist governments.

So we try to do something from 2010 which is different,

from what the others are doing, even at the

philosophical level and the level of practice as well,

as just the President described it, like migration.

So we are kind of a special island of difference in a

liberal ocean in Europe.

And we consider ourselves as a modern Christian government.

Today I learned Hungary is an island.

That's the proper category to describe what we are doing.

To both of you, to both of you, to both of you, immigration.

We're talking.

But we'll repeat.

We'll report on that later.

Meetings with Putin.

We were talking about that with Victor.

He understands Putin and knows him very well.

And I feel that, I mean, I'm going to let you say what you

think, but I think that Victor feels we're going to

get that war ended in the not too distant future.

Victor, do you want to talk about that?

I'm strongly convinced.

So the question is whether we Westerners are unified or not.

The problem is that the President has huge peace

efforts.

I think the French and the Europeans have a very strong

relationship.

The French are just splendid and very positive for the

European continent and all the peoples of the, of Europe.

But at the same time we are not unified because Brussels and the

Europeans has a different approach to the war.

So the only pro peace government is the United States government

and the small Hungary in Europe anyway.

All the other governments prefer to continue the war.

Hungary and United States are the only peaceful governments in

the world.

I learned that today too.

On the front line.

Which is a misunderstanding of the situation.

So it's a complex problem.

the issue we will discuss it it's it requests not just two minutes to respond to your question but

not rather than our lecture sorry not to continue more than that to both of you to both of you so

you would say that ukraine cannot win that war you know miracle can happen yeah that's right

thank you president what is your message to the eu because i brought hungary and the

you okay what is your message well i think they should respect uh hungary and respect this leader

very very strongly because he's been right on immigration look what's happened to europe

with the immigration they have people flooding europe all over the place and it's hurting it it's

uh the crime rates are way up a lot of bad things are happening he his crime rates are very low

they're the same as they always were which is very little crime

uh because he's kept uh he's kept it the way it should be uh europe i mean i don't want to

go into individual countries they're all friends of mine everyone as you know in the uh in nato

they voted to go from two percent to five percent and you know that nobody thought that was possible

and we had just about almost other than spain a unanimous vote um no i think that uh i think they

respect him a lot they don't agree with him but actually inwardly i think they probably do agree

he he was right on immigration they were wrong they are flooding europe they gave him a booster

seat all over the world and europe is becoming a different place and i tell the leaders all the

time you better stop or you're not going to have europe anymore it's a very dangerous thing to do

why listen to this clown everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie because what he says affects

the economy so on migration for clarification in hungary the number of illegal migration is like

that zero zero because we have a

crystal clear system if somebody would like to come to hungary first he should ask for that if

you give the permission they can step in nobody can step on the territory of hungary without giving

having a permission from the hungarian authorities this is the regulation simple while working what

is the consequence of that we are under sanctions europe is hungary european union because we don't

let the illegal migrations to come to hungary and uh to the european union as well so we have to pay

inform you we have to pay every day one million euro as a punishment to the brazilian budget

because we stopped the migrants this is the absurd world we are living now in europe

yes thank you um i'd like to ask whether what do you think what do you believe um after this

meeting can you have maybe or the european european union will have another opinion about

just because of this penalty another opinion about hungary because of the immigration and

because all this kind of politics which is not that strictly as the european union direct what

do you believe yeah where are you from i'm from hungary okay uh i do have that conversation with

them and i i respect and like them you know they're all friends of that guy looks like he's

never had to deal with every single leader in europe is a friend of mine all right bro we get

along really well they've done everything i've asked them to do with nato etc the only thing they

need to do is buy oil from russia that's not too good but i told them they should respect this man

they can also learn from victor victor is at a very hard stance on more than anything else

immigration or even illegal immigration he literally has accepted no one over the years

think of how much greater these countries would be if they didn't have the tremendous crime that

has come in with the immigration people just

flowing in

into europe they've got to stop it and not only stop it they have to reverse it

they have to get them out we've done that here we have zero people coming in now the borders

are closed we take people but we take them legally but we've done it very strongly and we're moving

uh hundreds of thousands millions of people out we had uh of the 20 million people 25

million nobody knows even what the number is they they never knew biden had no idea

yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to put my pattern my in-laws into work right now because he wasn't

about open borders but we had open borders and we had millions of people come in and they were

coming in from jails they were coming in from mental institutions they were coming in as drug

dealers we had 11 888 murderers half of them committed more than one murder we're getting

them all out we're getting them out he doesn't have that problem but europe does have that problem

other parts of europe have that problem so uh you know i tell them all the

the time. I stick up for Viktor Orban. Not a lot of people do because in many cases they're jealous.

They wish they did what he did. Do you think it's ironic that there's an empty plate in front of

the guy from Hungary? No, I don't. And I have a bigger heart than anybody, but they've destroyed

some of those countries. Some of those countries had no crime 10 years ago and now they have quite

a bit of crime. And I would say that I don't know anything about your crime levels, but I would

imagine they're very low. Not too high, right? I'm Pookie. Did you use the channel points? I

didn't see. Just a clarification as well. I'm not here to ask President Trump to manage my

conflicts or our conflicts with the European Union. This is our matter. So we will do it.

What we need is a golden age to open a golden age of the United States, Hungary,

relationship. That's the biggest hub we can get from the United States. And maybe Europe, too.

You know, we can do it here. That guy, it's ironic the plate in front of him in Hungary is empty.

Yeah, we already heard that one. To be the most possible humble guy, yeah? But I'm the longest serving

Exactly. What we need is more money. I survived all the prime ministers who attacked us. And I'm sure

we will survive next years as well. So we will manage our conflicts successfully.

Mr. President.

One question for you, Mr. President.

One question for the prime minister. Speaking of Europe, last month you said that you would not withdraw U.S. troops from Europe.

Yet, a few weeks later, the Pentagon announced, decided to withdraw a significant number of troops from Romania.

So have you changed your mind or the Pentagon ignored your assurance?

No, they don't ignore anything that I say. What they do do is we make changes.

We move, it's the same number, total number, but we move people around. I happen to like the Romanian people.

I think they're great people. And, Pete, you may want to suggest something.

Romanian girls are bad.

Absolutely. No, nothing was uncoordinated with the White House. It's all part of the view that we have of Europe.

And there will remain troops in Romania, but there's some change in how we rotate and how many we rotate.

And the relationship with Romania is very good, right?

It's very good. And we've coordinated all this with Secretary General Ruta, with, throughout UConn,

throughout our allies, everyone was notified in advance.

The relationship with Romania is very good. The relationship with Europe is very good.

I disagree with what Europe is doing having to do with immigration, but I agree with them on many other subjects.

We just signed the biggest trade deal ever made with Europe, $950 billion.

We were able to do it because of tariffs. It was a deal that was good, very good, but we had a very unfair deal.

We were treated very badly before I came here.

But we just signed it. It's the single biggest trade deal ever signed.

So we have a very good relationship with Europe.

What is the main dispute with the Russians which prevents the Budapest summit with Putin from taking place?

The basic dispute is they just don't want to stop yet.

And I think they will. I think it's taken a big toll on Russia.

A big toll on both countries, obviously, but it's taken a big toll.

They're losing 7,000 soldiers a week. That's a big toll.

And between the two of them, divided, you know, with Russia losing more soldiers, actually.

But they're both losing a lot of people.

And that's the primary thing with me. It's not economic. It's not money.

In fact, we don't spend any money. We send it to NATO.

They pay us for our missiles and for our military and everything else.

It's not a question of money. It was with Biden.

He spent $350 billion.

There it is. Bingo.

The war would have never happened.

If I were president, the war would have never happened.

I think you would agree with that.

This war would never have happened if I were president.

It's stupid that it happened.

But it did happen.

I inherited the war.

And I think we're going to get it ended not too distant future.

Mr. President, no question that if that time the name of the United States president would have been Donald Trump,

there would be no war between Ukraine and Russia. That's clear.

But what we are speaking about here is more than that.

Because without the pressure coming from the United States government, I'm speaking 2022,

the Europeans would not take that hard line what they have today on the war.

Remember that big countries of Europe rejected to be involved more than just sending some humanitarian issues.

So the pressure coming from the United States to be more pro-war in Europe.

So that's the fact of the history anyway.

So we have to restore something which was ruined and created from here.

And that's the reason why I understand absolutely the devotion of the president now to do everything to stop the war.

I'll probably piss some people off with this, but I can't listen to this press conference because we got shit to do today.

And I have to go later to see my daughter's new school.

So unless something crazy happens, I'm going to pop off of this.

President.

Because that was an enormous mistake.

I'll keep it open in case.

But I got people calling in and writing in and I want to make sure that I do that.

But dude, we're having a decent day.

Chewy's having a really good day.

We took AAON this morning.

We're still going.

FI calls are doing well.

Kodak leaps that we've had for a month are going nuts right now at 30% today.

So we're doing okay.

But yeah, let me keep going.

Zillow's call-ins and write-ins and react-andy stuff.

So I got a write-in here.

Let's see what it says.

It says my girlfriend broke up like a month ago after six years.

Took me like two days to figure out why and it basically is undiagnosed ADHD.

I promised or said shit that I never followed through with.

Now I try my hardest to get my life together.

I saw how much the ADHD influenced my life in a very bad way.

How do you deal with yours?

Any advice?

I'd love to get her back.

I'm going to be real with you.

Is this something that she had brought to your attention for a long time?

And you just didn't pay attention to it?

Or did she drop this on you as she broke up with you?

Because if it's as she broke up with you, it's probably not the reason she broke up with you.

Okay?

That's number one.

Number two.

You're not going to fix your ADHD.

If it really is the fact that you have ADHD like like serious ADHD.

And she broke up with you because of it.

It's never going to work out.

I'm sorry.

It's just how it is.

It's somebody.

If somebody marries or is with somebody who has ADHD, you either can handle it or you can't.

There's no I'm breaking up with you because of this.

And if you fix what's wrong with you, I'll get back with you.

No.

She didn't even tell you she would get back with you if you fixed it.

You're putting it into your brain that this is the reason.

This is the only reason she broke up with me.

And if I can somehow change who I am, they might get back together with me.

Even if they did.

They would never be happy because clearly they can't handle being with you like this.

Number two.

Never fucking change yourself for somebody else.

You are who you are.

Be proud of who you are.

If that person doesn't want you for the way you are, they're not the right person for you.

I know you don't want to hear this after two days, but that's not how it is.

You're going to be you're going to be fighting to keep somebody who doesn't want you.

She told me that she loves me, but just can't imagine a future with me.

And I don't like who I was.

I'm only going to keep doing this because you know how I offer advice.

It's over, bro.

Okay, I had a girl.

My girlfriend in high school dumped me and she said I still love you.

I'm just not in love with you.

If she said I don't see a future with you, she doesn't see a future with you.

You're not going to change her mind.

Doing something to get somebody back who doesn't want a future with you is not is not is not how that works.

It's over.

It's over.

It doesn't it doesn't feel good.

Maybe down the line something else happens, but right now it's not that it.

If you don't like who you are.

Then take the time to work on yourself.

You can't be in a relationship and trying to work on yourself and especially trying to fix yourself while you're trying to make that person happy and think that it's going to work out.

You need to focus on you.

If there are things about your life you don't like then you need to take that time to fix that because if you don't fix that and you're with somebody then it's even more chaos because now you they got with you because of who you are.

But now you're changing into somebody else at the same time and then you fix the things you don't like.

The best you can but don't change who you are for somebody else because what happens if you change who you are?

You don't like who you are, but you're just happy that the other person likes you the version of you that there is there and then it doesn't work out again.

Now, you're no longer who you are.

You're unhappy and you're alone.

Just be yourself and you'll find somebody who wants you for you.

If you have toxic things about you or things you do that are bad habits or addictions or whatever like that work on that.

That's fine.

Do that.

You're a better person if it makes you a better person.

But don't change who you are.

You'll never be happy.

And you'll always be chasing a losing situation.

That girl or the next girl or whatever is going to not even like but be with you for somebody you hate.

And then they're not going to want to be with you because you're a fucking pity party, self-hating, self-deprecating, angry, sad person.

You're always going to lose in the end.

You're never going to win.

You're never going to win, bro.

So bypass all that bullshit and just work on being the best version of you.

Look in the mirror and say, you're all right, man.

Hey, I want to quit smoking.

I want to quit doing this.

This is this.

But you're fine the way you are.

People have a hard time believing that I'm married to a beautiful woman with an education that's not blind or deaf or quadriplegic or morbidly obese.

Or here as a refugee.

And I'm surprised, too.

But it's because I found somebody who likes me for me.

Okay?

You're going to spend years of your life that you don't get back, man.

You don't get those years back.

You don't get that time back.

And you're going to waste it.

And one day you're going to wake up and say, God damn it, I hate this.

I wish I would have fucking stopped this shit earlier.

Imagine how much more fulfilling this one life I get that is very fleeting could have been.

Imagine how much more fulfilling this one life I get that is very fleeting could have been.

Imagine how much more fulfilling this one life I get that is very fleeting could have been.

But you don't get to go back.

You don't get a redo, bro.

I'm sorry it didn't work out.

Okay?

I am.

But in the end, it might have been the best thing that happened to you.

Because imagine if it drug on for another two or three years.

And then she ended up cheating on you.

Or was unhappy.

And you're spending the whole time doing everything you can to try to keep them happy.

And you know they can't make it happy.

So you feel defeatist and everything like that.

Now you just wasted three more years of your life.

It's a bit more complex, but I see what you mean.

And your brain, it's like an addiction.

Your brain is going to do everything it can to convince you that you can make this work.

Maybe if I just do it a little less.

Or I try a different thing.

Or I just do it at this time and do that.

The situation is not complex.

Your brain is complex.

Your emotions, your chemicals is what's complex.

I don't expect you to just get over it right now.

It's going to take time.

Six years, bro.

That's a long fucking time.

Fuck it.

I'll see you at the gym, little bro.

Be proud of who you are, man.

If you're not proud of who you are,

then realize that you are the way you are.

And it's totally fine.

If there are things that you don't like that you do,

habits,

you can change those.

But you're not going to change who you are, man.

I don't want to go through life miserable.

You shouldn't either.

Hey, we should round up women against their will.

Tie them to fucking tables and breed them.

Against their will.

Out of context.

At least my spy calls are pumping.

See? There you go. That's a W today.

One day at a time, little bro.

Now take that money and go do something nice for yourself this weekend.

Go try something new.

Do something you've never done before.

Alright?

One day at a time, man.

I had my mic on in a meeting when you said that.

Okay, I didn't say that.

That's a repeat of something I said previously.

And I'll see you at the gym too, little bro.

I'm driving 700 kilometers in a week for a concert.

Okay, that's next week.

This weekend, I want you to go eat some ass.

Sorry, oh my god.

Next person.

UFC pick.

Oh, god.

Fuck, that's a tough one.

Guy on the left.

Guy on the right has weird tattoos.

He's also got that look where,

you know like when you go get a haircut

and you can't see it

and the barber does something

and then you look in the mirror and then you look back at it

and you're like, the fuck did you just do to me?

This guy on the left,

I don't know man, it's the eyebrows for me, bro.

It's the eyebrows.

This guy's from Jamaica.

Honestly, if he changed his nickname

right before the match and they announced him as

Gabriel the Hurricane Bonfim,

he'd probably, I'm sorry, that's probably too soon.

Yeah, go with the guy on the left.

Alright, what's next? No Collins today.

Let's see what we got.

Hi there, I talked to Tina about this,

one of your mods, and she told me to message you directly.

Is this server open to doing partnerships

with brands? Oh, no.

What is this? What is your business?

There you go.

I probably just missed out on another

sponsorship because I don't read my shit.

Okay, next one.

What else we got today? Let's see.

Oh fuck, I gotta go to my daughter's

new school. I love it, I love it.

Call me a centrist.

Oh, fucking pour hot wax on my fucking

nutsack, okay? Let it drip down my

gooch and call me a fucking centrist and I get

off on that shit, okay?

Grab some fucking tape

and fucking, fucking wax my gooch,

okay? I don't care if you, it gets me off

when somebody calls me a centrist.

Okay, back to headphones.

Stocky, I have an idea for a channel dancing emote.

What is it?

I accidentally liked it once.

Okay, no, we're not doing that.

No, I'm not gonna open

these up anymore. No, I have to open

them up on the other page and then click on it and drag it

so I probably hit the like button.

I didn't like that on purpose. I'm gonna use that for my

Twitch alerts? No. I'm about to go to my

daughter's, a tour of my

daughter's new Catholic school. Okay,

bro, can you guys chill a little bit?

They're gonna ask what I do for a living.

I always lie and say I work in finance.

It's kind of technically true, but not

like very, very technically.

My wife just sent me something. Uh-oh.

Oh my god, I thought it said I just received

$5,000 on PayPal. Oh my god.

Uh, it's a picture of an Indian woman

with a, uh, airplane

pillow around her neck and it says, when you're traveling without

your husband so you

actually have to use your brain, pay attention

be alert, take care of the passport, belongings

and carry your luggage yourself.

You know what's crazy? Remember how I told you

that they

they got off the plane and they had my

son, two and a half, and he's a menace

and my daughter, and there was three of them, right?

Two kids, three of them. Not watching.

My son pulls the fucking fire

alarm in the Philadelphia airport.

Yesterday we're driving and my wife goes

can I tell you something? And I go

yeah. She goes, I didn't know

those things existed. I said

what? She goes, the fire alarm.

What are you

talking about? She goes

I just, I just

I didn't know. I said who do you think

alerts people? She said I thought it was the fire department.

I said what if they're not there?

She goes they never taught us that. They just showed us in school how to

leave. It's too funny too yesterday

because yesterday her mom comes

to me and says the toaster doesn't work. I said what?

So I walked in there. It was unplugged. I was like okay.

They locked themselves out of the

room last night and I text the landlord

I'm like hey do you have a key for this? It's like 10 o'clock

and he doesn't answer it. So I look at it and I see

that the

doorknob is kind of

like the tumbler thing is kind of

like wide open. So I said let me try something.

They've been out of the room for two hours. Nobody told me.

I go. I grab a flat head screwdriver

turn it, pop it, boom open.

I'm like can you keep drawing a line on

spy? No. I told you what I thought at the time.

I got lucky. I don't know how

we timed the exact bottom

of a multi-trillion dollar

S&P 500 bottom but

we get lucky sometimes.

Alright. Stocky recently

you had talked about how men don't really

grow up. They just get more expensive toys.

I found this video and thought it was a perfect example.

Okay. What is it?

This is like somebody getting a fucking tractor. Like a

kid's tractor to a bigger tractor.

Three phases of life.

That would have been cool to play Mario Kart on.

Okay. That's a bit

excessive.

Wait. What the fuck?

Either that guy is not married

or he is married and his wife

hates him and is just glad that he's in his own little

room. Listen. I'm not

hating on it. Okay. Alright.

Obviously he went with F1

because it's easier than NASCAR so

I get it. But

the crazy thing is like

it's cool. Don't get me wrong. Like if I had a hobby

I'd love to be able to do that shit.

Okay. I'd love to be able to do that shit.

Um. But

it's true. It is true. I've said it before

I'll say it again. Men, we don't grow up.

We just get more expensive toys.

It's true.

Men are such simple creatures.

Women have this figured out guys. They

know this shit. They're born with it. They know

we are simple fucking creatures.

Okay. We are so

fucking easy to manipulate

to control

and I'm not even

upset about it. Like that's just

who we are. That's just who

we are. Okay.

We are dumb and we are

easy to control

and manipulate. And I'm admitting that.

And if you say it's not true, you're full of shit.

You're just mad that you don't have a woman doing

that to you. There are different levels of it.

But that's just how it is.

If my stomach is full and my

sack is empty and

I'm relaxing, bro there's nothing

that could...

You've tamed me. You have tamed

me. You have domesticated me.

I don't care how fucking crazy I was

down in the... I know that that sounds

a little bit, you know,

you know, someone else who's misogynistic.

No, it's the truth. We are

so easy to manipulate.

My wife will wear something,

you know, a little bit risqué

and come down and say something like, ooh

that couch looks really good. Maybe we should...

Where's my food, bitch? No, no.

This floor's dirty. Why are the kids not

in bed? My stomach's empty

and my sack's full. Who the fuck...

Not a good time. But like

she'll do that and she'll be like,

man, we should really maybe break the couch

down in front of that mirror later tonight.

And I'm like... And she

has me wrapped around her finger. I will do anything she

asks because I think that some nasty

crazy shit's gonna happen. And then

it'll be, ugh, the kids took forever to go to bed.

I know, we gotta get

some sleep though, but we'll do it tomorrow.

And my dumb lizard brain will believe

that shit. My dumb

lizard brain will believe that shit.

And the cycle fucking

continues. Until it gets

to a point where my sexual

frustration gets so much and she starts

noticing that. She's like, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Better let some steam out of the teapot

over here.

And the cycle goes again.

We are simple creatures.

We are such simple

creatures. It's insane.

It's insane. Get it first and then do something.

No, my wife knows that once I get PNC,

it's over. Nothing's getting done.

Like, I have no motivation.

And women know this.

They're born with it.

I'm not even mad. I congratulate

you ladies. But yes,

that's men for you. Try having

sex with your wife while taking care of a newborn.

Okay, that's kinda weird. What's PNC?

Post-naught clarity. I think you wrote

that wrong and let me tell you something

right now. My daughter

has no idea how many times she was

on one end of the bed while mommy was getting

fucking railed. Okay?

You make it work how you make it work.

Oh. Oh.

Because I said it out loud.

Every single one of you that are parents

that had a small kid,

you know that if you have a large king-size bed,

you put the kid to bed, you put him down at the

foot of the bed, wrap him up in their little air,

or put them in their bassinet at the end of the bed,

and you and mommy get down. Or you and daddy get down.

You gotta get down when you can because you can't be out of the room

because the baby wakes up. You gotta get up.

You don't think that there's been a time where I was

mid-stroke and I heard a baby crying and I'm like, fuck.

That shit happens. That's real life.

That's real life.

It ain't nothing more frustrating. And once the kid

baby's crying and mommy's gotta get up to

go do the feeding and stuff like that, it's over

for you, bro. It's over for you.

That's just real life.

You may think it's inappropriate to talk about, but

I'm telling you right now, that's how it's gonna go, guys.

What's the play in the situation?

Do you finish off the job?

You're going to, but

you're gonna convince yourself that maybe

there's a chance that, no, it's game over, bro.

Thanks for that draw on that line, Stocky.

Check Trader General chat.

It's Friday. We get stupid on Fridays.

I got a MILF in my DMs now.

What does she want? I'm kidding.

I have no idea what you look like.

It's funny that you get older.

A MILF is just

a lady your age with kids now.

Okay, that's just really weird.

Why would I check Trader General?

What is this? What the fuck?

When did I do that? The other one?

That one I can't pull up on stream, and you know that.

You actually know that. You're my mod.

You really should not

attempt to get me actually banned.

Like, that's just weird that you would do that.

That's not even like...

Like, there's like a line, Tina,

where it's like, hey, this is something that's funny

versus, hey, I could get my streamer banned.

Like, just a little lower on that one.

Do you think it will go

to day high? Well, what go to day high?

Can this be the 4.5

year badge? You want me to make this into a

badge? Daniela, get on it. Make it into an

emote.

Thoughts on DraftKings? It looks very oversold.

DraftKings is

interesting.

Um,

but there's so much competition. I think

DraftKings might be in play with Disney

right now, but Disney's having a hard time with their

ESPN bet, man. They're renaming it and everything.

Stocky, it's been a while since we've done a good

conspiracy whiteboard. I have to

get off stream, but I could think of one.

How about this?

Y'all remember on New Year's

2024, when

one of the largest police responses

in history happened

at a mall in Miami?

And later on, the police said it was

just some teenagers fighting,

but the eyewitnesses said

they saw like 7 to 10 foot

tall creatures, and then it just

went away. Like, whatever happened

to that? So there's a large

disturbance caused by teenagers. Setting off fireworks

was a significant police response.

Look at how many police were there for some

teenagers fighting.

Good look at your screen.

Look at that. Good look at your screen.

See that thing? All the

police right there? What is that? What is that thing?

Marketplace

on New Year's Day. Take a good

look at your screen. Are those

aliens walking in front of

Marketplace in downtown Miami?

Online conspiracy

theorists are saying that shadowy

figure, not far from

parked Miami police cars, appears

to be an alien. Uh, honestly,

I think it looks pretty real to me. Uh, aliens

look pretty chill. They look pretty chill.

Them aliens look pretty chill. But look at

the amount of people, look at the amount of cops.

Police presence at Bayside on New Year's Day.

Crowds of young people armed with

sticks began fighting.

I'm not saying it was aliens

in any way, but it's just funny

because teenagers with

sticks, but the amount

of cops was insane.

Like, where's the other one here?

There's gotta be one over here.

Let me see. Oh yeah, look at

this. Look at the amount of

cops. Three different

police departments. Police from

one end of the street all the way

up. Motherfucking

bank robberies don't have this many cops.

OJ didn't have this many cops.

Okay? It's

insane. Bayside Marketplace.

Three agencies.

I don't believe this is real because you wouldn't hear their

sirens from that far up. But

the actual video was wild.

Now, do I think there were aliens?

No, I don't think there was like fucking aliens.

But everything got scrubbed.

And the police never gave a good answer

and then it just disappeared. If you want

a real conspiracy that's not a theory,

remind me on Monday

to talk about Operation Hemisphere

and how AT&T got caught

collecting every

single person's phone records.

Recording them, collecting them, everything, metadata

on them, and giving it to the

government and local law enforcement.

And still doing it to this day.

Yep. They collect

it and they say, we're collecting it, we're only giving it

to law enforcement. And not only that,

law enforcement doesn't have to get

a subpoena or a warrant.

I'll wait till Monday.

Isn't that the Patriot Act? Oh, it's been

happening way before the Patriot Act. Oh,

no, no, no, no, no. This is

old news. Just because it's old news

for you doesn't mean

it's not

something else. Good call on the reversal

of luck. I got lucky.

Interesting enough, somebody learned today

when I told them that women don't

men aren't missing one

rib. We don't have one less rib than women.

A lot of people were taught that as kids, especially people who went to religious

things. And somebody was like, holy shit,

I actually learned that today. You'd be surprised what people don't know.

It's not that they're dumb or something like that, it's just they don't

know. It's something that they're told and they never look

to, you know, you believe your parents, you believe

your pastor or whatever, and

you just go with it. You never

think to look and see if it's not true or not.

Yes, look. Guys,

we're not missing a rib. Why

would we be missing a rib? Well, because

in the Bible, it says

that God created man

with Adam, and then when he was sleeping, took one of

his ribs and made Eve, right?

The woman. And as you're

growing up, they want to convince you that the story

is very, very true, and they say

to this day, that's why men

have one

less rib than women. And you just kind

of go through and be like, oh, that's

what it is? Oh, like, oh, oh, okay, it's

you know, whether it's true or not, but

you think, okay, men have, women have one more

rib than men. You don't verify it, you know what I mean?

You never go like, oh, fuck, let me

go verify this shit. It's just

in the back of your head. And when you do see a skeleton on Halloween,

you never go, huh, let me go count this. You're just

like, oh, it's a skeleton. They make them symmetrical,

you know? And until

you lay down a

woman, a female and a male skeleton

in your basement and compare them side

by side, you know, you

can tell yourself that it's this, you know,

they have the same number. Now, the anatomy's different

and the size and the shape is different, but that's it.

Alright, who are we rating today, guys? I gotta

go, I tried to make it a degen Friday today

because we haven't really been degen for a while.

Um, so hopefully I got a little bit crazy

and degen for you. We had some fun.

Uh, sorry that it's a little bit more informative.

To my one guy who said that my

show has become unwatchable, I don't know what to tell you.

I'm having fun. If you're not, I'm

sorry, but I'm not gonna change. I think we're

doing a great job. I think the show is awesome

now. I think doing stocks,

doing trades, talking about them, doing

market, doing economics, doing

memes, doing fucking shit. I'm having a good

time. I'm having a good time. If you're not,

I mean, there's other places to go.

No Zillows? Uh, nobody sent me any Zillows.

It's the same amount of

unwatchable? Okay. Um,

who was it that said they had somebody

for me to raid? Um,

Poopy? I'm sorry,

Pookie. Are you still here?

Raid these nuts? Okay, thank you.

No, oh, did you send one? You must

have sent it late, Sarah.

Oh, uh, I just

got a bot. Reminder.

What was the message?

Um, 30 days ago,

uh,

someone said, fuck Rivian,

maybe I'll add to my AEHR.

And I said, remind

me in 30 days.

And I just got my reminder.

So, Rivian,

30 days ago. That's great.

He asked me what to buy. I said, you should

get Rivian. He said,

he said, um, fuck Rivian,

maybe I'll add

AEHR calls yesterday and wait for it to gap.

And I said, uh,

bad take, remind me 30 days.

Let's see how AEHR did

in the same time frame.

God damn! Oh!

Oh no! I love my little

remind me bot. Alright, Poopy,

did you still have the person you want me to raid after

the stream? Or did they leave?

I guess they left. Alright,

who are we raiding, guys? I gotta go, I gotta go not get my

uh, daughter kicked out of, uh, Catholic school

before she starts. Great stream

today, Stocky. Don't tell that to the, to,

um, Matrix.

Do you think Dpro will come back? Yes.

No, they unfollowed me!

Fight, Bluehens, fight. I should go to

Univ- oh, I think I'm gonna go to the, the Renaissance

Fair this weekend, if any of you guys are gonna be there.

Raid Jew-

Joy- Joyto? You can't

make everybody happy, guys.

It is what it is. The show is what it is.

I'm having a good time. It is what it is.

I'm never gonna make everybody happy.

Uh, this is my front page on Twitch. I'm getting off right now!

I'm getting off right now! Nice.

Oh, I thought we were leaving. We gotta go to her school.

Is that Sfan? Something like that.

Is this my ramen noodles I made last night?

I need to clean this up. I'm going to. I'm gonna put a tarp

down. I'll spend 10, 20 minutes doing

something else. Oh, yeah, today.

Remember what I told you?

Remember what I told you?

Hey, it's Pookie. His tag is TyingLegend.

Reheated Ramen,

you're wild, man. Bro, calories

are calories, man. What's good?

Legend. Me, a legend?

His tag is

Tying...

TyingEnds underscore new.

Tarp that room up, baby.

I'll see you soon.

And your lizard brain believed it. I know!

Okay, um...

Do I have permission to raid this person?

Fuck it, whatever.

My wife still has no idea that I switched

out our wedding picture for Peyton Manning.

Yes, baby doll!

We're getting late? Oh, okay, I'm

coming. Alright, let's get out of here and get

naked. You don't have to ask

someone's friend for consent if the friend

invited you to join. Alright, let's go.

Alright, guys, remember, become

an organ donor. It's the greatest gift you can give. It doesn't

cost you a thing. That's number one. Number two, if there's somebody you love,

assuming you haven't talked to in a while, give them a call.

Give them a text. Send them an email. Send them a carrier pigeon.

Let them know you're thinking about them.

You can really make somebody's day. But more

importantly, go make your own day.

You got the rest of it. Make the best of it.

And remember, as long as you got two healthy

kidneys, you are not broke. Otherwise,

I will see you guys tomorrow. Hasta mañana.

Oh, no, sorry, on Monday. Hasta lunes.

Hasta luego. Mi amigos, mi familia, cabrones,

pentejos y todo. Gracias por todo.

To my lurkers, I know you're out there. You are the backbone

of this channel. Thank you so much for being here each and every day.

And to everybody who gifted stuff, donated gay bits,

followed whatever. You're absolutely crazy simps.

I don't know why you do it, but I appreciate you.

And I don't know what.

Thank you. And to

every single one of you. Thank you for letting me keep you company

each and every day, doing whatever it is you're doing.

And letting me do this

as a job. I don't know why you show up,

but as long as you keep coming,

I'ma keep coming too, baby. I'll see you

guys on Monday. Go fuck

yourselves. Tell your mom I said hi. She got a fat ass.

And as always,

stay green, you DJs.

The French are horrible.

I'll see you at the Ren Faire.

Ren Faire. If you guys are going to the Ren Faire in Delaware

this weekend, DM me.

DM me. I'll see you there.
