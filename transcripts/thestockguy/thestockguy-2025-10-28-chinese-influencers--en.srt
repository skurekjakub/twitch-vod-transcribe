service but thank you for nothing damn rmbs starting to move a little bit i'm gonna have to do this

welcome to the e-commerce world i'm out of the woods welcome to the e-commerce world i'm out of the worlds

thanks for the we ride signal not a signal service but thank you for nothing damn rmbs starting to move a

little bit i think that'll come back a little bit uh maybe i'll go for it next week i'll do a little trick with the

damn rmbs starting to move a little bit thanks to gpus signal not a signal service but thank you

for whatever all right guys let's go ding ding ding wait what oh there it is all right so good

morning ladies and gentlemen uh boys girls dj's alike hope you guys are good this morning we got

a lot of shit to go over um and uh obviously we've got uh china news we got everything else

all right time to grab some more jet blue here car is uh is uh my main play today um commercial

hvax outweighing uh residential losses and a five billion dollar buyback so i'm definitely

doing that let me grab a little bit more jet blue here i only legged in we'll see if it plays out

or if we if we get a sell-off today we don't know but rmbs is flying that's a good one that we

picked up this morning uh ee a nice little pop out the gate and paypal not really uh holding

on to the gains yet um so we're gonna do that so i'm gonna grab a little bit more jet blue here

and then um we'll see we'll get out of rumbus as well uh six percent on this actually i'm gonna go

ahead

put a two percent oh oh oh whoa whoa two percent on that one all right so we've got um what do we

got moving right now our moh calls up 20 near starting to move we got earnings after hours

you you called from yesterday looking kind of good too were you still in vc no vc was the one

that we took on thursday for the um uh for the damn rim is still going uh thanks for the paypal

signal yesterday stocky it wasn't a signal also i was expecting these contracts to go

back to open up 400 this morning and they're only up 100 right now because it gave it all back

but we're not there yet all right uh rmbs stopped out of nice gain on that one um we're gonna see

how jet blue plays out i'm down a couple percent on it right now i i have a feeling it's a yolo so

i'm playing a very big kilo right now uh divvy's giving it back this morning which makes sense oh

d pro is back under nine okay now i know what to do all right i'm gonna jump into d pro here

or legging i'm gonna jump into d pro here okay now i know what to do all right i'm gonna jump into

it again i should say we got out you're a big yolo guy i'm sorry to hear that or i'm happy for

you all right rmbs still going if anybody's still in that one spy gave some back there so we got to

be uh be very uh uh watchful on that keep an eye on nuclear today as well big nuclear um news with

the uh with the government as always uh but uh again uh did you get shares or calls or shares

for uh jet blue i've got shares right now um i put a uh a a buy for

calls too if it falls a little bit more they're super ridiculously cheap and i think it makes

sense because i don't think anybody uh the thing with uh jet blue is is they said that um they they

tightened up uh you know their their guy their their well they they missed a little bit on their

earnings however what they did have was a expectation of a holiday travel season being

better than expected but there's a lot of concerns with the atc and their loss was a little bit less

um and so i'm just legging in right now um if this falls under four bucks then i might just let it go

but i want to see if there's a bounce back

on here now international uh and and uh flights that have like first class and whatnot are

killing it because they have the ability for upgrades uh and in-flight purchases uh but uh

again with something like jet blue uh we'll see we'll see uh a lot of a lot of headwinds with it

right now especially with the atc stuff going on but i think that there's a bounce back opportunity

here i could be wrong um so that's why i legged in and i'm still legging in um but uh but yeah uh

you know obviously we got to keep a is d pro a long-term position for you i mean we've been in

d-pro um and we bought it uh and we made a lot of money the first time we got into d-pro uh was um

was here and then it was off of the uh the russia ukraine drone thing and it went crazy we sold it

the next day they did an offering fell 50 we got into it again sold it uh scalped it a few times

bought sold on the way up bought sold and now um i'm going back into it because we sold uh yesterday

when it went over uh when it went over 10 bucks um and then it kept going but got out so i'm going

back in again uh this i just like to um uh i'm going to go back into it and i'm going to go back

i like to uh to trade up and down because uh it's not going anywhere um drones aren't going

anywhere and so um i'm not uh i'm not too concerned about that right now i mean i could be wrong again

but uh i'm really not i'm just not too concerned about it at the moment uh and so okay i just sold

one of my paypal calls i'm probably going to regret this um i sold it for 110 percent uh the

other one i'm going to hold and see what happens four months thoughts on putting up christmas

decor the day after halloween um you know what's funny i'm going to be honest with you i used to be

um i used to be i used to be a big uh uh grinch when it came to putting up how uh christmas

decorations early but you know what i'm getting as i've gotten early or i've gotten older i don't

give a fuck if it makes you happy do it jesus christ i i'm just as guilty as everybody else

why the fuck do i care so goddamn much about other people's actions if it makes them happy

i i feel like i i feel like as we get older we're just we have to we mature and we get older and

it's like if that it's stupid but if it makes somebody happy and it doesn't hurt anybody

fucking go for it man do it do it okay do it now don't be that guy when we first moved into this

um when we first moved into this neighborhood uh we had a the the the um jesus christ this is

still going uh we had a the people across from us always won the uh the neighborhood um

decoration contest because they went all out like it was just like front facing it was insane

up and down they had like it would look like a goddamn gingerbread house and i was like man of

course it's the guy across the street from me but i didn't really care but then when i had kids

they moved but when i had kids i was like you know what i don't really care but but but i was like

all right i gotta i gotta step it up a little bit right so i stepped it up a little bit and i had

the best looking house on the block but then so then our neighbor two doors down had kids at the

same time as us and then the next year they upped their game a little bit so i was like fuck so the

next year i had to up my game a little bit and then the the neighbors down the street you know

a few houses on the other side started up in their game and at one point i was like all right this is

gonna bankrupt me because i'm about to like have to like go through this competition so then i just

decided you know what i'm not even gonna decorate the whole house anymore i'm just gonna do a big

like thing at the front of the yard near the near the the street and that's enough for me that's

enough for me kids loved it it's great and it's more fun to look at everybody else's house than

your own they're not in competition yet now when they're teenagers maybe we're moving whatever

but let me tell you something let me tell y'all

something this is a little secret now i i i know that i'm not supposed to tell y'all to spend your

money on shit okay i know that okay that's that's like i'm supposed to tell y'all save every dime

and do everything by hand and fucking sew your own clothes and fucking eat rice and beans and

shit nah fuck that let me tell you something right now let me tell you something right now

i'm gonna give y'all a little fucking thing that's gonna help y'all out remember we say sometimes

that that that the roi and your time and your effort and everything like that sometimes it's

better to spend a little bit more to give more back in your life there's a service out there

they will come and decorate your fucking house for you they will bring all of the lights all of

the fucking whatever you need they will set it all up for you go up on the roof do everything for you

put it up there and then come take it all down for you and you might say yourself yeah stocky

that's gonna cost me 650 bucks or 750 bucks it's gonna cost you more than that or close to it on

the decorations you have to get on the fucking roof you have to put all that shit together

then you have to go up and take it all down then you have to store it all you

take it out the next year half of it's broken you have to spend money to replace it and

it's all tangled up and you have to spend three hours fucking untangling it if you've got money

then do this okay i'm just saying i'm just saying you don't even have to have a ton of money

okay all right 200 to 2500 depending on how big your house is and stuff like that

usually middle is between five and six hundred bucks i know that it's it's a stupid purchase

but let me tell you something the fact that you don't have to deal with all that shit sometimes

worth the money now i'm not talking to better talking about people who who um who who are like

literally on a budget but i'm talking about those of you guys who have disposable income

but you just don't want to store all that shit and unwind it and then worry about the bulbs and

then get on the roof and fucking break your back and then put it up and then take it all down and

then and then the worst part is is nothing quite like going on the roof stapling everything after

five hours getting it going down turning it on and realizing you fucked up okay nah

forget all that i'm just saying like you know to those who have it now for those of you guys who

are looking for a side hustle those are the kind of things let me tell you about a little side hustle

right now halloween decorating front porch halloween decorating that's a legit neighborhood

business that that that people put together i'm not even kidding you people will pay you

for the supplies and a couple hundred bucks to go fucking decorate their front porch

jack-o'-lanterns and and and whatever they you don't even have to do anything like

they'll literally have you give you the money to go buy the stuff you need and then you put it up

in their front yard in their in their in their um in their porch it's weird people people with money

have more money than ever and they're spending it and if you think i'm wrong let me tell you

something right now you do it for extra income see i'm not even i'm not even doing that i'm not

even joking um it it it's it's wild there there is opportunities out there and this is why i'm

saying this consumer spending is expected to go up this year now i put out a tweet yesterday about

what's going on in the stock market right so we talked about this yesterday i'll put it's in

stocky's daily news as everything is um and it's funny how i can talk about some bullshit christmas

light story and turn it into an economic talk um gpus is up 28 what the fuck i'm sorry that you

missed it so let me show you this and i got into a little argument on twitter with somebody over

this but i think we came to a conclusion or an agreement thanks for selling rmbs what thank you

christmas merry christmas merry christmas kiss my ass kiss his ass kiss your ass happy hanukkah

listen i made good money on it all right fuck you um all right so so here you go let me show

you guys a little chart stocks and perception of the economy disconnected right so basically

for those of you guys who are new to the markets and new to this kind of stuff i don't know why i

love charts so much but uh it it's just like it's like how they i like how they look they just look

nice but um yeah so basically this blue line is the

s&p 500 okay this is what the market looks like and then the consumer confidence or the consumer

sentiment survey consumer sentiment is what the average person thinks of the economy right like

if they're going to have a job if they're going to be able to afford things how they have their

confidence as a consumer if they're going to be able to pay their bills if they're going to have

extra money to spend and so generally consumer confidence goes up and down um you know with with

different like you know fears in the world whether it's like an election or it's like uh uh you know

it's about you know just it's the headlines or whatever it is but there comes a point where

you you're you know you kind of get an equal weight from people in the bottom 50 percent of

people in the top 50 percent right and so that's kind of the thing that you see here well for the

first time since co since it's been keeping the records it's completely inversed right in the

beginning consumer confidence was high in the 1960s but the market was relatively new right

and so we were coming out of the baby boom era the 1950s the economy was exploding people you

post post-world war ii everybody had jobs we were rebuilding the world and it kind of stayed with

it but covid has changed that and the reason that you see this is is that consumer confidence is

down at 50 but the market's at all-time high why because we're actually getting a k shape

and the reason is is that the top 40 of earners make up 60 of consumer spending so you have less

people earning and spending more money and you have more people earning and spending less so

it starts to it starts to make a big a

big difference so the people that are doing well are doing better than ever and more people are

doing better than ever but the people who are doing worse are doing far worse than they were

so they you know and you get 60 percent of people that are in that right range versus the 40 percent

and if they're doing worse than they ever have it's going to show that divergent and as you can

see that's a literal k right there okay you see that that's a literal k you're literally seeing

the split here where the market is going but consumer confidence is going down now that will

change a little bit because more people are doing better and more people are doing worse

people than ever are involved that's in the stock market 62% now versus 45% pre-COVID but even the

people that are now are just new to the market and they're just doing 401k dollar cost averaging

they don't pay attention to it as a asset to borrow against or as confidence of something

they can use for retirement quite yet so that's kind of one of the things that you'll see there

now all right either way um but yeah so so that's what we're seeing now why was I talking about this

I was gonna I was bringing this up with something um what was oh fuck I I I ADHD'd out what was it

um love this community thank you for existing stocky your name is golden retriever fuck I

appreciate you but man that was not what I needed here right now we got to leave at 11 30 a.m

to um or 11 or we have to be at 11 40 we have to leave to take Bayo to the cancer specialist today

um and so yeah so so so there's a lot of side hustles out there right now that are are are

making money and they're making money and they're making money and they're making money

making money and they're making money and they're making money and they're making money and they're making

money because people with money have more money and they're willing to spend that money

right because what did I tell you the one thing that rich people can buy that poor people can't

buy and I don't mean like a yacht or some shit the one thing they can afford that poor people

just can't afford is time buying time it's the most important precious thing in the world

god damn it of course um it's the most important precious thing in the world and it's the one thing

that people with money can buy that people that can't migrate my example that I always use is

is that if you

need to mow your grass and you don't if you're a guy just want your dad or mom and you just want

to get the fuck away from the family and the kids for a while you do it but you're gonna have to go

mow it's an hour of your day but if you have money you can hire somebody to do it for you

right and so you get that hour of the time now most likely that hour of time you're just going

to waste on some stupid shit but you still buy that time that you don't have to to to utilize

elsewhere and so in America the best way to make money is to give is to save people time or make

people lazier well

sorry things more convenient and that's the kind of thing that is is making money right now there

are side hustles that are popping up everywhere where you can find a niche that needs to get filled

that that can take and take care of it and with people having more the people with money to spend

have more money than ever and they can buy time they will do that I'm telling you I told you guys

this two years ago on Halloween Halloween decorating in your neighborhood you know it

sounds embarrassing but if you go around and say hey um you know Halloween's coming up and I know

a lot of people want to uh you know uh you know put up decorations and you know you know you know

decorations stuff but there's a lot of you know a lot of not a lot of time and everything like this

and everybody's so busy right now I'm offering a service right now um you tell me what you want

how you want it here's some examples of what I've done uh I'll go get the supplies I'll you know I'll

even carve the pumpkins for you uh if you want I'll set up the the the fall leaves whatever you

want you let me know I'll take care of it for you it costs you know a hundred dollars an hour

whatever you want and people are like actually that sounds really cool if I had that kind of

disposable income I would pay somebody to do it for me too okay now personally you know our house

looks like the fucking section eight house on the internet I don't know I don't know I don't know

on the on the block because we're like we spend the less least amount of money on shit but you

know we have our large huh it's 185 bucks for the consultation today oh I don't remember yeah

there's a pay for the screening for him if you want to put yourself on the lease yeah you have

to pay for the screening it's called being frugal we make more money than you know I mean we're not

fucking you know billionaires but we we do better than anybody in our neighborhood we just don't

up a hundred percent at one point uh you you we took calls yesterday those are looking really

good um I have a few things moving fuck why do I have all this shit I sold all this shit yesterday

that's the problem is that when you when you put uh post market sales and you get busy around eight

and they don't hit you got to go back and manually do it made money on vc I need yellow money to lose

somebody um the funny thing about vc is is we played that thursday into friday and um and we

played it the morning call on thursday we talked about them because they had the uh they paid down

their debt from their SPAC related debt we played that thursday into friday and um and we played it

thought that that would be a catalyst for them and i think i sold it for like four percent on

friday and this morning some of the guys one of the guys in discord showed me he was still holding

it from thursday morning and he was up 271 and this shit actually went all the way to four dollars

it went 600 this morning so oh we got some news on something a little reversal on the market

now i i i can't tell this person congratulations because it's like why the fuck did you hold

although that wasn't really a day trade for a lot of people because it wasn't like a yolo it was

more of a this is actually a company paying down debt and everybody loves a company paying down

debt right now but this is just wild right here they got the u.s department of health and human

services uh contract this morning like that that's not why they went you want to go ahead and sell

that last paypal call so it moons more you're toxic i agree with that guy earlier thanks for

the wolf signal in the morning call it's not a fucking signal service and all i did was tell you

did we did was that the bottom on

sofi was that the bottom right there was that really the bottom um no so what happened with um

what was i just talking about how do you combat insider trading i don't inside trade how do i

combat it you don't the market's rigged in your favor oh tara wolf so during a call this morning

we talked about tara wolf um they decided to come out and just uh quietly uh give a little hint to

their earnings coming up and they came out and said that they're expecting revenue for the third

quarter of 2020 and they're expecting an 84 year-over-year increase in revenue okay and then

they also snuck in there that they're expecting because their earnings haven't hit yet they're

expecting an adjusted ebita of between 15 million 19 million they had 6 million third quarter of

2024 so between 150 and 200 percent increase in adjusted ebita that's all i said is i gave you

the news i didn't fucking tell you to buy it thanks for so if i'm at 10 of my weeklies why

are you guys all in fucking weeklies all the time not everything has to be an option if it is it

fucking uh weekly you're taking those jet blue calls i'm down on my jet blue calls already

but i just got in them why did we buy you you you you calls yesterday what do you mean why did

we what do you mean why did this i weep for your soul the reason i got into you you you you calls

yesterday was i said that while the trade deal with china or at least the potential trade deal

with china is causing rare earth metals to collapse yesterday

uranium is different because uranium and well you you you is the is the number one facility for

for for processing and and enriching you know you know you know or i should just say you know

processing rare earth metals in the u.s so if there is a china trade deal that or if china

does uh block or curb exports on on rare earth the processing facility for you you is the best one

but they are uranium first so while everyone's selling this off for rare earth uranium and

nuclear isn't going anywhere and you're not going to be able to sell this off for rare earth

so that's why we got it the reason it's popping today is because the because of what we talked

about this morning the government um has uh has struck a deal with um ccj bam and wab on an 80

billion dollar partnership uh to build nuclear reactors across united states sofi green thanks

stocky thanks for the sofi signal w signal on sofi this is not a fucking signal service you

dipshits you better get out before the fucking thing collapses on you again bitch how often should

you refinance your mortgage 6.37 currently worth uh it at six percent um i'm not a i'm not a big fan

of refinancing um unless it's like within a year um because here's the thing if you refinance down

only 0.37 percent and you've had that for a year or two you're gonna lose all the interest you've

paid which is which is 95 of every payment you made went straight to interest you get none of

that back so if your house is five hundred thousand dollars you're gonna

lose forty thirty forty thousand dollars per year that you've had it in interest that does

not carry over people forget this i have videos on it uh people forget that it doesn't carry over

to the new term so sixty thousand dollars twelve percent of your entire house's value you've paid

you get nothing it's just gone thanks thanks for playing you keep that much equity then when you

refinance you also play pay closing costs each time so in my opinion unless you're within the

next five years you're gonna be able to pay that interest regardless but it just doesn't it doesn't

it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's worth it because here's the thing if you're willing to

do it at 6.37 to 6 then you're probably going to want to do it when it goes from 6.37 down to 5.85

or whatever now if you strongly believe that interest rates are going to go back up then

maybe it makes sense i don't see that happening right now just because i don't think it's going to

the the the 10-year i mean could easily but the the fed the fed is cutting rates we know they're

cutting rates are cutting at least two more times this year then on top of that the 10-year treasury

is finally kind of cooling off a little bit so the two biggest factors in your 30-year fixed

mortgage is the is the is the federal funds rate and the 10-year treasury and both of those are

coming down right now so you know now that could change in any minute because our economy is

fucking weird but but but you know i i would be more in the in the in the docket of is is here's

what i would do instead of refinancing it taking that fourteen thousand dollars in closing costs

here's what i would do i would take that fourteen thousand dollars that you're going to pay in

closing costs and just throw it at the principal of your current mortgage that way if you're if

it doesn't go down you've paid so much down the principal that you're not paying that that that

that interest on that fourteen thousand which is going to offset a lot of that that that interest

you were going to refinance down for anyways and if rates do come down later on you can then

refinance and make it worth it or at least you've paid down the principal and you're not paying

interest on that fourteen thousand

which fucking compounds a lot over time.

We ride moving?

Well, we had news this morning,

for those of you guys that were going to call.

Uber said they are going to invest

in WeRide and Pony's Hong Kong IPOs.

Okay, my last PayPal call

that we took through earnings

is at 150%.

I am going to regret this immensely.

But I am a man of the people.

How many shares of WeRide do you own?

Right now, I only have my original 100,

but I've traded it like 30 times.

All right, we took this through earnings last night.

Now, the question is,

do I be a responsible guy

and take this money, withdraw it,

and use it to pay my bills?

Or do I fucking parlay it

and just fucking double it up

and go into Visa calls through earnings?

I mean, I own Visa shares.

I'm kidding, guys.

I'm not fucking asking chat for advice.

I own Visa shares, so I'm okay with that.

The only concern I have for Visa through earnings

is the buy now.

Pay later.

And the, you know,

all the fucking new stablecoin transaction shit

that's going on that they're not a part of

could really hurt them.

Have you heard about the buy now,

pay later on slot machines?

Remember, there was something talking about that last year.

Casinos were allowing that.

Wow, Terra Wolf's still going.

So for those of you guys

that were in a call this morning who took it,

then maybe you guys actually aren't as dumb as you seem.

Then again, I felt like I was pretty dumb

back in 2022

when like my three biggest positions

in my growth portfolio,

became Google, Palantir, and SoFi.

And I thought to myself,

am I fucking up?

Am I fucking up?

And now I don't feel so stupid,

but there was a time when I was,

I was questioning myself.

I still question myself every fucking day.

Thanks for Wolf.

This is not, you guys that go,

that listen to the morning call,

I need you to understand something.

I am just giving you the news, okay?

And interpreting it my way.

This is not a signal.

You motherfuckers say that.

You know what?

I'm starting to believe that none of you guys

actually take these things.

You're just saying that.

You're just saying that shit to fuck with me.

Because the one,

because the one time somebody actually believes,

oh shit, he gives out signals.

They pay for a morning call.

They come in, listen.

They're not there just to learn and have the news.

And they fucking take something

and it fucking wrecks their portfolio.

It's the one or two that week that don't work out

and they wreck everything.

And then they fucking write a manifesto

and they send it to my house.

And the next thing you know,

I'm having to fucking go in a witness,

you know what I mean?

Like, you know, I don't need that shit.

You still have Hutt?

Yeah, I'm concerned that I'm going to get,

um,

that Chase is going to be calling.

So this was yesterday at close.

This is my Chase account.

Now, obviously I have KDP and other things like that,

but this was yesterday before close

and some of these have popped a lot more since then.

But I'm wondering when Chase is going to call me again.

Lumen, because today Lumen is up

another half a percent to 940.

Hutt, Hutt is up to another 2%.

Reddit, NVIDIA, Togi, UNH,

Oshkosh, and CSR.

So, like, they're going to fucking call me again.

Yeah, but you're moving.

The manifestos are the next person's problems.

Why would they call you if you're winning?

So the joke is,

and what happened was,

is a while, a couple years ago,

I started putting money in my Chase account

because I was like, you know,

I can just transfer over from my checking business account

and put stuff in there.

So if I see something and I want to buy something,

because here's the thing.

Remember how I told you guys

I have different accounts for different portfolios?

The Chase account is one of those ones

where like when I do DD and research on the stream

and I'm like really like getting into a conviction play

and stuff like that,

and I'm thinking,

man, I want to buy this for this reason,

but I don't want to look at it.

I don't want to think about it for a while

outside of my like long-term portfolio

and my, you know, my IRA and stuff like that.

I started using my Chase portfolio.

And so what I did was,

is I was like, okay,

I've got this capital.

I'll transfer it over and I'll buy it

because I know I don't look at my Chase stock account ever.

I'll forget about it.

And so the first thing I did was

I bought like Lumen at a dollar,

a thousand shares a dollar.

And then like a couple months later,

it went a thousand percent.

And then I bought SFRM.

And then I bought, you know, whatever.

And then when Monkeypox hit again last year,

we remembered how we played Monkeypox a couple years ago.

So I bought SIGA and it went 400%

and I sold it and I bought GovX, the same one.

It went 300%.

And I was like, how has APDN not gone yet?

So I took all the profits and bought APDN at 25 cents.

It went a thousand percent.

And I was like, shit.

So then I took that and then I bought,

what was the other one?

I don't know.

It just kept happening.

And every time I bought something in the Chase account,

it just kept going nuts.

They suspended me for suspicious activity.

And so they called me and left a message.

And I'm like, this is a scammer, right?

So I called back to actual my Chase branch

and they were like, no, we're with the investment

management division.

And we just want to have a conversation,

whatever like that.

And it's like, hey, we've noticed that you've made

a lot of unusual trades recently.

And, you know, you didn't do anything wrong,

but they're like, you just used to just buy shares

of dollar cost because I like to send dollar cost

averaging for VU and VUG and stuff like that.

And IWM, especially the IWM.

And they're like, this is just whatever.

And so I was like, yeah, it's fine.

Everything's cool.

And then there was a conversation.

This other guy was like, you know, what about this one?

Eh, whatever.

And then I ended up, kept doing it.

And then when we got into Allure,

Allure ran a bunch, sold it.

It dropped like 70%.

I went fucking balls to the wall on it.

And then it went like 600%.

And I'm like, oh shit, this worked out.

And I went to sell it.

They would not, Chase would not let me sell it.

And they're like, please call the, this,

please contact.

Please contact.

And by the time I got through to them,

it went from up 600% to fucking red.

It actually was red by the time I could sell it.

And I was so pissed that I withdrew 70% of my account.

I withdrew 70% of my account.

I was so pissed.

I took all the profits out.

And then I bought Reddit, a shitload of it

when it went under $100.

And NVIDIA when it went under $100.

And now they've gone up.

And then I took some of the profit from that

and I bought UNH at 227.

And now it's up 60%.

And then I bought KDP, a big positioning

in KDP when it hit, when it went under $26

a couple of weeks ago.

And since then, Starboard has taken an activist role

and they beat Biddy Big on earnings.

So got lucky, but still.

Hello?

You want me to put Jack up outside?

But Jack is, okay, Bill.

You want me to put Jack up?

I can't put Jack up.

It's not Halloween time yet.

Jack is, Jack gonna be scared.

Wait, daddy's portfolio is exploding.

Daddy.

Daddy took a whole bunch of NNE calls yesterday.

All right?

You can go to college, maybe.

Speaking of which, do you want to see your college fund?

I put all of your college fund into one stock.

And it's called Better.

Look.

And I did this last year.

You might go to a good college.

All right.

You gonna go put up Jack?

All right.

Let's talk about Jack gotta go up.

Oh, hello?

The steroids just resubbed for three months.

I'm a boring investor, 38 years old.

I've got a $400 weekly reoccurring buy into VTI.

I've got 15% of my pay in my 401k going to VTSAX.

I paid down my mortgage to 25,000, invested my HSA with a net worth north of 300,000.

I've got 200 shares of SoFi at 768.

I feel like I've done okay for myself.

But seeing these DJs on Wall Street Bet make millions on a roulette wheel is seriously

disheartening.

Just remember one thing.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

There is a lot of money in the stock market.

But seeing these DJs on Wall Street Bet make millions on a roulette wheel is seriously

disheartening.

What happened to this board?

We called the discount circles.

This was a great meeting for us at PSB Names like Have You Plsted.

We regretted prospecting at PSB Names so much.

Not really.

It was a great meeting.

I've said that a couple times now.

What we realized actually is that it was the price of a cheap paper.

I was all like umverling there.

We had a BRRROS, you know where I grew up.

circa this cuttée stuff.

fake one guy got busted photoshopping recently because he effed it up also i want you to see

something um what they do is is they'll be down they'll take yolos and they'll go from a hundred

thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars and then post their ten thousand dollar to sixty thousand

dollar gain and you think they're a genius and then the ones who do do well think here's the

here's the worst thing about gambling and being a dgen the worst thing about gambling is when you

win wait i'm seriously how did how did my n and e play work out that's not that wasn't supposed to

happen okay the worst thing you can do is win because once you do that you think you have it

figured out okay you think you have it figured out it's like in the stock market okay the moment

you think you've got it figured out is the moment you get wrecked because you start taking more risk

and you think oh it's okay i was right i was right

you

being safe and i was right if i just would have been a little less safe i would have done it

here's the thing in 10 years you're going to look back and you're going to be sitting pretty

these guys are going to be having to gamble money they don't have just to try to get halfway to

break even do not do that i'm telling you right now i made that mistake in the beginning and you

know what i did when i effed up something a light clicked on in my head and i said you know what

instead of trying to get back the money i lost trying to be that guy because we're not that guy

or girl

i'm just going to do it the right way and that was the best decision ever made because looking back

how do you how do you how do you give up five to ten to fifteen percent gains every fucking year

compounding like it just goes insane one bad play it's all gone here's the problem one good play you

fucking do it two good plays you're mooning three good plays you're fucking you're you're sitting

pretty but fuck if i can do it three times i can do it four times then it's all gone i have yet to

find somebody who has just been doing what you're doing and i'm just going to do it the right way

and i'm just going to do it the right way and i'm just going to do it the right way and i'm just going

over a long period of time and look back and said you know what i wish i fucking gambled it all

instead sure we're having fun we're making money right but we're using a small portion of our

portfolio understanding the fact that whatever we're using right now could go to zero it shouldn't

you should never let it go to zero but it could if you are if you are actively trading with enough

money that if for some reason it went to zero it would financially cripple you you're you're you're

doing too much okay here's the thing you need to do and i'm gonna be really honest with you if you're

with you you need to do something for yourself see you've you've dotted all the i's and crossed

all the t's you're setting yourself up for a fucking easy coast life later on but you're

getting bored it's monotonous for you you need to find something to do you need to take some money

and do something for yourself okay take a few bucks go to go to vegas and go gambling go to

fucking the the caribbean well not even not not jamaica right now but another another place in

caribbean

go fucking snorkeling or or or or you know what go to texas and go in a fucking helicopter and

hunt wild boars or you know go parachute or or or or base jump off of off of the in yosemite right

now because all these people are doing it because it's illegal right now do something crazy have

some fun because the problem is is that when you don't do that you end up making decisions down

the while it's like it's like it's like it's like you know holding in a nut for too long

you know what i mean like you need to get some pnc at some point all right before you fuck around

all right you know it you've got to do that and and the problem is is that we're so scared

that it's an all or nothing world right like hey boys and girls today's word is moderation

say it with me moderation see you've got the dave ramses of the world who are boomers who

haven't gotten with the time and they think you should starve okay starve yourself that way you

can eat when you're hungry and you can eat when you're hungry and you can eat when you're hungry

okay but what if you don't get to be older you wasted a lot of time what if you get hit by a

drunk driver and you're a quadriplegic well that money doesn't really do much for you

bet you wish you would have had some fun when you were younger society tells you spend you

gotta be a good little spender gotta have the latest gotta have the greatest that's right kids

gotta spend everything gotta look good gotta have a great car chicks won't want to fuck you

you're gonna die broke and alone so we need to find moderation that's right kids moderation safe

but also enjoy your life because it's short i'm sorry i blacked out oh no kids how i went from

sesame street to oh mickey mouse here guess what here's your mouse tool today's mouse tool is

moderation okay moderation you gotta

moderate because if you don't moderate mean he's gonna go behind your back and fuck donald

and then when you find out about it she sends you a picture of her getting split roasted by

by goofy and pluto i always told her i wanted to go to to to to france to see the eiffel tower

but that wasn't what i meant apparently my my apparently my mouse tool isn't good enough

anymore to be fair dave ramsay only advocates for starving yourself bit when you have high

interest debt to clear his view on investing is a little sus though i'm not really giving

shit to dave ramsay dave ramsay has a lot of money and he's got a lot of money and he's got a lot of

money and he has a lot of a lot of good takes uh i think a lot of his some of his takes are a little

bit uh outdated um and he he's kind of stuck in that way um i'm a believer that you don't want to

have debt but i also understand that debt creates wealth in the same time um i think paying down

your house if you have a sub four percent interest rate as opposed to taking that money and putting

it in the market is not a good take um i believe in moderation in that also i think you know if you

for investing you should take 20 attack the principle of your of your mortgage 80 in the

market or even if it's a 60 40 portfolio kind of thing you know um but to each their own but i get

why he's also like the boot camp kind because there's a lot of people that need tough love

i just like to say that because it's like a it's like an ongoing fake beef that i have with dave

ramsay that's a good example dave ramsay's like the aa for for spending alcoholics or spendaholics

well the good news is is our netflix calls are fucking booming from yesterday

we just bought it we just bought it a few uh about 30 minutes ago fence sitting again he sucks

it's not fence sitting it's being an adult um understanding that somebody you disagree with

somebody but they're not entirely wrong is wow we i think we almost timed the bottom here uh is fine

it's okay i feel like people cannot ever feel like they're allowed to two things can be can be

at the same time someone can can can be old in their ways and give good advice to a certain

section of people but their advice is not good for everybody you see what i mean look at me i i'm i'm

literally a guy on twitch you know what i mean like that is not where you want to get financial

advice from but i have some decent takes sometimes jesus are you you calls are going vertical from

yesterday that is what this is my portfolio this morning i'm not going to be able to get financial

right now i and i was playing it conservative i need this to pay for the fucking baos appointment

we're going to in a little bit exactly people think i'm a degenerate because i i do some day

trades and stuff like that but once they realize that i actually put thought into a lot of my

trades and i'm not actively trading with a ton of my account they're like oh okay being degenerate

with a small amount but then also being smart with most almost everything makes more sense

it's that balance it's that moderation motherfucker you own ag faf you are degenerate no i

ag faf the amount i bought on uh was on accident i'm an idiot because instead of cutting it for a

loss i was like i'm going to keep this for content not realizing i was going to lose every penny

that that was just a lesson learned speaking of good old days i was clearing out the attic

and you remember the giant teddy bear that used to be in the corner here my first started streaming

i found it how many sources do i have to have good knowledge about investments there's a million

types of investments what kind of investment are you talking about you're talking about the total

market

the less knowledge you have probably the better just understand the difference between a 401k and

an ira a traditional and a roth right an employer match and stuff like that understand an hsa and

understand dollar cost averaging on vu that's all you have to do and then forget everything else

you only need one inside source shut up don't play stupid stocky what visa call did you take

listen listen linda listen listen listen listen linda listen listen listen listen listen listen

okay listen thank you for the paypal signal that wasn't a signal yesterday all i said was is that

yesterday the reason i played it yesterday was because of the mastercard thing and then we made

a joke about watch them announce something with ai or open ai and then we had earnings so i i waited

for a pullback i took two calls and i sold them for 150 and now i'm going to regret that it's just

one why are you bullish on mirror um it's not that i'm not bullish on mirror i'm not bullish on mirror

bullish on mirror it's that i'm being speculative on mirror because a lot of people didn't get into

oklo at 19 like we did or nne at 14 like we did right and smr had already run and so a lot of

people are fomoing and they're looking for the next one and while you it's a big news on some

of the other ones like ccj and bam and and wab or whatever this morning mirror spent 700 million

dollars to buy a nuclear reactor module

reactor company. And then they immediately did an offering to pay for it. And it gapped right up,

which shows me that people are hungry. And so if people are FOMOing and looking for the next one,

it might be the one that people are looking at. It's completely speculative. I have leaps that

are two years out. So it's not anything crazy. But it's just me personally. It's just me

personally. And I actually sold one mere leap for $660 yesterday to buy two PayPal calls for $600

or whatever. And then those actually flipped really nicely today. I don't want to look at it

right now. But you guys that are in shorter dated ones are happy. I only have three. But this is

cheaper than me taking shares. I have over two years until these expire. And they're already

up 52%. I had six. I had six. I had six. I had six. I had six. I had six. I had six. I had six.

six of them. I have three left. Okay. But again, this is not, I'm not trading this off of Mir's

balance sheet. I'm not trading this off of Mir's past. I'm doing this because I'm trying, I try to

get behind the brain and the, and the mind of, of, of, uh, you know, retail investors, retail

traders, as well as institutions that are trying to get ahead of retail. And so that's why we're

doing this. So we played this on the daily here and then we averaged down. And then, um, when it

went up, uh, we, we legged out of some of it and now I'm holding the rest of it here. This was the

offering that they did. Um, and it gapped back up and it's right back to that even. But again, um,

this is, this is me. Just, this is not, you should not do this. Okay. I'm doing my own thing. I am

not a signal service. I am not a fucking, I am an entertainer and educator. Okay. I'm not anything

else. Um, but, uh, this was the, uh, the news that, uh, that got me into it. Um,

there's the offering. And then, um, where is the actual, uh, yeah, here we go.

Mir almost bankrupted this discord. It took three days for it to gap up. How does that

bankrupt? Unless you took daily fucking options or it doesn't even make sense.

Okay. Whatever. Let me just do this. Um, here you go. This is what got me into it.

So Miragon or Mirion is going to acquire Paragon energy solutions. Uh, and they're the, uh, leading

providers of highly energized, uh, or engineered solutions for large scale nuclear reactions and

small module reactors. So this is them playing the, the, instead of being the casino, like

investing in the casino. And so now they are going, they're basically buying a portfolio for

SMRs and it's 585 million. They did an offering to pay for it. And it immediately got, got bought

up. Like it gapped up. So when I,

I see that there's someone else entering into the arena and they're already a, a power company

that's already there. They're not, this isn't their only thing. Like NNE, Oklo doesn't make

any money. Oklo we're up a thousand percent on shares and, or 1200% on shares, but they,

they don't even make any money. These guys actually had a business before that. They just

basically went out and said, you know what, instead of developing, let's go out and buy

somebody else. So others who are looking at this may say, Hmm, SMRs are the future, or we still

think this is a data center thing, or we think nuclear energy, the whole reason we got into

nuclear a few years ago, it wasn't even SMRs. We didn't even think about data centers back

then. We were doing it because of the, uh, basically, uh, a transition between, uh, fossil

fuels and green energy. Since we knew green energy, it wasn't nearly as far along as we

thought it was after the invasion of Russia to Ukraine and the natural gas and oil got cut off

to the EU. So this was just a, an added bonus, but these guys are entering it. They're, they're

entering the arena and does it work out for them? I don't know, but I know that there's a lot of

FOMO on people who missed NNE and Oklo, and this is still priced in the $26 range. And so this may

be one, if it starts getting attention,

people may say, Hmm, I missed those, but I'll get this one. That's kind of what I'm looking at.

Yeah. I, I, I, I bought the mirror dip pretty hard. I know you're up huge because you,

you took shorter dated. I took 2028. I meant to buy 2027. I bought 2028, but it is what it is.

But yeah, that's, that's it. Wow. We actually nailed D pro. That was our only after, uh,

open trade that we took, I think, uh, on, uh, on shares. Damn. RMBS was a great play this morning.

I'm down half a percent on car. I want to play this till the end of day. I'm going to put a

1% trailing stop loss. Just in case we ride, have a nice day. Microsoft open AI news this

morning. SGBX starting to move again. Big, big pump after hours yesterday. Um, GPUS has been

insane. 88% now on this run. Oh shit. Intel. Our Intel shares are up 112% now. Did you cut jet blue?

Nope. Um, I have a 3% and a 5% trailing stop loss on the shares. And I got filled on the calls at,

I think an average of 20 a piece. They're at 8%.

Right now. So I'm down about a 10%. Sorry for asking again. And the last time, but what was

your best advice would be dating an Indian girl. Much appreciated. You want to hear this more than

him? Wait, hold on. No, I was looking at you for advice. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Um, first thing

you're going to do is you got to make a good chai tea or chai tea is tea. You don't drink tea. You

don't come with gold either. Okay. Um, you got to make a good chai. I put a recipe in, um, how,

okay. How Indian is she? What kind of,

ask somebody how Indian she is. That's he's going to get canceled. He's not even on the internet.

First off, make sure she comes with gold. Okay. That's the first thing you need to figure out.

Okay. Let me make sure she likes gold. I don't care if you like gold. Hell, if you didn't like

gold to be even better, it'd be easier to part with it if I needed to. Okay. I, if you hit

exclamation point chai, I put a really like, you know, elaborate fucking, uh, recipe for, for,

for masala chai. If you want to just go regular, do the same thing, but just with two cardamoms,

some fennel seeds and, uh,

some cinnamon sticks, uh, and some ginger. That's it. It's easy. But that's the first thing you want

to do because, because I got to do this. My wife was actually talking last night about our first

date and she goes, cause remember our first date. Well, our first meeting was not a date. I thought

it was a date. She thought she was meeting somebody to help them with their charity that I was kind of

BS and about on my dating profile, but it got her there. Right. Um, but she told me last night,

the reason she decided to go on a second or to go on a real date with me the next time was because

while we were talking and bullshitting, I started making fun of the people that

were sitting like a couple of seats over from us. And she thought it was hilarious

that I was making fun of people. I'm like, you're fucking sick. So the first thing you do is lie.

Um, I think, I mean, every Indian girl's different. I guess, I guess just like every

American girl's different. Like, what do you mean your advice on it? Like, I don't know. Is she

North Indian? Is she South Indian? Is she Punjabi, but also a Delhiite? Is she from Mumbai? Is she

like, is she here? Like, was she born here? Was she born there? Did she come over here? Did she

do her school here? You know, I don't know. There's a lot of things there.

The two things that made my wife, and I think almost any woman, uh, you know, not any woman,

not to say that obviously, you know, looks play a deal with it, but I did, I was actually kind

of plumpy when I first met her and whatever, but I was funny and I had confidence. I don't think

people realize how much having a sense of humor and confidence goes. I think people really

misunderstand that. Like we we've lost track of that. Like, you know, it is what it is. Um,

but, um, Delhi studying abroad in Europe. Are you in Europe?

Studying abroad? Wait a second. So you're just trying to hit it, quit it. Cause she's going back

to India. Don't do that, man. Don't do that. Similar, similar profile is you. What the fuck

does that even mean? A similar profile? What are you? Uh, not when I met you, you were working at

FPL. Speaking of working at FPL, remember how I told y'all I was going through all of our old

shit in the attic. So I found something. Oh no, no, it's too late now. I got you now.

So apparently I don't remember getting these. And if I did, I, I just, I, I forgot about it.

Apparently when her and I first moved in together, okay. Before we were officially married,

you harlot. Apparently she made one of those little coupon books for me. You know, those

little stupid coupon books that we act are cute, but it's really just because we forgot to buy a

present and we have to make something up last second. She has these little coupon books, look

two head massages. And she meant this one expires 2020 or 2017 walk and feed our dog.

At the time in the morning, no idea why she put this one strip naked dance and blank.

Like I get, I have to have a coupon for that. Didn't even know how to do that at the time.

Why are you laughing? You didn't even know how to do that. Like, why would you give me that as a

coupon? I had to teach you. This might get you past a million on Tik TOK. Okay. That's not what

we do. Imagine what's happening behind the camera where you can't see I'm wearing shorts today. At

least this is the stream.

That you didn't ask for, but you needed just like we need jet blue to fucking get a little bit of

teeth in it before the end of the day. Okay. Um, okay. We're going to lose more people. Thanks

to the GPS signal, not a signal service. Uh, after hours, guys, we have more, we have, we're

going to lose a lot of people this week. Wednesday is going to be brutal. Okay. It's going to be

brutal, good or bad. I don't know, but let me tell you something. We have the fed rate decision

Wednesday afternoon pre-market. We have Verizon, Boeing, CVS, Caterpillar, and Etsy earnings after

hours though. We go.

With fed rate decision at 2 p.m. Powell taking the stadium, the podium at 2 30. Now 24 of the last

27 times Powell has taken the podium. The S and P 500 has fallen at least 1% or more before end of

day. However, last time it fell over 1% and then gapped up. So a little bit different. And then

after hours, we, after close, we have meta Microsoft and Apple all reporting earnings.

So we look above you look below you. We are going to lose. Somebody here is not going to be here on

Thursday or, or Friday or the following Monday. I just want you to be aware of that. Okay. Okay. Go

to hell guys. Nvidia CEO is speaking now. I thought he was speaking at, at 12. What time's the

appointment for bail? Oh God, I was trying to forget about it. I'm fucking pit in my stomach

right now. Jewish voters, union workers, young people, you know, demographics that had not

traditionally in recent years been with the Republican party in long, large numbers. And

they came to us not reluctantly with, but with hopeful anticipation. Why? Because they wanted a

return to common sense. And they saw what the other party had done to them with their terrible

policies and their terrible idea. Do they have any radical woke Marxist progressive agenda? And

they realized it didn't work for them. So they came to us and they said, can you do they not

have a, a different, um, that's the one big, beautiful bill, the working families tax cut and

all of our legislation and everything the president's done with executive orders, doing his

promises are codifying those things and doing the rest of our legislative agenda agenda, which is

being held up right now because this, um,

we're delivering for those people. So it is not a surprise to me that union workers would come

enthusiastically supporting common sense. We, what we're asking for here is common sense. They're

supporting the party. They're supporting the president because they know who's working for

the American people and who is not, who is causing an inflicting pain on the American people. The

contrast has never been more clear. We say all the time, this is not your father's democratic party.

I grew up in Louisiana when I was a kid. I didn't even know. It definitely isn't your father.

Everybody was Democrat and you know, the Southern Democrats, you know,

conservative Democrats down Louisiana, that party doesn't exist anymore. My, my grandfather would not,

not recognize what this party has become. He would clearly, I don't think he realizes what

he's saying when he says it's not the old democratic families, hardworking, middle class,

lower class earners in the, in the, in the country. We drafted the working families tax cut. What does

the term gapped up mean for them to help basically, um, if something trades at a certain level and

then falls and then returns to that level, that's called gapping up.

See that.

They see the effects. Ideas have consequences, my friends, and the policies and ideas that are

advanced of the Republican party are right for America because they comport with our founding

principles. And we stand on those principles to defend them. And on, by contrast, on the other

side of the screen, they're going for communism and Marxism. Take your choice. Jake Valkyrie

should run for house speaker. Why we voted September 19th, the fund, every one of those

priorities.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

So we've got the Democrats.

I'm the only Democrat in the House except one voted to not fund them. The Democrats are playing games.

They put a few of the one off bills on the floor. As you've seen in the last week or so they put a bill to pay the troops and pay essential workers. And the Democrats voted it down. So it would be a futile legislative effort for us to, to do this again.

Repetitively in the house and send it over there. So Chuck Shearer and the gang can play games and spike it. It's a waste of our time. They need to vote for the clean, continuing nonpartisan CR.

It's harder than a girl's drink at a TwitchCon party.

Oh, God, I'm going to get in trouble.

They were always on the calendar for the remainder of the year.

I want to thank our Republican Study Committee colleagues for being here

and standing in the gap for your constituents.

All the Republicans out there, they're still at work.

They're not even watching these press conferences

because they're working for their constituents.

Thanks for that. Appreciate it.

I'm just talking on mute.

Speaking of government shutdown, we have more and more air traffic controllers.

We have more and more air traffic controllers that are not going to work.

Because they're not getting paid

and they're using their sick leave and whatnot in order to take the time off.

And so more and more flights are getting canceled.

LAX is actually having flights canceled right now.

And so, you know, I think the air traffic controllers, in my opinion,

hold the key to the government shutdown.

I'm telling you right now.

I think the government shutdown is in the hands of the air traffic controllers.

And I'm not trying to, like, be like,

oh, my God.

You know, fucking, you know, make a political opinion or statement here.

It's just, if flights get grounded, the government is going to open up the next day.

Or at least they'll pass a standalone bill to fund the air traffic controllers.

That's a doomer take.

Well, one of two things would happen.

Either A, the government would have to go into the call up National Guard

or active duty air traffic controllers to come do it.

Or they would have to do a standalone bill.

And if they do a standalone bill, it's going to be harder for people.

For them to come back and say the other side XYZ because they do that.

Okay.

All right.

And if I remember correctly, it was, that was one of the big reasons that the big government shutdown in 2018 ended

was just because flights were getting grounded.

The SNAP benefits are getting talked about a lot right now.

And it's at a point where they're saying that the SNAP benefits are going to go out on November 1st.

And that the federal funding does end on November 1st.

But a lot of states are going to step up to cover that in the short term, but not all states.

And, you know, one thing that I found interesting from this whole thing is a lot of people are very upset saying,

wow, we might have got out of PayPal at a good time.

Or saying, you know, why, you know, good.

There's no reason that 40 million people need to be on SNAP benefits and whatnot.

And my thought is, is even if not all of those people are using the program,

correctly, because, you know, whatever.

But, hey, listen, let's hurt 98% of people to go after the 2% of people that are abusing a program.

My thing is, is why are 40 million Americans qualifying for it?

Like, why, why, why, not like they shouldn't qualify, but why is it that 40 million Americans make so little that they qualify for it?

Like, that's a lot of people.

You know, I think it's something that we think about from an economic standpoint.

I'm not a socialist.

It's just a question.

It's not about your take on.

If people, you know, get it or don't get it, and it's somebody abusing it or whatever, it's why are there for why is it that 40 million Americans make so little that they, they, they, they, they qualify for it again, not making a political statement here because I don't need to.

I think everybody already knows what they feel about this, but that's just an interesting thing that I was looking at.

It's just, it's wild.

Nobody is going to starve in this country.

I've watched people starve.

I used to, and this is a true story.

This shutdown shows that we don't need.

The government, as somebody who voted for a libertarian in a presidential, uh, uh, election, I can tell you something right now that we need the government.

Maybe not all of the way it's been, you know, like there's a lot of waste in the government, but you think that the government employees are still working.

There's a misconception here.

The government employees are still working.

The government employees aren't not working.

The country isn't just running on its own.

This isn't a fucking anarchy running.

They're just not getting paid.

They're about to miss their first paycheck.

Do we have too many government?

Employees maybe, or is the money that is being, uh, used to fund the government being miss, miss, uh, managed, uh, grossly apps of fucking lootly.

Absolutely.

But everyone's afraid to, to, to restructure something or take funding away from everything because they don't want to have political suicide.

But the government isn't, the employees aren't not working.

Okay.

All right.

People are still working.

Okay.

And I'm not, and this isn't, this isn't, again, this isn't some kind of bullshit fucking stock.

He's making a take on small government versus big government versus.

So that I'm just telling you a fact.

Okay.

We, we, we, whether, whether for, for good or for bad, we are at a point in our, in our, in our world where we need the government to function.

I mean, it just, it is, you, you can't not have it.

You think, you think, you think that the world is crazy.

Now you think America is crazy now.

Okay.

You may hate police and that's fine.

You're, you're, you're very, you know, within your rights to, to, to, to, to question police and the way that, that, that, that things happen.

But let me tell you something.

If police were gone tomorrow, it's not the fucking movies.

Where, oh, well, neighborhoods will come together and police their own and shit like that.

Okay.

As much as I detest it, that's why it's like, you don't want to dissolve something.

You want to fix something.

You want to make it more efficient.

Right.

But the problem is, is that when you have a government that gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it just gets more hands off because there's so many people in so many agencies and there's so much money going to it that there's no way of keeping up with it.

So it just, it, it doesn't get, there's no accountability.

There's no, there's no, there's no structure.

Okay.

This is not a test.

This is your emergency broadcast system.

Think about what would happen if school buses stopped running, right?

What happens if the trash doesn't get picked up?

If the sewer lines aren't fucking taken care of?

Okay.

If your water isn't taken care of, if, if, you know, the roads aren't fixed, not that they get fixed all the time.

Anyways, as much as our government, local municipal state county and federal government mismanages shit and it needs to be fixed.

You can't just absolve it.

And I, like I said, I'm not going to do that.

Like I said, and I'm not, I'm not trying to preach to you, but as somebody who was at one time, a very big believer in, we don't really need the federal government except for just military defense and, and, and, you know, uh, treaties and stuff like that.

Right?

Like the full libertarian thing.

I started actually going past the fucking talking points and looking at what would happen if we brought things back to the municipal level.

And it's not possible anymore.

Do I think states have given up too much of their autonomy and their control to the federal government?

Of course they did.

They did it in return for federal funding, right?

Because some states rely on subsidies from other states and those states rely on those states to be subsidized for their food or for, for their, for their whatever.

And there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a symbiotic, kind of a symbiotic relationship.

Sometimes it's more one sided than the other, but we're just at that point where it's not, this isn't 1800s anymore.

You know what I mean?

And so we, we unfortunately need the government, but we also need the government to be more efficient.

And the problem is, is that no one is going to fix the government.

No one is going to fix the government because where are you going to take money away from?

You're giving too much money to too many people, or I shouldn't say people.

I should say entities, corporations, um, uh, groups, uh, you know, whatever you're giving too much money away.

And instead of fixing it, you're just saying, I'll just keep throwing more money at it.

Cause then they'll, they, they won't bother me.

But once you give money, you can't take money back.

And so it's just this perpetual problem where you don't fix it.

It just eventually falls apart or the confidentiality.

Confidence goes away.

Now it hasn't happened yet because we're still the big military and the spending we have,

and because everybody in the world is running on the same type of economic system.

As long as you're the company, the one with the biggest financials,

the biggest consumerism and the biggest military, then you just continue to be the leader in that.

Um, that's why people keep saying American empire is going to collapse.

We're past individual empires.

We're on a global empire.

Okay.

We are at a global empire right now.

There it's too interconnected.

Everyone owes everybody fucking bullshit money that that could ever be paid back.

If America collapsed,

if China collapses,

everyone collapses.

I mean,

that's just how it is.

If China collapses,

everyone collapses.

Some people will bounce back faster,

but it's,

this is too,

this isn't one of those ones where it's like,

Oh,

this empire collapses.

It's not like when the Roman empire collapsed and it was like,

okay,

or the Byzantine empire or the fucking,

you know,

whatever.

It's different now.

It's just different.

The whole world is interconnected and everything's at light speed and it's only getting more that way.

So it's everybody just propping everybody else up with some bullshit consumer confidence or,

or economic confidence because we can't afford to have somebody not.

All right.

It's pure globalization.

And if that is,

if that is the way it is,

that's the way it is.

Um,

but,

uh,

but yeah,

as far as the government,

yeah,

nobody wants to do the fixing because it's political suicide.

Who are you going to take money from?

All right.

We're going to talk about the cheese caves again.

Goddamn right.

I will.

Cheese caves is all I love talking about it.

Subsidize all those fucking dairy farmers because we need more dairy.

We get it.

Now,

all of a sudden we don't need as much dairy,

but we can't take the money away from it because if we take all the subsidies away,

the,

the fucking dairy farmers strike and we lose our dairy and we're,

we're,

we're soft and we're,

we're in a bad situation.

So what do we do?

Fucking just keep funding them.

Just keep giving their subsidies and take all the extra fucking milk,

turn into cheese and put it in the cheese caves in Missouri.

Just hide it.

That's just how we are.

That's just where we're at.

I don't like it,

but that's where we're at.

Oh shit.

Those EHR calls we bought yesterday are booming.

At least give the milk away for free in the schools again or something.

Um,

they did,

but they,

they,

they stopped,

uh,

the kids stopped drinking the milk too.

Honestly,

um,

last year we didn't get a chance to,

um,

do a community,

um,

fundraiser to,

to pay off school lunches for kids.

I did it on my own.

Um,

but I know you guys like being part of it and with the shutdown and the,

and the child benefits,

even though they,

they're,

they're probably gonna get funded by the state,

uh,

or just put on like a,

a,

a,

an IOU system.

Uh,

I think it's a good year to do it.

Yeah.

Well,

the thing is,

is that,

is that,

is that,

um,

milk is like eggs where it goes from.

It's good for you.

It's not good for you.

It's good for you.

It's not good for you back and forth.

And more people are lactose,

intolerant,

more people are trying to be health conscious.

So,

uh,

they're not drinking milk as much.

I mean,

my kids drink a shit ton of milk.

Um,

and I had to move my daughter to 2% because,

because,

uh,

she's just at that age where she starts to get a little belly,

you know?

And,

and so I had to switch it up a little bit,

but they drink,

uh,

you know,

they,

they drink,

you know,

my son drinks like three bottles,

three full bottles a day.

You know what I mean?

They drink a lot of milk.

Um,

but,

uh,

you know,

it's,

it's not something that,

you know,

a lot of people,

you know,

drink.

And then there's also a health conscious thing where people are moving away from,

uh,

processed milk to,

uh,

free range cow milk to organic milk to fucking,

you know,

fucking straight up,

you know,

raw milk to breast milk to whatever,

you know,

don't most Indians doing that?

Yeah.

It's funny too,

because in India,

uh,

for milk,

uh,

for a lot of Indians,

milk is like almost like a,

an expensive,

like delicacy,

not a delicacy,

but like a,

uh,

uh,

what do you call it?

It's the word I'm looking for.

Like,

um,

I don't know.

You know what I'm trying to say?

It's a luxury.

Yeah.

So,

you know,

and a lot of Indians are vegetarian,

so they need to get their protein from somewhere.

And while they can get it from,

you know,

tofu and,

and,

and paneer and stuff like that.

And cheese is milk is a,

is a big way of doing it.

Please make sure that you're warning people,

the dangers of raw milk.

I didn't say you should drink raw milk.

I said,

what people are doing.

You don't need a fucking streamer to be your goddamn fucking health,

uh,

advisor.

That's right.

Stucky.

I only listened to the worm.

Okay,

bro.

What's your take on milk?

It's overrated.

Milk is fucking overrated.

That's my take on it.

Okay.

Fucking overrated.

All right.

I don't think you shouldn't drink milk.

I just think it's overrated.

And that's because I grew up in the nineties when we taught,

we,

I taught you guys that the U S government literally did a paid campaign to

make people drink more milk,

not because they wanted you to be healthy,

but because they fucked up and spent too much goddamn money on the dairy

milk.

Farmers and they were,

and they were producing too much milk and it was going to waste.

And they're like,

well shit,

if we're doing this,

we're going to have to at least justify it down the road.

So we need to spend even more money to get the got milk ad campaign to get

people to drink more milk because now we have an oversupply of milk because we

had an undersupply.

We subsidize the farmers or the dairy farmers and then we had too much milk.

We need people to drink it.

Then they made all the fucking cheese caves and then that's why you have cheese

stuff,

crust cheese on your pizza and cheese and your cheesy gordita crunch and cheese,

cheese,

cheese,

cheese on every fucking fast food.

Because the government said these fast food places,

we need to get offload some of this cheese and you guys want new menu items.

We'll give you a huge discount on some fucking cheese.

And that's why you have that funny when you don't know about how shit happens

and then you learn about it and it fucking blows your mind.

Yo dog,

I heard you like cheese.

So I put some cheese on your cheese.

Okay.

But they were cooking with stuffed crust.

Don't get me wrong with that.

I'm just saying like it worked out for them.

I mean there was a point where they,

they,

cause the problem was is that they didn't have enough fucking dairy and they

had to get it more so they had to give money.

Subsidies to bring out these farmers,

these dairy to get more dairy farmers,

you know,

dairy rancher or whatever you want to call them.

And cause I can't,

you can't be a dairy farmer.

I guess you have to be a dairy rancher.

That's a weird thing to say.

And so then they,

they had an over abundance and then people got lactose intolerant or people just

didn't want to drink it.

And people started getting health conscious and then it just like people started

going fucking vegan and shit.

And so they just,

but they couldn't take the money away.

You couldn't say,

Hey farmers,

remember how we've been giving you billions of dollars every year in subsidies so

that you could keep your prices lower.

And we could get people to buy it and we could also get the supply out there.

Yeah.

We need to stop giving you all that money and all they would do is like if you

do that,

we're just not going to give you any milk and then you can have a real fucking

problem on your hands.

So what does the government do?

All right,

fuck it.

Just keep it.

We'll just make it into cheese or we'll spend billions of dollars more to,

to,

to,

to make,

you know,

uh,

you know,

a fucking Taylor Swift put a fucking milk mustache on,

you know what I mean?

Like,

and now think about that in all of these government programs.

Good sell on PayPal stocky.

Uh,

I mean,

I missed the top,

but I'll take it.

Jet blue started to climb a bit.

Actually the one that hurts the most.

And I know some of you guys are still in it.

Y'all remember the,

um,

y'all remember the company that we found that quietly got the,

after the government announced a uranium reserve and then we found a company

that was given a government contract to enrich uranium,

despite the fact that that's what we're telling everybody they're not allowed

to do.

And then we took calls on it and we bought them for $750 and sold them for

1100.

Right?

Yeah.

So those same calls,

um,

the one 95 calls for February for BW XT,

um,

$4,000 this morning.

Oh shit.

Car finally at 60.

Wow.

We nailed the bottom on D pro this morning.

Good play.

It's been,

it's been money every time it goes under nine bucks.

Thanks for UEC.

Not a signal service storm hitting the coast of Jamaica right now.

I'm trying to understand how stock trading works as a business model.

What are the people called that teach stock strategy?

And show people how to trade stocks effectively and make a majority of their

money from teaching stocks.

Uh,

scammers.

Those are called scammers,

course sellers.

So what you do is,

is you,

is you convince people that you have figured out the secret.

Okay.

You've figured out the secret.

Okay.

And you know how to do what no one else does.

And you've done it so good that people can pay you to learn how to do it too.

Right?

Like me.

I say,

I'm an idiot with a camera.

Don't do what I do.

I'm taking this because of X,

Y,

Z.

You should do your own research.

I get lucky sometimes.

Also the reason that I do it live and they don't do it live because if they did it live,

everyone find out that it's not as easy as they make it seem and that they're not good.

They're posting screenshots or fake fucking whatever,

or they're down big time.

And then they only post when they're up a certain period of time.

They don't do all that.

They can't do it live.

They get exposed.

Those people are what you call selling.

As I always said,

if you want to get rich,

lie to people who want to be lied to.

If you want to make a living,

tell the truth to people want to hear the truth.

If you want to go broke,

tell the truth.

People want to be lied to.

Okay.

For example,

I don't do any courses or I don't teach people or tell people how to do this.

The only thing I offer is a morning call and it's just news.

Hey,

do you want to get up every morning and spend two and a half hours going through the news

and finding out what's happening and trying to figure out how that works in the market

or what that could mean or stuff about stocks and how that could play into it,

whatever like that.

Go for it.

Or if you want to sleep in,

roll out of bed and get 75 cents to have some idiot do it for you,

then do it.

But nothing I do is proprietary.

Literally all the information that I get is out on the internet.

You have to spend the morning doing it and you have to spend about probably a thousand

bucks a month to have access to all of it because everybody's got a fucking paywall now.

But for time and convenience and I do that and I'm a stupid for only charging that much.

I refuse to do courses and stuff like that.

And I could probably do a educational course on just

understanding the world and understanding the world.

Understanding things, not how to do things, but what things are like.

What does what does, you know, this mean, right?

Like what does a buy and a sell or ask bid spread mean, right?

Or what does, you know, RSI indicate or what is a P.E. ratio?

What is R.O.I.C.?

Like doing a course on just understanding that if you want to do fundamentals and stuff like that,

not what is good, but what it means.

Or, you know, I could do something like that.

Like.

Understanding how to set up a 401k, the difference between a Roth and a traditional IRA and a 401k.

What management fees and expense ratios are and how that affects you, right?

Like I could probably do that.

I'm just I don't ever remember to do something like that.

But no, I don't.

I don't.

I don't think that that's a good model because eventually you're going to get exposed.

Once the market turns into a downturn, all those people get wiped out.

People realize that they were full of shit and they disappear.

They take their money and run and then a new wave of people come in.

Why haven't you done any educational course?

Because I have ADHD and I forget to do shit.

I mean, is one positive dude here?

I just saw him in my...

OJ underscore simp just resubbed for 49 months.

Yesterday when I was rewatching the stream where he said,

you want to know what ADHD is?

For three years, Stocky has had the wrong link to his Instagram on Twitch and in chat and hasn't fixed it.

And he's right, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Same reason where my merch link broke three years ago and all I had to do was go in and reset it

and sell my merch again and I haven't done it because I'm like, oh, I'll do it later.

I'll do it later.

I'll do it later.

I have never returned an Amazon item.

I own every single Amazon return that I was supposed to take back and I live a mile from a USPS.

I'm not bragging.

This is a fucking serious issue I have.

It has destroyed so much of my life.

We were going through memories yesterday.

I couldn't even remember some of it.

I wasn't present.

Is SoFi a good buy right now?

Do you think SoFi is going to be worth more in a year, five years, ten years than it is now?

Then it's a good buy.

I take...

I wait until the...

I mean, I was the same kid who never did any...

I aced all my tests in school but I never turned in homework.

Every time I had homework, I had all the time in the world to do it the night before in the morning

and I waited until I got to the class and I was like, shit, and tried doing it.

I had six months to do fucking school projects.

I did it the night before.

And all...

And the only way...

And I passed it in my junior year was because I was like, shit, I got to come up with a fucking science experiment.

What am I going to do?

So I went through the neighborhood at fucking midnight and I went and went and found flowers

and I was like, okay, let me grab three different...

Dig up three different flowers.

One that's fully healthy, one that's kind of like dying and one that's dead.

And I took them.

I went back to my house.

I took three plastic cups.

I put water in them.

I took water from the sink.

I took water from outside that had like dirt in it.

And another one I put like I think a drop of food coloring or something like that.

Plopped that shit in there.

And didn't even cut out paper.

I cut out some paper.

Wrote what happens to plants if you...

Different types of water or bullshit.

Or I think I put like bleach in the dead one or something like that.

And was like, well, with healthy water and sunlight, it helps...

It's growing well.

With, you know, water that's not cleaned and doesn't have sunlight, it starts to die.

And with chemical agent, it's dead within...

All within a six-week or three-week period or some bullshit.

And I got a C.

Or a D, I think.

I got a D.

Did that shit 20 minutes before school started.

I had six months to do a project.

And I had so many good ideas.

You know what I mean?

Like it just...

And it's...

You know, I need to do it.

I need to take care of these things.

And I...

The problem is that I have to remember to hire somebody or get somebody to help me remember.

But I keep forgetting to get somebody to help me to remember.

And it's just a pain in the ass.

And it's like...

It's one of those things where it's like, oh, I'll do it on my own.

Or, oh, it's not worth it.

Or this.

And it's a problem, you know?

It's a problem.

I'm not trying to like, oh, feel bad for me kind of thing.

But like I'm not in the game.

I wasn't in the GameStop movie or documentary because I didn't respond to an email.

Are you raising your kids to be ADHD aware as well?

I think the thing that's going to help...

My daughter has it way more than my son.

Like my son is way more Indian than...

He's more of that side.

My daughter has it.

But what I'm trying to do is try to help her learn to focus her energy instead of like I was.

I didn't have any stimulation as a kid.

Like my grandfather said that one time he went to go pick me up from my mom.

And she was...

She was out doing her work.

And I was just sitting there.

And she had thrown a bunch of Cheerios on the floor or whatever it was for me to eat.

And I was doing that.

And he took me out to McDonald's or someplace.

And he gave me like a little game.

And he said I attacked it.

Like it was stimulation.

It was the only stimulation I had had in a long time.

And I didn't have anybody to help me bottle that energy.

It's kind of like when you go to the Tesla ball or whatever they call it with all those little like electric lines are.

And you put your hand somewhere and it all goes.

That's how I am.

Except mine is on like finance, economics, and that bullshit.

But if I don't have that, I'm just everywhere.

So I'm trying to teach her how to like focus on one thing at a time which isn't working.

But is it genetic or developed?

I think it's genetic.

I just don't...

I think that we've misunderstood what these things are because everything has become such a cliche and such a fucking fad that like people don't know.

Like, oh, my God.

I totally forgot to pick that up.

I got ADHD so bad.

Oh, my God.

I'm like so hyper right now.

I have like ADHD like the worst way.

It's like, fuck you, Becky.

You don't have ADHD.

You have...

You're an annoying bitch.

That's what you have.

All right?

Shut the fuck up.

All right?

Don't fucking minimize the shit that I go through every day because you want to get a fucking Adderall prescription.

Okay?

Just go to a dealer like everybody else.

You fucking...

Sorry.

I'm blacking out here.

Oh, my God.

I just can't.

What?

I...

Like my whole day was ruined because like I went in my closet and I put a blue shirt where a black shirt was going to go.

And I just like...

I have like such OCD.

Like, it's just OCD.

That's not what...

Motherfucker, people with OCD are out here fucking barely...

That's not what that means.

Who told you that?

Who told you that's what OCD is?

You like things organized.

Cool.

That's not a fucking mental condition, you fucking...

Like, I understand that something bothers you.

Like, I'm the opposite.

I will walk by a rapper on the ground for six months saying, you know what?

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

And I'll pick that up next time I come through.

And I'll say that every day for six months.

And people are like, how do you not just fucking pick up the rapper off the floor?

How do you just walk over it?

I'll get it on the way back.

Somewhere else mentally.

I'll get it on...

And do that with all your shit.

You know what I mean?

Are you beefing with Becky?

No.

Right?

And it's not...

And you know what?

I'm not laughing about it.

I hate that about myself.

I was clearing off my desk yesterday.

I take the opportunity to laugh about it.

Like, I would have been better off talking to her.

Yeah.

take the mail from my mailbox, which I only check every two weeks. Cause I forget. And I'd say,

I'll do it tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. And then I put it on my desk. It was that big of a pile.

I found a fucking, uh, uh, class action lawsuit that I was supposed to get money for from a stock

and I never filed for it. You know, and I hate it. I hate it. It bothers me. It bothers me.

I, I have to, I have a, I have a calendar on the wall that my wife got me. Okay. I got a fucking

calendar on the wall that my wife got me to help me remember shit. May, 2024. So what I have,

what I have to do is, is I have to legitimately put fucking sticky notes on my bathroom mirror

for things I have to do in a day. And I'm not happy with it. I'm not proud of it. I fucking

hate it, but it's the only way I could do it. I had to, I used to have to have whiteboards

on the fridge and the front door of the house. If I needed to do something and I remembered in that

moment to do it, I had to write it down because if you don't do something, you remember, you

have to do in the moment you think about it, it will never get done. All right. My bad. I'm, I'm,

I'm going on a tangent here. Um, we ride having a little bit of move here. SGBX moving GPUS at a

great day. MNTS is up a bit. I don't have a lot of time today. Cause I got to take bail to the,

um, we got to take him to his oncologist appointment. I got a fucking pit in my stomach.

It all comes down to whether he has T or B cells for his lymphoma and what the treatment is going

to look like. Like there's a part of you in the back of your head. You're like, maybe you might

know, you know? All right. Um, Oh, time to pick up a couple of shares. It's under 60 bucks again.

When I got diagnosed, my parents said it wasn't true. And I was just a brat.

I think people misunderstand like, you know, kids being hyper and kids being, you know,

all over the place is normal being kids. We were so quick to diagnose shit. You know what I mean?

Like we're so quick to diagnose shit and we go to one person and we just say, Oh, okay. That's it.

Like, my thing is, is I'm like, they're fucking, they're, they're kids, man. Like, like, let them

be kids. And if like,

my daughter even came to me the other day and she's like, dad, she goes, daddy, she goes,

I can't, uh, I'm not what she says. What does focused mean? I said, well, it means paying

attention. She goes, I'm not focused. She goes, this one girl, she, no matter whenever we do

classwork, she's always focused. She goes, when I'm doing it, if I hear something, I look and go

look for it and see what it is. And then I come back and I hear another noise or somebody say

something or something happened and I go look for it. I can't do, I can't do focused. And I'm

thinking to myself, I want to say, I get it kid, but it doesn't work. I can't do focused. And I'm

at the same time. She's still a kid. You know what I mean? My fucking daughter, my daughter is

four years old, about to turn five years old. She can explain evaporation and the precipitate

precipitation cycle, but can't draw a phone. We can't write a fucking J what the fuck Nokia

halted pending news. Oh, Oh shit. Let's go jet blue. She's like me. Like there's actual news

today that China is now requiring influencers who talk about serious topics to have a

degree. This is true. Okay. This might make a good whiteboard for Tik TOK or some shit. So let

me actually tell you guys what's going on. Okay. So Nokia opening with a open AI and just get the

pump and don't. All right. So here you go. Oh fuck. I've already forgot. I went on the fucking

Sesame street, Mickey mouse, fucking word of the day shit that ended up in some weird fucking

tune porn. But my bad for those of you guys who weren't here, probably a good thing. So China.

Okay.

China is, is, is basically saying that, uh, you know, you, uh, you, you know, you're, you're either

spreading misinformation or whether you're qualified to talk about something. Now, some people will say

this is good. Some people won't, but regardless in China, influencers, I hate this word now

required. Okay. Now again, this is, this everyone's going to have whatever, but they're going to have

a university degree, not just any diploma to talk about serious topics. That is right. Ladies and

gentlemen in China, if you were an influencer, you are now required to have a university degree

before talking about serious topics, or you will face a fine of 100,001. So if you, uh,

are in China and you're reading about this, uh, you can't drop out of school to become an

influencer. Okay. Now all jokes aside, there are two sides to this coin. Oh, here goes stocky with

his two sides fence sitting bullshit. No, I want you to hear about this. You're probably saying

yourself. Good. We need that here in America. I get your point. I get your point. Shouldn't have

17, 18 year olds out there talking about economic policy and, and, and, and shouldn't be out there

talking about, you know, being able to do it, but is that on them or is that on the audience watching?

Okay. Here's the truth. That's not on the influencer. That's on you. If you're getting

your fucking financial advice, financial knowledge, or your fucking political take

from a goddamn 18 year old kid or some 27 year old fucking unemployed guy that's fucking on

YouTube or streaming or some shit. What are you doing? What are you trying to, you're trying to

fix the problem of people's stupidity by, by, by saying that the people that are giving the, the,

the, the information are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are,

the problem. Now, I understand why people are big on this. Hey, you should be qualified before you

can speak on something. Sure, if someone's backing you, but if you're just a person speaking,

right, your mind, you shouldn't have, there shouldn't be a, of course, China is different.

A lot of people are big on this. They like the idea of government control of people's speech

and people's things. And in America, we're a little bit different. But the idea that this

is how you stop speech, right? The government is telling you that unless you have a government

funded school's degree, you cannot speak on serious topics. Some people will say this is

good. This will stop disinformation or disinformation. This will stop people from

taking the wrong knowledge. But it's also a way of basically saying that there can't be

any dissenting views, right? You may not think a 17-year-old is not,

is not qualified to talk about the economic state of the world or the country, okay?

But you should stop them from talking about it. If anything, the people who listen to a 17-year-old

about it are probably the ones that should be more concerned about. But if you think that a

government funded college and people who get degrees from a government funded college are

the only ones that should be allowed to talk about serious topics, no one's thinking about

it that way. They're only thinking, good, no more fucking 17-year-old TikTokers,

trying to tell us the state of the economy or what's good or bad about gun control or birth

decisions and abortion or drugs or anything like that, women's rights, men's rights, minorities.

Again, I think we're looking at it wrong. I think everybody just wants somebody to fix

everything for them. Nobody wants to do the work for themselves. Nobody wants to take accountability.

Also, in America, I want you to think about,

this. I am not an authority on anything. I know a few things, and I remember them, and I repeat

them. I don't have a college degree. Matter of fact, I didn't get any type of degree until I was

already streaming, and I was in my 30s, and that was an AS degree, an associate's degree,

and that was in criminal justice. So if somebody who's 22 and just got a degree from some fucking

college in economics, which they probably learned in an outdated book from a professor that's been

teaching the same shit over and over again for 20 years, and that's their understanding of the

economy and not what's actually going on, I would say, as dumb as I am, I probably am more of an

authority on the current state of the economy than what they learned in their 20-year-old

textbook or their 10-year-old textbooks from their 20-year tenured professor, right? People will say,

you don't have a degree in economics. How can you talk on this? Same reason you bring your car to

one, you know, down the street who's been working on cars for 25 years, even though he didn't get a

fucking degree from the goddamn Auto Institute of America. He's never worked at fucking Midas,

Advanced Auto Parts, AutoZone. He never worked at fucking, you know, Tire Kingdom. But son of a

bitch been working on cars since he was 12 years old, you figure he probably knows, right? Like,

it's kind of the same way. I'm not nearly that good. I'm an idiot, but like, it's the same kind

of thing, right? When somebody's immersed in something on a day-to-day basis, right,

it kind of...

It helps. And so, again, I understand why some people think this is a good thing because they're

trying to think all roses and sunshine and how this is a positive thing to stop, you know,

people that are unqualified for giving information out there. But you're very slippery slope. And I

know people don't like the slippery slope, Logan, but I think it's very important to remember that

because you're talking about the government controlling who gets to say what, right?

The same people who are talking about how much Trump and what he's doing with

the press right now, which is egregious in my opinion. He's trying to silence the press

and we'll go nuts about that. We'll praise this. And I'm like, no, just because it's China or just

because it's influencers or whatever, you've got to hold them to the same accountability. You don't

want the government controlling speech. Well, it's different. If the president says that the

press can't ask certain questions or be in the room, that's different than the government trying

to make a stop spread of misinformation and shit like that. The government trying to stop

spreading information. You think that's what's happening? No,

this is the same shit. Same shit. I don't want our president fucking stopping any press from

having access because I don't care. If anything, I want people that aren't mainstream lockstep boot

press to cover things. That's why the mainstream media knows it's over for them.

They know it's over for them. They don't have a monopoly. They don't have the stranglehold anymore.

The people who still watch them are dying. The rise of the independent,

content creator is the key to real information. The problem is that there's going to be a lot of

misinformation in there. But wait a second. You think independent content creators are the ones

that invented misinformation? The legacy news literally has been doing that for a hundred years.

They literally are lock and step and bought and paid for.

They've been spreading a narrative misinformation for a hundred years.

At least now you have an option. The problem is, is people are too lazy to go fact check.

They're too lazy. They want to hear what somebody says and be like, hmm, that's true.

In April, the amount of people that came into the stream and told me the ports are empty

almost caused me to fucking have an aneurysm on stream. Stocky, the ports are empty.

And the moment I asked them,

why are you saying,

why are you saying that? They couldn't answer. They could not answer me. Oh, well, you know,

look at the tracker on this. Okay. I can see the live tracker. There's definitely a significant

decrease in traffic coming in, but that's not empty. Yeah, but it's down like 70% in the past

two weeks. Yes, that's true. That's not empty. And it's only on the West coast, not on the East

coast. Okay. All right. But Hey, listen, maybe you're, maybe you're being hyperbolic, right?

Stocky, the store shelves will be empty in two weeks. Okay. What makes you say that?

What, what makes you say, why do you think the store shelves will be empty in two weeks?

No answer. Or because the ports are empty or whatever, or because China is, is no imports

coming from China. Okay. Chatter, how much of our food do we import from China?

Silence, silence. They don't know. That means they're just parroting something they heard from

some content creator, like 5%, less than 5% of our food. So even if the ports were empty for a week,

which they weren't, and I wasn't, I'm not trying to say, you know, Oh, everything that happened

was good. I hated the whole tariff thing. We get our food from Canada and Mexico. Why the fuck would

our store shelves be empty? But that's not, that's the idea is that people just want to hear what

right. If that content creator had a degree, they would know not to say that. I don't have a degree.

I saved it. I don't know who the content creators are. I don't ask where these people get their news

from. And it wasn't even me telling people you shouldn't be scared or concerned or worried about

the, how the tariffs are going to affect the economy and stuff like that. But this is just,

you know, this is just, this is, this is what I fight against every day. And, you know, I give

information. I give the, the, the, the analytical or the data information. I give my opinion on how

I think it's going to affect the economy. I give my opinion on how I think it's going to affect the

and stuff like that. But I encourage you guys to call me out on it if I'm wrong, right? Because

there's some times that I do give misinformation, not disinformation, misinformation accidentally.

And when I get called and I see it, I correct myself. If I don't see it, I go back and watch

my stream. And the main reason I go back and watch my stream is so I can make sure that I'm up to

date on it. Remember when I said that like 40% of, of Bitcoin is owned by like 30 wallets or 300

wallets or something like that. And people were like, no motherfucker, it's 3000 wallets. And I

was like, am I incorrect about that? And I looked it up and I was like, no, it's not. And I was like,

I looked it up on stream and I was incorrect. And I said, you know what guys, I was wrong. It's

3000 wallets. It's not 30 wallets. I was misremembering and thank you for bringing to my

attention. And then I got fucking flamed for it. So I will never admit when I'm wrong again,

you fucking pieces of shit. Wow. Five seconds where this guy doesn't cuss or make or insult

someone's mother. Tell your mom, I said, hi, and I miss her fat ass. Okay. Your dad's not coming

back, but at least every day there'll be a new guy at your house. You can pretend for 10 minutes

that he's your dad. As he says, Hey, keep your head up sport. Shut the fuck up. Loser. What

Nvidia $1 billion equity investment in Nokia. It's that's all it is. It's just, it's just a circle

jerk. It's just a money circle jerk right now. This company invests in this company and then

gives it right back to this company. Hey, jet blue starting to gap. It took a little while,

but we might've nailed that one. Spy fallen, but I think we're doing good. Why do people feel the

need to come into a streamer's stream and tell them how to stream? I don't know. I know you got

to run stocky, but appreciate the

SoFi signal earlier was not a signal, bro. This is not a signal service. How's SoFi doing? I don't

think we caught the bottom on it. Hey, stocky, I hate your stream, but how are you doing after

Friday? It was a really fucking rough weekend. Um, yeah, it went lower after that. Um, and, uh,

a lot of shit going on. A lot of, a lot of anxiety with the move and the stress right now. But

the last, the big thing is, is today we're about to leave in about five minutes

and it is, I have a pit in my stomach. We have to go see the cancer specialist to see

what we're going to do. Um, and I, you know what I mean? Especially considering that I'm driving

up with him on Sunday and we, I don't want us to have to make a decision, but it's, it's,

it's a pit in my stomach. It's a really fucking big pit in my stomach. All right. We got to get

out of here. All right, let's get out of here, guys. I got to go. Uh, we got a busy day and

important shit to go do. So let's do it. Industry Miolo. Okay. Let me see.

Hey buddy, where's your hot dog? I see your hot dog. Oh, good boy.

No, I wasn't. The whole point of what I said was not, Hey, I'm, I'm smarter than everybody else.

And I'm so good at this that I give you the right information that I'm better than those people. No,

I, I, I'm, I'm, I am, uh, uh, you know, just as guilty of, of, of, of, you know,

giving an opinion of something. And sometimes my opinion is wrong. Okay. I do that. It's never

intentional. And I try to give as, as, as straightforward and non-intentional,

unbiased of an answer or an analysis of something as possible, but I'm human.

I'm going to make mistakes, but I try, I try to make sure that I correct them.

But I also try to give you guys all the information and explain how things work

historically and how things work, you know, from a data standpoint and not how I do it based off of

my feelings or emotions. I mean, I'm just a guy on Twitch, man. I'm just a guy on Twitch

who likes numbers. What's your out on JetBlue? 1 million percent. I feel like I have to take

this stock because it's, it's, it's called R-E-C-T for wrecked, but they won't let me buy it,

which sounds like rectum or rectal. That poor dentist, because remember she wrote the thing

for the exam and she goes, uh, what day do you want me to schedule this for, uh, for this exam?

And I looked down, I said, rectal. And she, and I miss you. Yeah. I saw the Nokia news drop.

And the old lady, she laughed. She tried to stop the laugh, but she couldn't help it.

SMX.

Security matters. Publicly limited company down 99.9% year to date. 99.9% in the last six months.

There you go, buddy. There's your YOLO. Literally the definition of a YOLO. All right. I gotta go.

I gotta go. I gotta go. Um, somebody give me a name to raid. I got it. We got to go right now.

I got to go take him. I can't be able to wait to this appointment. Good plays today, Saki. These

aren't, this is, you better don't fucking shadow me. You dipshit. Although NNE did well. JetBlue

is gapping up. SoFi is doing good. Car took a little while. It's going.

Um, PayPal overnight was great. I don't know about this Visa call guys. I'm not a hundred

percent, uh, confident in Visa. Shit. We're up 9% of the day though. That's not bad. And I'm

going to, I'm going to keep all the, the, all my other capital, um, overnight in case we have a

pullback tomorrow for some reason. Why not Google for earnings? Because I own so many goddamn shares

of Google. It doesn't even matter at this point. Generally, I take a put on something. We took

calls on Google. Remember last time I said, I think Google is going to end up about 6% after

hours. And that was just a wild guess. And they ended up 6% after hours. And that was insane

because of how big their market cap was. Uh, I almost want to take a Google put to hedge my

shares because if it does go up, I lose a couple hundred bucks on a put, but I make so much on the,

on the, on the shares. But if it does fall, I can make money on the puts and then buy the dip on

shares. But I think I'm going to just, just sit this one out today. I'm going to see how I feel

after this, uh, this appointment with Bayo. I'm, I really need to, I need to have my head right.

Um, and, and, and, and, and, you know, go do this because that's our, that's,

this is a tough one. Um, it's a tough one. And like I said, anybody who, especially he's so

young, he's only seven and the kids, my daughter has been so fucking loving to him the last week

too. She's like had this new thing where she's like, he's my best friend and I love him so much.

He's my baby. And she's been putting like hair ties on him. And she's just been talking about

it and talking about telling him how they're going to build a snowman together in Delaware.

And I'm like, you know what I mean? Like, how are you going to break it to her? I've,

my daughter and I talk very, very frankly about things. And we're very, you know,

but I have to, I have to decide. I'm not, I don't want to talk about it right now. I don't

want to talk about it right now. I just want to go one thing at a time. I want to go deal with this.

Somebody give me a name. I have to leave right now, please. I've always, I've always talked to

my, my, my daughter, like, like, like, uh, like, like, like an adult, you know what I mean? Not

like directly, like get out of the fucking house, get a job, pay taxes, you fucking freeloader. But

like, you know, in a kid way, but adult things, sips, please don't tell me that's some kind of

like alcoholic. Oh no, this is, he has a lot of viewers. I need somebody who's a very small

streamer. Scott's arcade.

Okay, fine. I have to go. I don't have, I can't, I can't even, um, I can't even joke. I have to go

right now. All right. Um, I'm going to ask for a raid. I don't have time. All right, let's go guys.

I'll give you guys an update depending on how good or bad the, the, the, the, the, the treatment

plan and everything is. Um, I'll give you guys an update. I'll be streaming tomorrow. Um, we have

the FOMC decision tomorrow, so I have to be here. Um, I forgot what the yellow is. All right, let's

go. Let's get naked and get out of here. Get your shirts off. Let's get our titties out for Bayo.

Um,

all right, let's go. All right, guys, remember, become an organ donor. It's the greatest gift you

can give. It doesn't cost you anything. That's number one. Number two, if there's somebody you

love, somebody you miss, you've been talking about, give them a call, give them a text, send them an

email, send them a carrier pigeon, let them know you're thinking about them. You can really make

somebody's day, but more importantly, go make your own day. You got the rest of it. Make the

best of it. Remember, as long as you got two healthy kidneys, you are not broke. Otherwise,

I will see you guys tomorrow. Hasta mañana. Hasta luego. Mi amigos, mi familia, cabrones,

venteros y todo. Gracias por todo. To my lurkers, I know you are out there. You are the backbone of

this channel. Thank you so much for being here each and every day.

And to everybody who gifted, subbed, donated, gave bids, followed, whatever. You guys are

absolutely insane simps. I don't know why you do it, but I appreciate you. And to every single

one of you, thanks for being here every day. Let me keep you company doing whatever it is

you do each and every day. And, you know, let me do this as a job for some reason. And as long as

you keep coming, I'm going to keep coming too, okay? I'll see you guys tomorrow. Go fuck yourselves.

Tell your mom I said hi. She got a fat ass. And as always, as always, stay green, you DJ. Bye.

Tell your mom I got an organ.

Donate to her.
