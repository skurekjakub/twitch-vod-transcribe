Well, good

Frickin morning you DJs. That's right

We're doing this show in our underwear today. Let's go. All right. Well, we nailed it on lending club last night

Netflix puts the day before and what was the one before that?

Whatever we're three for three on earnings plays this week. At least you sold IBIO at 185

What a hell of a place the past two days. I'm not in it anymore

SPG X went nuts after hours. I was surprised. I was like, oh, there's my squeeze

thoughts on the CS to market crash

What the fuck is the CS to market crash?

All right, let's go my bad. I'm muted as always. Okay. All right. So let's see how we do this morning

We got a lot of things pop it off. So we're gonna take a look or get it rid of our lending club calls

I am in Ophel

VC and QS

Also looking at moh once I get out of lending club here. Oh shit. I'm up. Whoa. Why am I up so much? Oh

Lending club. Okay. Yeah, yeah lending club. Oh

All right, we're over a hundred percent

161 percent on these so we're gonna go ahead and sell right here

Because I like to sell early. I'm not still muted. All right, I'm gonna sell my

Lending club calls here

Actually, I'm gonna sell them a little bit early because that's what I do. I'm just gonna sell them for 105 percent

And then I'm gonna get moh calls

Open for a bounce there. All right, Ophel

VC I'm playing a little degen want to QS actually by average a little bit

Lower than this but playing this right here because I want to um, all right, we got some movers. Oh, all right

So let's take a look here. We've got an any of 4%

We got Google always up bit one of sgbx went wild after hours

Went back into SHMD this morning guilt up. We rides up 2% We got NBX up a little bit here

TSS I up we've added to that yesterday

STSS is up pretty decent

We'll see if there's a bounce back today. I'm gonna add some more QS shares if it goes down

All right out of lending club now

moh, I want to wait for moh

IV to die down a little bit

Because it's way too expensive right now. All right, go away here. You sold in vcig. No, I've been out of that for a while

All right, Ophel's a fun one there VC

I'm playing this because of them paying down five million dollars in debt and I'm playing QS because I think quantum's gonna have a good

Day plus they have a catalyst. So waiting for a little bit lower of an entry here. If I jump in again

I want to grab it if it goes under 14 here

QS has nothing to do with quantum. Okay. Well, thank you for your

They get filled on moh or not. Let me guess right

It's in the sector is what I'm watching

But but they have that they actually have a catalyst and because their name is quantum if Trump's announcement has to do with quantum

He's gonna pour it force this up

Remember I'm a cowboy trader. Okay, I do my thing

Alright, I took one moh call because I have a feeling that there's a chances might come back down again

So I want to make sure that I'm only legging in

you want to pop in and say thank you for the thick raid last night usually it's a

woman coming in thanking me for something sick the night before but yeah

man hey yo appreciate you in hope you hope you had fun with these guys they're

they're nice they can be what moh calls you're looking at I picked up the $200

calls for next year I think for March I got it for 950 quantum in the name is

better than actually doing stuff with the quantum in the market again I I

trade my way I don't recommend it it's not it's not a way for everybody trust

me it's probably not way for most people that anybody who has intelligence but I

follow with the I follow with the the way the retail market works and stuff

like that and so here's the thing last night admit Trump administration says

that they're considering taking stakes in quantum now just like they went from

Intel to rare earth to quantum okay that's number one

you

number two Trump says he's doing an announcement today at three number three

massive sell-off the last two days which could continue in this in the momentum

and growth and specular stocks but if it does have a bounce back today as three

and then on top of that QS came out and said that they signaled a 12-month cash

runway extension and 12.8 million dollars in q3 customer billings so you

give me all those catalysts quantum in the name retail doesn't care it's one of

those ones that has all the recipes for a pop today doesn't mean it will

but it has the recipes for the pop just me just me you know it's each their own

you know I don't I'm not I'm not here to tell people what to do and how to do it

why mo H um health care has been beaten up and has had a big comeback we've been

playing cure which is the 3x leveraged health care ETF as well as buying UNH at

227 and Oscar down at the bottom whatnot and they lowered their guidance on their

earnings pretty bad

there'll be about a quarter of that to reattach their earnings at this time

however a lot of people still have fomo in the health care sector because they

didn't time the bottom on it oh or didn't get in on the big dip and so it

gives that opportunity over the next couple weeks for it to be a fomo by and

also we got new news this morning as well for health insurance and health

care companies where it's the average oh's it we talked about during a call

this morning um let me just go to my notes here from this morning

ah

Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua Hua

Cremiums rose to an average of $27,000 this year.

Now, it's probably better to play.

Thanks for QS under 14.

Stocky paid rent with weeklies.

Wait, what?

You son of a bitch.

I got filled too, though.

Thoughts on the Beyond short squeeze?

Do you think the short's cleared yesterday?

I took puts on it two days ago

and then added towards the end of the day two days ago.

And I sold for 20% yesterday.

I'm afraid to look at what they are today.

This guy said here, what day was this?

Yeah, he said that your puts are cooked.

I actually took puts here

and then I added at the end of the day.

Overnight, it went nuts.

IV came up and then I sold for 25% on the dip.

And right now, I'm afraid to look at it.

Why am I up so goddamn much today?

I know lending calls did really well for earnings,

but what else is going on?

Look at Kaki.

Anal said that Kaki was going to zero.

We made a bunch on this.

Look at that.

We bought all the way down and he said Kaki going to zero.

And he said that at the bottom.

And it's up almost 100% now.

Full gap in this year.

Why do you play puts instead of shorting?

The problem with puts is you're going to overpay a lot of them

because of the premium when it's like that.

But at the same time, you know your max loss.

You know what I mean?

If you're wrong.

That's why I like it.

All right.

QS doing really nice.

Why are we up so much?

What is going on today?

What quantum stock are you in?

I'm not even in a quantum stock.

I'm in quantum skate.

All right.

SGBX was the one that we've been holding for a while.

I'm still holding some of it.

I'm up 65% on it.

We got into...

If you want to play a real quantum stock,

obviously, you're going to want to play RGTI or QBTS or something like that.

I'm playing this off of an actual monetary catalyst

as well as...

The fact they have quantum in their name,

which I know sounds stupid,

but I've done dumber things.

And so that's why I'm playing that one.

To each their own, though.

But SGBX is the one that we play.

Remember that one that we took as an end-of-day YOLO the other day

because it was called Safe and Green?

It made like 5%.

Then the next day, it dropped like 45%.

So I played it that.

I bought it, and I just kept it.

And because the cost to borrow is like 600%.

It's insane.

And so I was like,

all right, let me see if this has a squeeze or not.

And sure as shit, last night and this morning,

this is the day we played it,

and then it popped up.

And then yesterday, it went from 209 to 4.

It went 121% after hours.

All right, so if I bounce it back.

So I got to find out what's going on.

Why are we up so much?

What is moving so much this morning?

All right, we added to Joby yesterday.

They're doing good today.

Helen of Troy making a real comeback.

So wait on IMRX.

And then we went back into Flowers yesterday at the end of the day.

That's up 8%.

So let's go ahead.

We can put a trillion stop loss on that.

Fucking people from Schwab reached out,

and they're like,

hi, we just want to know if you utilize TOS.

And if you do, we'd like to talk to you about,

or if you don't, we'd like to talk to you about

getting you set up on Thinkorswim.

And I said, I'm actually going to be quitting your fucking platform, bro.

I said, it's not your fault,

but just letting you know, like, legitimately,

every time I put in an order on this,

it diverts it to 1%.

And I can't trade like that.

All right, we went back.

We went back into NVX yesterday, too.

We're seeing some movement on that.

Damn, everything is green.

What the fuck?

SGBTX, we're up 42%.

QS, 8%.

Flowers, 7%.

NVX, 6%.

Ophel, we're in.

WeRide's up 5%.

MNTS is up 3%.

NNE's up 3%.

Next is up 3%.

EBS is up 3%.

Guilt is up almost 2.5%.

TSSI is up 2%.

Bought some more of that yesterday, too.

STSS, SoFi.

Celsius back at 62%.

Celsius was a good call yesterday.

Oh, by the way, did you guys,

those of you guys that got the D,

pro dip with me yesterday

when it went to 750?

That was a fucking banger of a play yesterday.

We grabbed that shit.

It went down to 755.

I got it at 759.

Trailing stop loss defaults to points

as a change of percentage.

I literally put it on percentage.

I go to trailing stop loss,

how many shares.

I change from dollar to percentage.

I put in negative 6 or 7.

Enter.

And then it automatically puts in the order

for negative 1%.

And sometimes I have to change it

three or four times or cancel it.

And then by then, it does it.

It just pisses me off.

All right, let's get back to it.

All right.

I keep forgetting.

Oh, did anybody get the mirror dip yesterday?

Beyond is going to go beyond orbit.

Pump it up.

Bro, I got bad news for you.

If you come into this community

trying to pump your stocks,

it ain't going to work, man.

I'm sorry.

I've seen it over and over again.

It just, this ain't the one, man.

This ain't the one.

All right, QS looking good now.

Where we at on this?

All right.

Up about 1%.

So I'm going to go ahead

and start putting stop losses in.

Oh, I got so much fucking anxiety

over this goddamn move.

There it goes again.

Same thing.

I put it in for 6%.

It goes to 1%.

Nope.

Edit.

Do it again.

Nope.

Percent.

Five.

There we go.

So three times.

Oh, music.

Sorry.

My bad.

My bad.

My bad.

Did you buy the MLGO dip?

No.

I was putting,

I decided to use the dip yesterday

into things that I'm not de-jetting

as much as I'm trying to.

All right.

I got stopped out of VC.

I'm going to run it again.

I hate SPACs,

but I'm going to play it anyway.

Music's too loud.

Oh, shit.

My bad.

Yeah, TS Mobile works.

It's just a desktop.

Thoughts on buying 90 to 180 data,

especially Netflix calls?

I would really wait.

I mean, not wait,

but I'm really curious to see

about this Warner Brothers deal

and who's going to pick it up.

Oh, shit.

QS is running.

Let's go.

I'm unconventional.

I'm unconventional,

but sometimes it works.

Are we in a bear market

or bull market?

Are we in a bear market?

Are we in a bear market?

Are we in a bear market?

Opinion.

It's not an opinion.

We're in a bull market.

That's not an opinion.

That's just, that's just,

that's just what we are in.

In order to be a bear market,

you would have to be 20% down

from the recent high.

And yesterday,

at its bottom,

we were only down,

oh, sorry.

That's not SPY.

1.6%.

So, this is a bear market here.

Let me show you.

Guys, be nice.

He's actually asking.

He's not being a dick.

He's actually asking.

I know we get a lot of people in here

that are just dickheads,

but this person's not that,

ooh, nice.

Fucking nailed that bottom.

There you go.

To that person who asked that,

you're, you're, you're,

it's fine.

You're not, don't, don't,

don't get, don't get offended.

These guys are just used to people

being assholes all the time.

He's actually asking a question.

So, here you go.

Here's an example of a bull market.

So, or a bear market.

So, technically,

we hit a bear market in April, right?

Because once we went down 20%,

okay,

now it's, now it is like 25%.

We hit a bear market,

but then immediately into a bull market, right?

So, it depends on how you want to define it.

Like, down a certain amount

from a certain percentage

or for a certain number,

technically is a bull,

is a bear market,

but some people will say

if it's down that much

and it's lasted a certain amount of time, okay?

The last real bear market we had was 2022.

And that was when the Fed

finally started raising rates

and everybody started figuring out

that this was going to be a bigger problem.

And then we ended up going down

as much as 27%

and we didn't actually,

we didn't actually break even

for,

it was almost two years until,

or I'm sorry,

almost two years till we broke even.

And that's why when people say,

but what if the market falls?

Okay, it'll go back up.

Well, what if it doesn't go back up?

Well, you got bigger things to worry about

your 401k.

Well, what if it's like Japan?

We're not fucking Japan.

Stop, stop making that comparison.

Well, what if it doesn't come back up

for seven years like it did in 2008?

And I think to myself,

you telling me I get to buy the dip,

dollar cost average,

the dip for seven straight years,

fucking bring it on.

So a lot of it's about perspective, right?

If you have a 401k,

you're not worried about market fluctuations

because you're worried about the economy

and losing a job

and having to sell your equities

to live your lifestyle.

If anything, you should be wanting these

because number one,

it means the more dips you have now,

the less you have down the line

when you actually need the money.

But more importantly,

you get to buy the dips.

It's all about a mindset.

That's why people come in.

They're like,

you're just a perpetual bull stock here.

You don't fucking,

get it.

You just don't understand.

It's like, do.

The market's always going to go back up

until it doesn't.

And then I don't have to worry about my 401k

because there's bigger problems.

And, you know, I'm 40.

I still got time, plenty of time.

And, you know, if we crash,

if we want to call it a crash,

or we drop 40%,

I'm like, fuck yeah, let's go.

Because that means I get to fucking buy that dip.

Imagine how many people wish

they were dollar cost averaging

the hell out of 2022, right?

My channel took a big hit during that time

because a lot of people

just didn't want to look at their portfolios

or think about the stock market.

And I'm like, okay, that's cool.

But before you go,

make sure you have your dollar cost average

and buy this dip.

And it was just buying, buying, buying,

buying, buying, buying.

Two years of buying the dip.

And even from the top,

you know, even if you weren't buying the dip,

even from the top,

you're still up 50% in three years, right?

Four years, whatever.

50%.

That's over 10% a year average.

But if you dollar cost averaged

that entire time and halfway through,

instead, you have twice,

twice as much money

and you're up 65%, 70%.

So you've got twice as much money up even more.

And so that's the mindset.

Is this type of growth sustainable

even with the downward corrections?

Again, you know, if you look at the S&P 500,

the S&P 500 is actually red on the year.

Well, it's break even on the year

because it's up 13% of the year,

but the dollar's lost 13%.

So it's actually flat

if you look at it from that perspective, right?

Because people are piling in

as an alternative to losing the value of the dollar.

So you're seeing market go up.

I'm seeing flat.

Now, if the dollar was down 4%

and this was up 25%,

then I'd say, okay,

now we're getting, you know, outpacing it, right?

I'll give you an example, okay?

Actually, you know what?

Fuck it.

Let me give you a graph, okay?

Okay.

Now, take this

and look at the stock market in that timeframe, okay?

If you just flip that

and put the stock market chart on it,

it looks exactly the same.

Well, not exactly, but pretty close.

More so now,

just because there's more people in the market, right?

There's just more people in the market now

and there's more money going into it.

So it's pumping even higher.

Just remember,

the value of something is not what you think it's worth.

It's what people are willing to pay for it, okay?

A great example,

since I have to use these examples

because it's the only way people listen.

Why is it that a girl you think is a 10 out of 10

who does OnlyFans gets 200 bucks a month,

but some girl you're like,

what the fuck is making 50,000 a month?

Right?

Because value is what someone's willing to pay for.

Oh, it's not worth seeing that person's nudes

for that much money.

Not to you.

But there's people out there that it is

and they're willing to pay for it.

Okay?

I'm sorry.

I cannot get that dude's titties out of my brain right now.

It's all I can see.

I'm trying to think 10 years ago

that I would be using this as an analogy.

Boy, have times changed.

This is tame compared to 2035, probably.

Then we'll be talking about sex robots.

Dark place on the internet if you're looking for porn.

Oops, I'm sorry.

I didn't say that out loud.

Is Lumen a long hold?

I bought 1,000 shares of Lumen

when it was $1.04 in my Chase account.

And then it went 1,000% in like three months.

And I was like, oh shit.

So I sold half of it.

And I still have 500 shares left.

And I'm still up 650% on it.

So I'm just kind of like chilling.

You know what I mean?

Oh shit.

SHMD we went back into this morning.

Okay.

Okay.

I took a lending call clubs,

lending call clubs,

lending call,

lending club calls last night

because I was thinking to myself,

so many people are delinquent on debt right now

that they're having to look for alternatives

and private debt.

And I was like, you know,

the defaults haven't happened yet.

So lending club probably has

pretty decent customer acquisition

and revenue right now

because the defaults haven't happened.

So that's why I took calls last night.

Okay.

I probably sold to,

let me see.

We're three for three for earnings this week.

Two calls and one put.

Is the market becoming unstable

with the amount of short squeeze

increasing dramatically as of late?

No, it just means people have too much fucking money.

Just means there's a lot of money on the sidelines.

11, 21, $17 calls.

What did I sell them for?

230.

They're 280 now.

God damn it.

What channels did you discuss the earnings in?

I missed it.

I don't discuss earnings in there.

It's not necessarily discuss.

I just, people just say,

you know,

what are you thinking about doing?

And this, whatever.

It's just, you know.

So what I said was is,

I said, I'm taking lending club calls.

And then apparently some guy asked me

if I would do with something weird.

I said, everyone is in debt.

I assume they're getting a piece of it.

So I'm taking November 17 calls.

That's just, I don't,

I don't tell people what to do.

I don't like to talk about too much

because there are people in here

that don't understand how these things work

and they'll follow me into it

and they'll get wrecked

because they'll take some short dated option

or it'll,

they'll go the wrong way

and they'll over leverage.

So I don't, I really,

I know it's not my,

it's not my,

my responsibility to make sure

people don't do stupid shit,

but I still feel that way.

Like I, if you,

I know that people will.

So therefore I've just, you know,

you know, I just,

I feel like it's the right thing to do

to be careful about that stuff.

But I'm telling you right now,

some of y'all are going to make some real money

if you know what to do here pretty soon

in the short term,

in the beginning.

If, if,

if the SEC approves pre-market options trading,

and right,

and 15 minute aftermarket options trading,

some of you guys are,

if you're smart,

you're going to be very,

do very well.

Okay?

Because there's a lot of idiots out there

and they don't know what they're doing.

So what you're going to be able to do is,

is buy something the night before,

early morning at a low valuation.

And then as we get a little bit later in the morning,

when people start waking up,

you're going to be able to put a sell order

at a high end on the ask bid spread.

And somebody,

some new guy's going to come in

and want to buy,

and he's going to hit the fucking market order pre-market

and get fucking crushed.

He's going to get crushed.

Also,

those of you guys that like to sell options,

those premiums are going to go higher

because you've got more people coming in pre-market after hour,

especially after earnings.

My favorite thing is going to be

if I have an earnings play

and it falls,

you know,

25%,

I love to buy shares on that

and wait for the bounce.

But instead,

I'll be able to sell calls

or,

or,

or,

or,

you know,

buy the,

the,

the opposite direction really cheap

and then see what happens.

I don't know.

It's more so about making money off of people.

I'm not saying you should,

smart how,

how do you have to buy a DVD for five easy payments?

Earnings is going to be insane.

I'm not saying you should exploit people.

That's not what I'm saying.

I'm saying there is a system in place

that you can utilize

that people who don't know what they're doing

will have to learn the hard way like you did.

Okay?

You're not exploiting people.

You're not exploiting anybody.

If I buy shares of QS right now at 1487

and I put a sell order for 1550

and I walk away

and it comes back

and some asshole hit market order

and I have the only thing available

and he overpays for that,

did I exploit somebody?

No,

I didn't go tell that person

you should buy it from me here

and you're going to make a lot of money.

That's exploiting.

I just put it out there.

It's like fishing, right?

No, nevermind.

I don't want the blurb.

Nevermind.

I'm not going to say you should throw a hook out there.

You know,

it is what it is.

You know what I'm saying?

Like you're not doing anything.

You're not telling anybody anything.

You're not convincing anybody anything.

You just put it out there for a sell.

You know?

If you put your house up for sale

and the Zillow value is 600,000

and you put it up for 650

and somebody walks up and says,

hey, I'd like to buy it from you for cash for 650.

What do you do?

That's just the market.

Okay?

It's a lot different

if you are promising somebody

or exploiting somebody.

That's the difference.

After that,

you post QS as a buy.

Yeah,

something like that.

That's manipulation.

Holy shit.

That was a good buy.

Yes, let's go.

Let's go, baby.

What a fucking pick up there.

Back to 69.

I'm up 12% now.

Second go around.

Well,

my other shares didn't fill.

So that's cool.

I'll just put the rest of these

at a 5% showing stop loss.

I bought 10 GE Verona

at the bottom of the dip yesterday.

Could I have done better

if I got options?

I know a little about doing options.

Probably not.

And the reason is

is because

yesterday the premiums were so high

that you might have got IV crushed.

Right?

So in other words,

it's so volatile.

It's so volatile

that it's really expensive to buy it

and you're going to overpay for it.

And then it has to continue

that movement significantly

for it to continue up.

If it starts to cool off,

you're going to start losing value

even if the stock is going up.

I don't play a lot of options.

It seems like I do

because you hear me talking

about these things.

But my options portfolio

is very small

compared to my trading portfolio

with stocks.

And I only use options

as like a leverage, right?

So for example,

I bought one MOH call, right?

So instead of buying $10,000

worth of MOH

and giving myself

a 5% trailing stop loss

or a 7% trailing stop loss,

meaning that my max loss on this

is $700, whatever,

over a period of time,

I just said,

okay, here's what I'm going to do.

I'm going to buy one call,

okay, for that same price,

okay?

And if I lose that money,

it expires in March.

If I lose that amount of money,

I'm still at the same amount of money

I would have lost

if I held up $10,000 in shares

versus $900

or $800 in one option call, right?

And so I get to free up that capital

and still give myself that max loss.

And because I have so long to expires,

I can get out relatively cheap

because I don't have to let it go to max loss.

But so in other words,

I'm using this

because people say,

you're risking $10,000

to make $150.

No, no, I didn't.

I risked $400 or $100 or whatever,

whatever my stop loss is.

It's just that I don't have to tie up all,

not capital.

I could use that to buy something else.

How much money do you have?

Too much money.

Way too much money.

I am literally just dripping

in fucking money.

It's just insane.

That's not a body.

That's all my cash.

I just put it there

because it's the last place

anybody would look for it.

Okay?

I made 80% on lending call clubs.

Lending call, thanks.

It was not a fucking single.

$6,578 just for sub for 31 months.

Made 80% on LC, thanks, stocky.

Now your wife thinks you're rich.

My wife and I were going over

our fucking budget, man.

This fucking move is going to be expensive.

Great call on QS.

It's not a great call, bro.

It made some money and got lucky.

I still think it's going to go again.

If this thing falls back under $1,450,

I'm going to buy it again.

Is crypto worth it or not?

Worth it in what way?

What do you mean by is it worth it?

Is it worth the stress?

I don't know.

I don't know, man.

All right, come on, Helen of Troy.

Give me some more money.

Yes, but entry is everything.

Sound like my ex.

Ja Rule, appreciate the follow.

Or the sub.

Okay.

What was the other one

we wanted to look at after open?

M-O-H.

Oh, R.

How's R doing?

R did two different buybacks today.

Have you ever exercised an option?

Yes.

Yes, I have.

I normally don't like to do it

because I'd rather just have the money.

But I exercise,

actually exercise early once.

Oh, okay.

Oh, don't make me do this right now.

Don't make me do this right.

I'm going to have to buy this right now.

So will you have the Taylor Greene on the show?

I reached out to Marjorie Taylor Greene

because I figured if there's any Republican

that would come on my show,

it'd probably be her.

And I filled out all the,

I started filling it out

and then it was like,

I put the wrong one.

So I filled the whole thing out.

I got this one and submitted it

and I fucked up.

The A-talk guy,

twitch at gmail.com.

Bro trying to be Atriox so bad.

What the fuck does that even mean?

You don't see the,

you don't think they see the organization

and figure it out from there?

Either A, no, they don't.

Or B, they say,

this guy can't even fucking spell right.

He's probably like an Indian scammer.

No, we're not doing it.

It was a subconscious decision.

Don't fight it.

I love how you guys

will always be the people

who complain about problems

and then never, ever, ever

talk to people

you may or may not disagree with.

There's a problem

and I'm part of it.

By the way,

someone sent me all three

of the children's King Trump books

that this guy wrote.

Very weird conversation

I had to have with somebody in my house

of why those were in the kids' libraries.

Cash wrote books?

Yes, he did.

It's part of the reason he got

the plot against the King,

part one, two, and three.

And somebody sent them to me

as a joke.

But because it had a king on it,

my kids wanted to keep it around

even though we've never read it.

And it was in the kids' little library

and we had some neighbors over

with their kid trying to make friends

for our daughter.

And they were playing and stuff like that

and then they asked me,

oh, that's a really beautiful,

because I have a frozen Elsa Anna book thing.

Okay.

And I said, oh, that's really cute.

And I was like, yeah,

we got all kinds of books

and stuff like that.

And we were going through them,

pulling them out

and they saw the King

or something like that.

And they thought it was one of our

like fairy tale things

and pulled it out.

And it was,

there was a look that was given

and then the whole,

oh, and I go,

okay, so what happened was,

so yeah, so that was,

that was interesting.

Thank you again for that.

Again, we also have book called

Hookers and Blow Do Christmas.

That's one of my daughter's favorite books.

And then we also have

the Go the Fuck to Sleep series,

which I'm missing one of them

because my daughter brought it to school

for book day without telling daddy.

And I got a call from the teacher.

We also have

Butterfly and Amazing Parenting.

Let me tell you something right now.

My kids don't understand half the shit.

First off, we've never read these.

The Hookers and Blow story

is actually really good.

It's actually a really good Christmas story.

And Hookers is the name of the tow truck

that Hookers and Blow do.

And it's a really good book.

It hooks up cars.

And Blow is the name of the snowblower.

So you may have a dirty mind

and think of things,

but actually if it's anything,

it just goes to prove that

maybe you are the problem.

I missed the world

before I knew what it was.

I've never read the

Go the Fuck to Sleep ones to them.

That's just a joke book

that you guys sent to me.

And when I did read it to my son one time,

I just took out the

Go the F to Sleep and said,

now it's time to sleep.

Can I read it to you?

I already read Hookers and Blow to you guys.

Do Christmas.

Does your daughter know what a hooker is?

Hooker is a lot of different things.

Hooker furniture is a publicly traded stock.

Why am I justifying this to you?

Morning, sweetie.

What's up, dude?

Why am I even justifying?

I think I'm getting rage baited.

Yes, hooker furniture is a real thing.

No, not hooker furniture,

like furniture made by hooker.

No, no, it's called hooker furnishings.

All right.

Let's hear about Chauncey Billups.

Cash Patel, FBI assistant director

in charge, Christopher Rea.

Do they make tables?

Special agent in charge of the New York field office,

Leslie Bakshis.

You got bills to pay, Daniel?

New York special agent in charge of Homeland Security,

Ricky Patel.

New York special agent in charge of Homeland Security,

Michael McCarty,

Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch,

Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenney,

Chauncey Billups, the former player

and now coach, and Miami player

Terry Rozier were arrested in gambling probes.

I'm now going to turn the podium over.

To FBI director, Cash Patel.

That's right.

Release the list.

Good morning.

Today, we are here in New York to announce

a historic arrest across a wide-sweeping criminal

enterprise that enveloped both the NBA and La Casa Nostra.

The men and women up here standing with me

represent a small portion of the leadership team.

Okay, bro, chill.

That found justice in an era that needed it more than any.

I'll just highlight some of the details in the case

and the FBI work, and then you'll hear from the others.

But as you now know, individuals such as

Chauncey Billups, Damon Jones, and Terry Rozier

were taken into custody today.

Former current NBA players and coaches.

I guarantee somebody in the FBI

What you don't know is that this is an illegal

gambling operation and sports rigging operation

that spanned the course of years.

Lost a sports bet.

The FBI led a coordinated takedown

across 11 states to arrest over 30 individuals today

responsible for this case, which is very much ongoing.

Not only did we,

we crack into the fraud that these perpetrators

committed on the grand stage of the NBA,

but we also entered and executed

a system of justice against La Casa Nostra

to include the Bonanno, Gambino,

We executed an assistant coach, what?

and Luceci crime families.

And you'll hear more about those details today.

The charges and the arrests that were taken down

across this country range from wire fraud,

money laundering, extortion, robbery, illegal gambling.

Oh, chill.

This FBI,

I want a piece.

For any perpetrator of crime across this country.

You hear a lot about our work of defending the homeland

Guarantee you it was for like two grand too.

These guys are going to go to prison for 30 years for that.

This work is also representative of a colossal portion

of the FBI mandate.

If I only bet $2,000, nobody will know.

And to keep our entertainment industry fair and secure.

The men and women that are standing up here today

worked tireless hours, days, months, and years.

And the fraud is mind boggling.

It's not hundreds of dollars.

It's not thousands of dollars.

It's not tens of thousands of dollars.

It's not even millions of dollars.

We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in fraud.

That would be millions.

Theft and robbery across a multi-year investigation.

And we could not have done it without our interagency partners

that are before us today.

The NYPD, HSI, and teams of law enforcement officials

from around the country made this day possible.

It takes a team to bring this kind of justice,

sweeping justice into the halls

of the United States.

In the United States courtrooms,

where our brave United States attorney has led.

Imagine owing money to the cartel

and then having to shave points

to stand before you and say,

we will not allow this kind of illicit activity

to happen.

Not only at the national sporting level,

but also where it hides in La Casa Nostra.

And when these two collided together,

they perpetrated a fraud

that is historic in terms of not just money,

but the scheme and the deceit that they utilize.

To steal and swindle people from money

to include crypto fraud.

This is an operation that showcases to you.

Oh my God, it's just,

it's a false flag for the government to take your crypto.

Funny, we actually made a joke about that last week.

Either on the world's largest stage

or in the back rooms of tiny parlors

where guard games are being played.

We are proud to stand here today

with the men and women of the FBI

and this legal team.

And to the United States attorney,

I just want to thank you personally

for taking this time to be here.

Thank you for taking the time

to display the work

that the media is about to hear about today in detail.

As I said, it does take courageous prosecutors,

but it takes a courageous United States attorney

to bring this case

because we are going to take heat for it.

But we don't shy away in this administration.

We don't say no.

What we do is we bring the results across the finish line.

We bring them to the public.

We bring you accountability.

We need to bring the National Guard to Portland

to take out the trailblazers

for this criminal organization.

I'm telling you.

We will not deny anyone of due process.

And that's the brilliance.

That's the brilliance of this system.

That's the brilliance of this administration.

Everyone will be held to account.

So with that, I turn it over to United States attorney,

Nassau.

Thank you.

Thank you, Director Patel.

Do you think DraftKings will offer a parlay

on who the next player to get indicted is?

Indictments in two major cases,

both involving fraud.

One involves sports betting,

and the other involves illegal gambling,

very specifically rigged poker games.

The first indictment involves six defendants

Oh shit, good dip buy on it.

who are alleged to have participated

one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes

since online sports betting became widely legalized

in the United States.

This scheme is an insider sports betting conspiracy

that exploited confidential information

about National Basketball Association athletes and teams.

Can you like call the FBI tip line

and like just drop the name of a player on the team

that's your rival's team?

Alleged to have participated in a nationwide scheme

to rig illegal poker games.

These defendants,

which include former professional athletes,

used high-tech cheating technology

to steal millions of dollars from victims

in underground poker games

that were secretly fixed.

The games in the New York area

were backed by the Bonanno, Gambino,

and Genovese crime families of La Casa Nostra.

While the cases are separate,

there are three overlapping defendants

charged in both cases.

Mafia.

Oh, we are so back.

Damon Jones, Eric Ernest, and Shane Hennin.

The indictments in these cases contain only allegations,

and the defendants are presumed innocent

until they are proven guilty in a court of law.

But my message to the defendants

who've been rounded up today is this.

Your winning streak has ended.

Your luck has run out.

Violating the law is a losing proposition,

and you can do it.

You can bet on that.

First, I would like to talk about

United States v. Ernest,

the NBA basketball gambling case.

The defendants in this case are

Eric Ernest,

Marvez, Farley,

Shane Hennin,

I don't even know if that was a joke.

Damon Jones,

a former NBA player and coach,

and Terry Rosier,

a current NBA player.

Other co-conspirators were previously charged

for their roles,

including former NBA player John Tate.

Look how they didn't do any pictures.

Wait, why are they all...

Between December 2022 and March 2024,

these defendants perpetrated a scheme to defraud

by betting on inside non-public information

about NBA athletes' schemes.

I don't know who did this teleprompter,

but they need to figure this out.

The non-public information included

when specific players would be sitting out future games

or when they would pull themselves out early

for public opinion.

It was also when specific players would be sitting out

for public opinion about their own actions

and their own actions in the field.

They also misused information obtained

through unimportant injuries or unimportant injuries

or unimportant injuries or unimportant injuries

or unimportant injuries or unimportant injuries

or unimportant injuries.

They relied on corrupt individuals,

including Jones and Rosier.

They also misused information obtained

through long-standing friendships that they had

with NBA players and coaches.

And in at least one instance,

they got their information by threatening a current player,

Porter, because of his pre-existing gambling debts.

bets mostly in the form of prop bets on individual player performance the bets were placed through

online sports books and also in person at casinos the defendants relied on a network of straw

bettors to place the maximum amount of bets to increase their potential profits most of these

all right i'm gonna play owls again and the intended losses were in the millions of dollars

the defendants then laundered their illegal winnings in various ways peer-to-peer platforms

bank wires and simple cash exchanges holy shit the indictment gonna go after everybody specific

examples where the defendants profited from illegal gambling and illegal betting on various

nba games about the performance of players on among other things the charlotte hornets

the portland trailblazers the los angeles

league of the nation

and the toronto rangers each defendant in the nba basketball name is the ranger has been charged

with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering the fuck now i would

like to turn to the other case united states versus aiello the rigged poker uh canada nobody

cares but still beginning as early as 2019 the defendants in this case orchestrated a scheme to

use wire

and wireless cheating technology to run rigged poker games across the united states including in the

hamptons las vegas miami and manhattan the scheme targeted victims known as quote fish who were often

lured to participate

in these rigged games by the chance to play alongside former professional athletes who were

known as quote face cards the so-called feKing mini pc brothers in cosep's country leading the temple of the emperor against the court lords'

The so-called face cards included the defendant, Chauncey Billups,

who at the time of the scheme was a former NBA player

and is currently the head coach.

How is he at the time a former NBA player?

And also Damon Jones, a former NBA player and coach.

What the victims, the fish, didn't know is that everybody else at the poker game,

from the dealer to the players, including the face cards, were in on the scam.

Pickleball gambling next.

Once the game was underway, the defendants fleeced the victims

out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game.

The defendants used a variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies,

some of which were provided by other defendants

in exchange for a share of the profits from the scheme.

For example, they used off-the-shelf,

off-the-shelf shuffling machines that had been secretly altered

in order to read the cards in the deck,

predict which player at the table had the best poker hand,

and relay that information to an off-site operator.

The off-site operator sent the information via cell phone

back to the poker's theater at the table,

and that person at the table was known as the quarterback.

The quarterback.

Then signaled, secretly, the information he had received

to others at the table, and together they used that information

in order to win their games and to cheat the victims.

Defendants used other cheating technologies,

such as poker chip tray analyzers,

which is a poker chip tray that secretly reads cards

using a hidden camera.

Special contact lenses, or eyeglasses,

can read pre-marked cards and an x-ray table

that could read cards face down on the table.

Okay, that's different.

What you see depicted on the screen right now

is an example of the x-ray table that reveals the cards.

Although they are face down on the table,

they can be read because of the x-ray technology.

The mafia, specifically members and associates of the

How do I get one of those?

Gambino and Genovese organized crime families,

had pre-existing control over non-rigged, illegal poker games

around New York City.

Michael Porter Jr. actually snitched?

As a result, they also became involved in rigged poker games.

The fact that if he did and the FBI says that,

and he's talking about the cartel,

they just signed his fucking death warrant.

And working to enforce the collection of debts.

The defendants laundered their proceeds,

including through cash exchanges,

the use of multiple shell companies,

and through cryptocurrency transfers.

As part of this scheme,

some of the defendants and their co-conspirators

also committed acts of violence.

Including the gunpoint robbery of a person

in order to obtain a rigged shuffling machine

and extortion that were perpetrated against victims

in order to ensure that they repaid their gambling debts.

Defendants who participated in the rigged poker scheme

are charged with wire fraud conspiracy.

Other defendants have been charged with crimes

including illegal gambling,

money laundering,

Hobbs Act robbery,

and extortions.

This case demonstrates

how officers' unrelenting commitment

to fighting the scourge of organized crime

in whatever form it takes.

I'd like to conclude my remarks

by thanking the incredible hard work

of our law enforcement partners,

including the FBI,

Homeland Security,

the NYPD,

and the Waterfront Commission.

I also want to thank the dedicated

prosecutors who built these two cases

and who are standing to my right.

Benjamin Weintraub,

David Bourbon,

Caitlin Farrell,

Michael Gibaldi,

Iresa Chen,

and Sean Sherman.

They had the assistance of paralegal specialists

Liam McNett,

John Schneider,

Marlene Bosler.

Also deserving of our thanks

because of their outstanding investigative work

on the NBA case,

are FBI Special Agents

Russell Lantier,

Dominic Mariani,

Amy Giarosso,

Shane Wilkins,

and Supervisory Special Agent Luke Hardison.

On the rigged poker game scheme,

outstanding work was performed by

FBI Special Agents

Thomas Krivitz,

Jeff Boreola,

Jonathan Corona,

Alexander Silverman,

Amy Campanaro,

and Supervisory Special Agent

Michael Malehi,

as well as NYPD Task Officer

James McCullough,

and from Homeland Security,

Supervisory Special Agent Charles Freund,

and from the Waterfront Commission,

Detective Paul Schimborski.

Finally,

I want to note that the investigations

in both cases are ongoing,

and we encourage anyone with information

about either scheme

to please contact the FBI.

Now I would like to turn the podium over

to Special Agents,

in charge of the New York Field Office,

I should say the Assistant Director in charge

of the New York Field Office of the FBI,

Christopher Rea.

Chris?

Chris, get your shit together.

All right, thank you, Joe.

As always, we appreciate the partnership here.

Can't do any of this without you and your team,

so thank you.

I also want to publicly thank the Director

for coming down from D.C.

The Director is a very busy person,

and for him to come down should tell you the importance

of this historic campaign.

In this case, I'm Christopher Rea,

the Assistant Director in charge

of the FBI New York Field Office.

Today, as you heard,

our office conducted

a massive nationwide takedown

from two indictments

of 34 defendants

for their alleged involvement

in two separate illegal poker

and sports betting schemes

where, as you heard, the odds were

rigged in their favor.

Among these defendants

are 13 members and

associates of the Bonanno,

Gambino,

and Genovese crime families

to include

capos and soldiers

from these families.

Additionally, as you heard,

current and former

NBA coaches and players

are also implicated

to include Chauncey Billups,

Damon Jones,

and Terry Rozier.

Three of the named defendants

are charged for their alleged role

in both schemes.

This alleged illegal gambling

operation hustled unwitting

victims out of tens

of millions of dollars

and created a financial pipeline

for La Cosa Nostra

to help fund and facilitate

their organized

criminal activity.

Victims were attracted

to play alongside well-known

professional athletes and coaches

like Chauncey Billups,

only to be unknowingly deceived

through rigged shuffling machines

fixing the odds in their favor

as alleged

and as you just heard

from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

This alleged scheme

wreaked havoc across the nation

exploiting the notoriety

of some and the wallets

of many to fund

the Italian crime family

here in New York.

Let me be clear about this fact.

The FBI

has not

and will never

take their eye off the ball

when it comes to Italian

organized crime in this city.

Specifically the LCN

and the five families

here in New York.

We are not going to permit

any criminal enterprise

whether it be Italian organized crime

Asian organized crime

Eurasian organized crime

we are not going to permit any of those

organized crime families

and organizations to operate in our city

as evidenced by the 11 states

that will also participate

in this operation today.

The FBI office

here in New York remains committed

to eradicating all unlawful

revenue streams fueling

this criminal activity.

I am offended.

I am proud.

I will tell you this.

The LCN squad agents

and analysts

will continue to work day and night

with the Eastern District of New York

to ensure members and associates

of the five families

cannot continue to wreak havoc

in our communities.

Not the gay fishes.

Today would not have been possible

without the tireless efforts

and dedication of the FBI New York Eurasian

Organized Crime Task Force

which as you heard was led by Supervisory Special Agent

Slow News Day for sure.

And the Italian Organized Task Force

which was led by

Supervisory Special Agent Mike

and coincidentally

Supervisory Special Agent Malahi

is going out on a positive

as he is retiring at the end of this month

for 30 years of dedicated service

to the FBI.

So you've docked the guy.

You've told about all the cartel people

he's taken down and now told everybody

he's no longer going to be part of the FBI.

Well this is going to go well for him.

Additionally, obviously we cannot do this alone

without our partners.

I want to extend my appreciation

to Homeland Security Investigation

Special Agent in Charge Ricky Patel.

Without the NYPD,

New York City Police...

They're literally fucking giving out

people that should be a witness protection

and just be like yeah this player

Phoebe Soriel

snitched on the cartel.

It's like wait what? Yeah and he's in Denver

which is where cartels really like to go straight to.

Oh okay.

I'm just saying

I would bench him if you have him in fantasy.

That's all I'm saying.

Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Special Agent

in Charge of HSI, Ricky Patel.

Thanks Chris.

Good afternoon everyone. My name is Ricky Patel

I'm the Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security

Investigations here in New York.

This morning, hundreds of Special Agents and Investigators

with HSI, the FBI,

the New York Waterfront

Commission and the NYPD

descended upon the homes of individuals

who for years have operated

with the false sense of impunity

a false sense of

incivility.

In the early hours of today, across nine

states coast to coast, dozens of

defendants were arrested and will face

the consequences of their alleged crimes.

This was their wake up call.

With the alleged involvement of three

Lacosa Nostra crime families,

one NBA head coach, a

Hall of Famer, no less,

former NBA players,

the years of investigative work

that culminated with this morning's

operation seem reminiscent

of a Hollywood movie.

But this wasn't luck

and this wasn't theatrics.

This was an evidence driven

relentless and unified effort

among law enforcement.

Through what we have dubbed Operation

Royal Flush, HSI New York

along with our task force personnel

from the Waterfront Commission

first uncovered this scheme more than four years ago.

Agents and investigators

dedicated countless

hours and sleepless nights

in identifying the criminal network

dissecting communications and patterns

and following the money with precision.

We built a case

piece by piece

and what we discovered was a sprawling

criminal enterprise that utilized

cutting edge technology and various

methods of deception

to dupe unsuspecting gamblers

into paying up so that these

defendants could cash out.

As alleged,

this sophisticated conspiracy cheated victims

out of at least $7 million

and placed the public and the

defendants alike at risk.

This case involved global reach,

financial depth, and the patience

to dismantle complex financial

criminal enterprises from the inside out.

When criminal organizations attempt

to launder profits through our country,

HSI connects the dots and shuts it down.

To anyone who thinks intimidation,

fraud, or violence

will shield their profits,

understand this. If you are exploiting

our communities, expect HSI

and all of our law enforcement partners

at your door. I would like to

thank all our partners here today.

Thanks for QS. The two calls I have left are up 58%.

The Waterfront Commission, the FBI,

the NYPD, and the prosecutors

that will carry this forward.

Today's arrests are not an end point.

They are the start of accountability.

Thank you, and I now turn it over

to Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.

Did they just make that guy's name up?

Jessica Tisch? Uh oh, my wife's here.

Good morning. Thank you to

Director Patel, Assistant Director

Rea, and U.S. Attorney Nasella.

What we're announcing

today is not just another takedown.

It's the result of

more than two years of coordinated

investigative work by the NYPD's

Joint Organized Crime Task Force

and the FBI.

Two cases that exposed criminal

networks led by 34 individuals

who believe the rules

did not apply to them.

They hid behind layers of complexity,

behind money, and behind

influence believing those things

would shield them from accountability.

The first case, Operation

Nothing But Bet, exposed

a gambling ring built around professional

basketball, where players

and associates allegedly used inside

information to manipulate

prop bets on

major sports betting platforms.

They placed wagers on

unders on players to score

less,

rebound less,

assist less,

using information that was not yet

public. In some instances,

players altered their performance

or took themselves out of games

to make sure that those bets

paid out. One example,

on March 23, 2023,

in Charlotte, Terry

Rogier, an NBA player, now

with the Miami Heat, but at the time

playing for the Hornets, allegedly

let others close to him

know that he planned to

leave the game early with a

supposed injury. Using that information,

members of the group placed more than

$200,000 in wagers on his

under statistics.

Rogier exited the game

after just nine minutes, and the

bets paid out, generating tens of

thousands of dollars in profit.

The proceeds were later delivered

to his home, where the group

counted their cash.

As the NBA season

tips off, his career is already

benched, not for injury,

but for integrity.

As a result of this investigation,

six dependents, including Rogier,

are now facing conspiracy to commit

bank and wire fraud. In a second case,

Operation Zen Diagram,

investigators uncovered a long-term

wire scheme in which members and

associates of several well-known

organized crime families rigged high

stakes poker games across

the country. These operatives

included capos and multiple

soldiers from the Bonanno,

Gambino, Lucchese, and Genovese

crime families, bringing four

of the five families together

in a single indictment,

at least extraordinarily rare.

It reflects how deep and how far

this investigation reached,

and the skill and the persistence

it took to get here.

That work uncovered a deliberate,

technologically sophisticated

operation designed to carry

out their crimes. They used

custom shuffling machines that could read

the order of cards, barcoded

decks, and hidden cameras built into

tables and light fixtures.

The organizers also enlisted

well-known public figures,

former and current NBA players

and coaches, including

Chauncey Billups, the head coach

of the Portland Trail Blazers, and

NBA champion and a

Hall of Famer, to make the games

appear legitimate.

Victims believed that they were

sitting at a fair table instead.

They were cheated out of millions.

One victim in particular lost

$1.8 million in total losses

exceeding $7 million in

continued decline, and when

people refused to pay.

These defendants did

what organized crime

has always done. They used

threats, they used intimidation,

and they used violence. It's the

same pattern that we have seen

for decades. Traditional mob

enforcement methods combined

with new technology to

expand the reach of their operations.

Now with the unsealing

of today's indictment, 34

individuals are facing charges

including robbery, extortion,

money laundering, wire fraud, bank

fraud, and illegal gambling.

I want to commend the outstanding

work of our detectives from the

Joint Organized Crime Task Force

and their dedication to these

cases, especially Captain

Ruben Pagan, Sergeant

Chris McGuire, Detective

Alexander Creamer,

No guys, we're not going to investigate

every player that had a good game against you in fantasy.

As part of these investigations,

our members recovered and reviewed

thousands of hours of

video, conducted extensive

surveillance on illegal gambling locations

across the city, and executed

more than two dozen search

warrants on electronic records that reveal

the true extent of this

conspiracy. Once again,

the work of our detectives, together

with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's

Office, closed those gaps before

they could widen further.

The NYPD is proud to stand with

each of you today as these cases

represent the kind of partnership

that defines modern law

enforcement agencies, sharing

intelligence, coordinating resources,

and moving as one team.

Thank you.

Do streamers do something like this too?

If anyone has

any questions that they'd like

to ask, now is the time.

I'm not at liberty to discuss

either the background of the investigation

or

the investigation

as it continues, so I'm afraid I

can't really explain to you other

than the fact that both cases

have been unsealed today, and there was

an overlap that has been discussed already

with respect to certain

other defendants. Yes.

With respect to any

allegations or defenses

that have been made by any of the

defendants, they will have their

opportunity to present them in court.

We're not here to air those

at this time or to discuss them.

Yes. Really?

As I said, I can't discuss ongoing

investigations. How many human sacrifices have I performed this year?

This year? None.

My definition means that there

will be further evidence uncovered at a

minimum, and there's always that

possibility, but I can't comment

any further with respect to that.

Yes. Oh, him, not me.

Okay. It's not popular to

go after some of the defendants that we went

after today, but

justice is served blindly,

and how do we counterman that?

Simply. The unsealing of

these indictments today shows the force

of the Department of Justice and our great

Attorney General and the leadership that we have at

the FBI and the team here to

specifically mete out justice.

And look, let's not, you know, mince

words. This is the insider trading

saga for the NBA.

That's what this is. That's why we are

going to take heat. But as the evidence

comes out, as the indictments are unsealed,

you will see the extensive work these men and women

put in. Countless hours over years.

And that's how we countermand it.

To be fair, I don't know a lot of the shit that

we're not told, so you never know. Maybe they

stopped a whole bunch of shit.

We will not publicly discuss the timing

of when we do takedowns.

I will only say that we do takedowns

in a coordinated fashion with our law enforcement

partners and the U.S. Attorney at the

appropriate time to make sure that we ensure

the integrity of the investigation, as the

United States Attorney said, an investigation

that is very much ongoing.

Insider trading.

What about the administration?

Simple. If you're participating in the legal

gambling industry, you got nothing to worry about.

If you're participating in illegal conduct,

you got everything to worry about, and this case shows it.

I'm not sure I quite understand your

question. You're asking...

Funny what the SEC director said today, too.

The sports

books themselves

are victims in this case. They

themselves did not,

as far as our investigation has concluded,

they did not perpetrate

anything unlawful.

I'm not going to respond to that

at this time, but that information will

be made public. Yes.

Yes, tell me.

When you say the access point...

Are there index to invest

in the S&P, but not tech?

Yeah, here you go.

We're not at liberty to say that at this

time. That will be revealed in due

course. Yes.

What is your question, sir?

Right here.

XLF, XLE, there's a lot of different sectors

you can invest in ETF-wise.

I was three years old when that video came out,

and you're about as still as intelligence.

Let me repeat that

all of the defendants

themselves are presumed innocent.

We believe that

at a trial,

when they have the opportunity

to present their defenses if they chose,

because they're not required to,

we will come forward with the evidence

to demonstrate their guilt.

Can you explain what's going on? Yes.

Yeah, a bunch of NBA players

owed money to the cartels, and

they shaved points. The answer to your question is yes.

The NBA has cooperated with the investigation.

Yes, sir.

The investigations that we

announced today did not involve college basketball.

Joe Olsen of Kal-El

just resubbed for six months.

I never said that at TwitchCon, Johnny.

Iced fish on the floor.

Alright, this is almost over.

We're going to move on. I've got lots to talk about today.

No, I'm sorry. That would be

a question that goes beyond

what we're here to

discuss today, which is these two indictments.

Thank you.

They named who was the snitch, too.

That's crazy. Funny, too, that they're

talking about the

insider trading, too, because the

SEC chair this morning said the agency

is watching for what he calls hanky-panky

in markets, even as a shutdown drags on.

Really?

Hmm. Hmm.

Yeah, if you have MPJ on your fantasy team,

you might want to cut them.

Or you might want to put up a trade offer before

the news gets out, just in case.

Alright, QS, we're still in.

We had a second purchase

here when it went under, sorry, what was it?

Under 15.

So we're up pretty good on this today.

This was off of, a weird reason why I took

this was because of the whole quantum thing, even though

they just have quantum in their name.

But more importantly, they also had their

financial update

and the fact that the Trump

administration said they want to take stakes in quantum

companies, and then there's an announcement today

at 3, so I don't know how it worked, but it

worked out. We'll take it when we get it.

Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. VC we played

this morning. We got stopped out. We played it again. We're up

pretty big on this right now.

Um, where we at on

this? 12% on this

now. So, that's doing pretty

good. Um, lot of

bounce backs today. NNE's up 6%.

We got SHMD, which we went into

this morning. We're up 25% on.

So this is the one that we played yesterday.

Made on the first one, made like 12%

on the first time, and then lost 5%

the second time. I went back in this morning when it was like

$3.30

or something like that. It's up 25%

right now. We got a stop loss on it of 5%.

So we'll see how that plays out.

Uh, why am I playing Rider?

So,

again, my trades

and your trades should not be the same. You

shouldn't be doing the same thing I do for the same reasons I

do. I am playing a dip

buy on this because

Rider actually had their earnings

this morning, and their earnings

were not that bad. Their outlook

and guidance was a little bit off.

Uh, they actually beat on EPS

by 3 cents, uh, and their

revenue, um, was down

1.5% year-over-year, but beat by

10 million. Um, their

non-gap EPS was up 4%

year-over-year as well. Um,

for the fiscal year 2025,

we had their ROE.

They're expecting 17%.

Uh, comparable non-gap

EPS, they're looking at

the high end or the middle of the range.

1285 to 1305, and operating

revenue was only increased by 1%.

Um, it was a

very mute earnings. It was kind of like an eh.

You know what I mean? Like an eh. And in this

market, if you're not really killing it,

nobody cares. However,

however,

they did announce two different buybacks.

They're doing a discretionary

repurchase, uh, of 2 million shares

between October of this year and October 2027.

And then they're also doing

an anti-dilutive, uh, repurchase

plan to purchase up to 1.5 million.

Uh, starting

August of this year, uh, they've increased

it. So, what I'm doing is,

is I'm buying this right here and looking

and waiting probably till

end of day today or tomorrow, hopefully,

for this to move back up to that 175

range. Does it do it?

I don't know. But,

they're taking out 3.5 million

shares from the market

and they have a float of, uh, 39.

So, we're talking about almost a 10%

uh, uh, anti-dilutive

measure here. Now, it's gonna be two years

that plan takes place. So, it's not something that you're

gonna expect in the short term. But, I'm seeing

if this has a rebound. I could be wrong here.

But, uh, it feels like this

might be a bit of an oversell. Again, it's not me

that makes these decisions. So, I'm gonna be hanging

on to this. It's only an hour into the market.

So, I'm not really concerned right now. MOH is more so,

uh, a FOMO play for people who missed out on

all the other dips on healthcare. It's dragged the

entire healthcare sector down today. Um,

this is like, uh, the FOMO of

people who didn't get the bottom of UNH and

um, and, uh, and

all the other ones. They might be looking at this and

it's actually been holding pretty steady this morning. It's, uh,

it's, it's, it's finding it's, I'm not a TA

guy, but for TA people, you

know, you're looking at this and you're saying, wait a second.

This is, uh, this is, this is, this is,

this is making a bull flag here.

Right? Because, not that I care

about this, but when you, when you, when you, when you look at

this, you're getting that, you know,

you're getting a channel here and it's,

you know, looking

like it's about to pop. I, I don't fucking

play TA though. Do you have R

shares or calls? I have, uh, R, uh,

R calls. Uh, but, uh,

I, I, I took close to the money ones.

I got 170s. So that

way if I'm wrong, I don't have to worry about, um,

losing too much.

Um, uh, but if I'm right then I, uh,

I can get a nice trade out of it.

Why do I hear your wife showering?

You guys are gonna miss that.

The guy who doesn't really trade options,

trade bought to calls. Again, you misunderstood

what I said. I'm not

full porting all my stuff in options.

I'm using this as, instead of

putting all my shares, because I want my, my

capital, my, my share capital

to be able to buy speculative stuff, right?

I don't want to buy options on spec stocks because

the IV's too high and it's a waste. I'd rather put the shares

in there. In stuff that's like larger

cap stuff like this, I'd prefer to do one option

so I don't have to tie up 10 grand to make 5%.

You see what I mean? My, my speculative stocks

can move 10, 20% in a week. These usually

move a couple percent. So what I like to do

is, is, is the large cap stocks I like to do

the options on.

Does Delaware have good internet? Apparently

we have really good internet, uh, at the place we're staying.

Shares or calls on Oscar?

Oh, I got, uh, shares. I bought

shares when it hit 19 this morning. Um,

I like Oscar. I think

that, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's,

you know, in the healthcare sector, it's still a sleeper.

We bought Oscar back in 2021

the first time because they were,

their, their main focus was on gig workers

and, uh, gig worker insurance. And

because everybody was going into gig work, it was good. But then

when the, the, the whole spec and meme and, and

everything crashed in 2022, it went down big.

I actually sold it for a loss. But it's come roaring

back because it is a major, it's becoming a

major player in the healthcare, especially for, for alternative

healthcare. Like my in-laws, they have

Oscar, right? Because it, they, they covers

them. And, you know, people that are here

that are, this is a weird thing to say, but

people that are here that are

on visas and here that are visiting and stuff like that

don't want to go to the hospital.

They want to keep quiet, you know, like just

kind of chill. And so they end up paying

a lot of premiums without ending

up, um, actually

utilizing it. So that's one of those

ones where it's a good profit margin.

I know it sounds terrible, but it's part of, like, something

I look at. And so I kind of like

Oscar Health. The healthcare sector's

been beat up pretty bad, but I still like them.

Um, so again, that's just me and my

personal, you know, take on that. We're up really

big today. We actually gained back everything we were down

yesterday. Gilt is up 6%,

NNE's up 6%, SoFi's up

3.5%, Palantir's up 3%,

Google's up 1%, um,

SHMD's killing it right now.

WeRide's up 5%, NVX is up 4%,

SGBX is up, uh, another

35% today, TSSI

4%, Joby 3%, um,

MNTS 7%,

Rivian 0.5%, STSS 5%, um,

Poet 6%, MLG 0.6%,

so we got some big movers today, uh, gaining back

what we had yesterday. So all the dips I bought yesterday,

I'm selling the rips today. And

if, if it keeps going up,

then I have my shares, and if it falls,

I have capital to do it again.

Is UUU ever going to stop going up?

I actually found a weird

clip from my channel,

um,

from six months ago,

where I was explaining why UUU

was gonna keep going and, and, and

uranium and everything like that, and then somebody goes,

do you understand that? And so I go, ooga booga, yellow

cake go up.

Why not?

Can you give us some music? Sure.

Alright, so what is this CS thing

real quick, before I move on? What is this CS

thing you guys are talking about?

Counter-Strike. Okay, I've heard of it, it's a game, I know that.

So what is the, what is the big thing

going on? Skin market crashed?

Jesus, I'm thinking

Ed Gein when you say skin market.

CS market crashes almost 2 billion

overnight, following

controversial knife and glove

trade update, up update.

It had a 4 billion dollar

market cap? Valve made

knives easier to get, which made the cost less, and the

market cost value went from 6 billion to 5 billion.

Hi bro, looking super smooth,

submissive and breedable today, hope you have a

great stream. Hey thanks man, I appreciate you.

So they had a huge skin market,

add an update which let you craft skins from

the worst skins. So basically

they diluted it, they just diluted it, right?

They basically did an offering.

They're also saying that Valve employees knew about it

and bought into the redskins

before the update, there's proof of buy orders in the market.

Who do you think lost more money?

People who bought skins at the top or Beyond Meat

at 750 yesterday?

I made 25% of my puts, if I would have held

I would have made 50%. Which is funny

because I made money off of

Beyond Meat playing it

to the upside, I sold too early but

still played to the upside. Took that money

and bought flowers yesterday pre-market

100 flowers, that went 60%.

And then we had the money in SGBX

which after hours went 121%.

And that was like, we had

we were in three pumps.

Now flowers I didn't sell at the top, I'm a little upset

about that, but either way

what a fucking day yesterday was.

SGBX is still up.

That cost to borrow is like 600% right now.

Uh oh. A sundress is

getting put on. You have something to tell me.

Uh oh, what happened? You're doing analysis.

Okay. How am I feeling?

A lot better watching you

get changed.

I'm feeling great, best I've felt in years.

No, because anytime that I have

a little bit of pain or something like that, you lose

all, like, interest in that thing.

So from now on, I am tip top, great shape.

You lose interest in everything?

Okay. You get nervous. I know you get nervous and scared.

That's why I'm not going to say anything.

I'm good, I'm good. My chest was hurting last night

and this morning, but I'm good now.

It's a lot better. It's really good. Best it's been.

So what are you doing analysis on?

What are you doing analysis on?

Oh god, here we go.

I gotta pretend to care. Yeah, you think?

What are we thinking?

You're probably right.

Yeah.

That's a pretty good analysis, I agree.

Yeah, quick question.

You're so funny how you're pretending like you're not about to use what I say.

Quick question.

How do you use gift cards?

So basically, like, you can utilize it for

redeeming stuff, like if you want to pay for

subscriptions, bits,

stuff like that, you can use it.

So for example, if you want to

Am I getting it? Well, it depends on what kind of

gift card it is. You can get merch and stuff like that.

Oh, you buy it? Yeah, you buy it.

Well, they have that too, where like if you do

a little survey, Twitch will send you a $5 gift card

or something like that. Okay, she's gone.

Alright, so

I gotta get my merch going again. I gotta get my

F-Cube shirt, my Defund the HOA

trophy husband, and

don't trip by the dip, and

keep calm and DCA on.

I gotta get those back.

Alright, so, yeah, so

what is this real quick? So basically, they

had, okay, so explain

so explain to me again how this works.

So, basically

there's a limited number of a certain type

of skin, like a knife in the game,

I'm guessing, and

you get them via, what, you find

them in the game, you buy them, how does that work?

It's loot boxes. So basically,

you're gambling,

call xQc,

he's not, he's not awake right now.

Keep the door closed, dear!

My dog just attacked my nanny, hold on.

Okay, um, who's somebody

who plays CS? Is there

anybody online who plays CS?

That I might know?

We're in the same agency.

Oh, he turned the ability to knock off.

Okay, who else? Summit?

He's not gonna see this.

I doubt he's gonna pick up, but I'll ask him.

Read his title, don't talk to him?

Oh, third trying to hate myself,

don't talk to me. Oh, that's my bad.

Okay.

Oh.

Was he talking to me?

What happened? What'd he say?

Alright, we'll find somebody else.

You're being annoying, basically?

Anybody else?

Niamh?

Who else?

I'm just randomly calling people. What about Moxie?

Alright, I got it. My fire staff's a triple team with fire, so...

These guys are all doing

like, um...

Does Quinn play Counter-Strike?

Gloves?

Yeah, they're both the same thing, so it doesn't help.

My one's pretty good, though.

It's got that, and, uh...

Strike conditioning.

Oh, no, I saw the one coming.

What's with the squids, kid?

I'm trying, I'm trying to get everything.

Oh, you found me, found me, found me.

He put Salt's mom on me.

Why?

What? That's not nice.

Pay that back.

This is just gonna be a stream of me getting shut down by every other streamer.

Salt's mom!

I just have bad timing.

Like, I'm just bowling a china chop.

I'm not gonna play anymore. I'm gonna be a good guy.

Probably a good guy.

Stop fucking spinning, bro.

You're just mad I have a mom.

Bro, you are such an unk. 30 seconds with ChatGPT

and you get all your answers.

And you're not a content creator, that's why you're watching me.

I could do that, but that's not as fun

as Chat watching me get shut down by every streamer

and then finally getting a streamer to fucking pick up.

Come on, dude, now I'm gonna actually bump them.

Gonna bump them.

Yeah, I wouldn't be fucking you in damage

if I had, like, my ult.

That is straight useless.

No, guys, Salt's mom isn't actually dead.

I wouldn't make that joke.

Wake up.

I should just call him on Discord.

Is his mom dead, question mark?

You mad glazing?

Stop that, let me use you.

I'm in the middle of something right now, dude.

I'm playing Modern Rivals.

I'm such an asshole.

I'm such an asshole.

I'm not that guy.

How does he know?

Oh, I love being a dickhead.

I'm gonna find people who are really busy

and just fucking, just nag them.

Did he just ban me?

I'll find somebody, don't worry.

All the people I'm friendly with,

I'm about to, like...

Who else plays it? What is it? CS, right? CS2?

Are you related to GaryVee, big dog?

No.

Quinn might know? Yeah, but I don't understand Quinn when he talks.

Even his, his, this is annoying.

Alright, I don't know. Does Clean play?

You understand XQC?

Yeah, because I know the TISM.

Alright, fuck it, I'll find somebody else.

Like, do I just randomly knock on

a CS2 player

and see if they do?

Wait, does this guy follow me? No.

He used to follow me.

Oh, he's Brazilian? Okay.

Okay, I don't want to spend an hour doing this.

It was funny for a second, but now I'm just getting annoyed.

I can explain?

Yeah, but it's not as funny.

I think you guys are just enjoying watching me get fucking denied.

Let's see, who are these people?

Do I know any of these names?

I don't know any of these names, man.

HotGamerDude, hell yeah.

Hi there, I have a

CS question.

I was hoping

you could help me

with.

Yes.

He's in a tournament? Leave me alone.

FlareyCS.

FlareyCS?

It's gonna be 5k.

I don't get first though.

Someone else get first this time.

Let's go. Let's go.

Hi there.

I was

wondering if

you could

help me.

It was bountiful.

Um, understand

I lost money.

I lost money. I'm not saying

I'm in it with you.

What I'm trying to tell you is

it was bound to crash.

It can't just go up, up, up, up.

What happened?

You don't know. Arrow is in the mountains

right now.

He sounds like you.

You can trade up skins.

Oh my god.

Oh my god bro.

But the skins that 20x aren't even affected.

I'll try knocking.

I'm just randomly calling people.

They're affected. I have zero clout.

8k point disarray went from 35 pounds

to 400.

That is what? A 14x.

Good music stay on this channel.

Yes it is fucking affected. The skins that

don't hold any inherent fucking value.

Chat, type how much

you would buy an 8k point disarray for.

Would you pay?

Why do people pay for these things so much? I don't get it.

Let alone 400 pounds guys. 400 pounds.

Great British pounds.

Is there like people that

Do people like want others to see it

or something?

Or is it just an investment?

This shit is. Which call? What do you mean pick up?

Wait who? Who? Who?

There's like 4 different group chats. Literally who?

Which one? Which one? Which one?

There is no group chat.

Pick up the stock guy's call.

The stock guy wants to collaborate.

I don't want to collaborate. I have a question.

I don't know who you are either.

Hi.

Hi. Call.

Call. Pick up.

I don't know who you are either.

He heard that. He heard that. That's funny.

I'm knocking on you. I'm knocking.

Oh there we are. Hello?

Hello?

I guess he can't hear me.

Yeah hey what's up?

What's up bird?

I'm the stock guy.

And you were

recommended from my chat asking me

to get a

fix on this situation

with the market. I deal with markets

and I deal with this stuff but

I don't understand CS skins.

I've never played CS before

and I don't understand how

this works. Could you give me

like you're talking to your grandparents

understanding of the CS

skin market? Okay.

I'll be very very simple. How much do you know about CS? Like not

nothing like how it actually works?

I haven't the last time I think

I was in a lobby once and somebody called me

a dumb

degenerate old ass piece

of shit blank blank blank

and get good you fucking retard

and then I never played again so

that's all I really know. Okay.

Okay welcome to Counter Strike. I can keep it

very very simple. Okay so what happened

imagine prices were

basically determined by

return on investment. I don't know if you're watching the stream.

I am. But as you

can see on this site every single case

comes with different skins and different

knives right and it's

gambling it's never profitable because if it was profitable

it's free money. You get me?

Yeah. So if I click on a

random case right as you can see here

it has it's just gambling right.

You open the case and as you can see here case

costs $5 the key costs $2.50

so open this once. So what makes

them valuable? I don't mean to cut you off but I'm like

why are they valuable? Is it because other people

can see it and they know you have it so it looks cool

or is it just because you're trying to like read

and resell it?

In game as you can see here you got all these skins

and you play the game right?

You're playing the game anyway but you can have these

skins and these skins have no

skin has like makes you play better.

Does that make sense? Yeah.

They're literally just virtual skins

but some have different animations

but that's it. The reason why they

have a price is again like I said

to open this case once

is $7.50

and in order to hit

this knife. Sorry about my voice.

You have to open about $375

so if I simulate

this right now okay as you can see here

this is fake unboxing okay

if I open 500 cases

here boom you can

see down here okay I just spent $4,000

and made

$4,400 total

and I just hit a free

2.4k knife. So it's like

NFTs.

The idea of a skin

might be but cases is not an

NFT. Cases is just gambling.

Like I'm not big into

NFTs but like imagine like an NFT has

a certain

a certain supply

you can always create

supply here. Does that make sense?

But you don't physically own the skin right?

Yes and no.

You own it but of course like it's not like an NFT

like it's still valid like they could ban

you they could change it. Does that make sense?

Well okay that's like the issue where the NFT

could just disappear I understand what you're saying.

Okay so

now basically it's

just because I understand how

a market works right like how this market

works supply and demand and you know

people trying to chase value. I'm trying to

understand why they're valuable like

it's just because it

costs people so much money to

try to get them that that's what gives it

value because it doesn't give you any advantage in the game.

People can't even see it really because they're getting shot in the

face. So what gives these skins

value? It is purely

I can give you a really good example

give me a sec. It's like an NFT right like

if there's like the more rare it was the

more valuable people were you know

willing to spend it even though it wasn't actually an

actual hard asset it was a non-tangible

or non-fungible. Yeah so

I'll keep it very very simple so you hear

this is for example just a random

karamba okay this is a knife. As you can see

since it came out in 2015

I'm in pounds but it started at

280 pounds okay

and the easiest way to explain it

is as more players have come

in there's the

supply that basically the players the demand

for these skins has been faster

than the supply you can create because

they're hard to unbox right

they're hard to unbox

basically the price is naturally

all of this is natural demand

this is just natural demand during COVID

as well 2020 big increase

because people were stuck indoors

it's just natural demand

the reason why

this is the biggest crash and update

we've ever had is

this is determined okay so

the easiest way to explain it is

think about the case right in order to get

this you have to gamble

and when you do gamble again

if I show you you're not determined

that exact knife so as you

can see it's a 1 in 391

to open one of these gloves

and in this

case is all these gloves

and you could get look here this glove

which is only worth $100

you could also get this glove which is

worth $56 it's all like

yeah I understand so it's just a simple supply

and demand there's no actual

value or asset or anything

that's actually of value

it's just simple supply and demand

and people are basically just

gambling that they're going to get something that they can resell

for a higher value because there's nothing they can actually use

yeah so

basically it was also supply and demand

the demand was increasing every single time in this

game that's why price naturally went up

and it was backed because it was rare

it was hard to get

the reason why this is crashed

is because you can trade up to an amount

what that basically means

is do you see these redskins

that you can trade up to

yeah I get what you're saying

I totally get what you're saying

I just wanted to kind of get like an idea

like I see the people in the chat that are like defending it to the death

they remind me of the altcoin maxis

but no okay so I get that

so the reason I called you though is I was like

can you explain to me like what happened

so basically what I told my chat told me was

is that basically they made it a way

that you could just make more of them

so kind of like diluting it so now the rarity is gone

because you can just make more

to explain it

so can you give me explain

same way I explained it

the case

the whole thing is originally the case right

so not only can you get these max wins the golds

you can get these bad skins

and imagine

there's a thing called trade ups

and it looks like this in game

and you can do

10 skins into the higher rarity

so as you can see here

if you delete 10 blues

you can get 1 purple

1 purple equals 1 pink

does that make sense?

exactly

but you could never trade it

you could only go from blue to red

you could never go up to a gold

so the gold was purely fixed by gambling

the case

and what they've done is not only make it

so you can now trade up the reds

you can also

the big thing which is the main reason

why a lot of people think they wanted it to crash

all of these look are 10 skins

10 skins right

they've made it so it's only 5 skins

and you can send this trade up right now

so what does this also mean

because for what

10-15 years you could never trade

the red to the yellow

reds naturally

were super cheap

you would often find the pinks more expensive

than the bad reds

you still with me?

what happened is

if I show you this thing

you can formulate a trade up

if you wanted a cool play skin like this

it was expensive

$200

but when the update came out

we saw all of these bad skins

were $4

$3

so when the update first hit

you literally had a market of $3

and suddenly you could spend

$15 and get

$2,000

$10,000

nice I get it now

so now in the past 10 hours

the $3 skins have now naturally crept up

to $33

and as these skins have

gone up in price

if I show you right now

for example this one

before this update $2

and as you can see here

for years this has been

just flat flat flat

and look what happened right now

it has gone from £1 to £30

ok so I get it

so it wasn't so much that people could

do their own or whatever

you used to have to grind

to get these cheaper items

and then it took a bunch of them to upgrade

to an expensive item

but now they made that item so readily available

that you could just easily upgrade right away

without having to

use more to upgrade

yeah

it's what separated knives and gloves

to the skins

I shouldn't say grind

I should just say pay for it

that was the wrong word

you used to have to spend a lot of money to upgrade to more money

which decreases the value

no not really

the skins already exist

does that make sense

these skins already exist

and you could always trade up to any skin you wanted

but what separated the golds

the knives and the gloves

which you can see in game here

it was purely cases

so you need to understand

the reason why

golds and knives and gloves

are really really expensive

is just work it out let's say it's like $7

to open one case

and on paper you should hit one in 391 cases

which means

to hit a gold on one case

you have to pay $3k

so you pay

a very high premium

for the opportunity

at a gold

but the gold could also be $50

so this gamble this high buy in

kept the golds separate

from these prices

are you understanding that part

yeah I'm just

going to go forward

but yeah I got you

so basically it is a type of a dilution

so something that was just rare

became very common

and so that basically

you're crashing the market

because it's some supply and demand

because it used to be expensive to buy it

now it's cheap to buy it

and so it dilutes everything

yeah there was a really good tweet

I can show you done by this guy Frank

so he basically worked out

that in the entire supply

and he basically said

in theory if you were to trade up

every single skin from all the way from the blue

like every skin

every single skin in the game

which in theory is impossible

it would only add

2x to the total knife supply

so what that basically means is

there is a cap on it

there is a cap

and this is on paper

this would never actually work

so what it basically means is

if the supply theoretically could only ever increase

to 2x

it could only theoretically

the price drop by half

what we're seeing

the reason why some skins have dropped 75%

is the initial panic sell

a lot of people

because it's a video game and it's not like a crypto market

a lot of people who are in this

like I asked chat

a lot of people say their CS inventory

is 90% of their net worth

so what I'm hearing then is

this is a big F up on their part

they're going to have to come out and fix this

they're going to have to come out and fix this

they're going to have to come out and fix this

what's happened

what's happened brother

is for the past year

we have gone through market manipulation

pumping a lot of people

so Valve basically sat there saying

you understand crypto right

it can't keep going

especially with this

it can't keep going up

careful my crypto people are about to go nuts

when you said it can't keep going up

calm down calm down don't get me in trouble

I understand the theory of

for someone to win someone has to lose

to earn a dollar you have to

to make a dollar

you take someone's dollar

does that kind of make sense

what I'm trying to say is

a lot of accounts

chat can someone link me an account

what was happening it's because

it's a limit of supply

a lot of people were mass buying

they owned 10% of the supply

let me ask my chat

is this basically like a stock

stock offering guys kind of a similar thing like where a company has they just they just dilute

their shares open it like you put more out there or am i missing this no it's like a reverse split

yeah but that would be consolidating okay so what i'm getting is because because i i'm i'm like a

caveman when it comes to these things um what i was trying to get at was like so basically

you know what i may be wrong i want to make sure i understand this so basically there was these

items you had to pay a lot of money for it's the end of the month you got rent to pay hold on your

mom decides to start offering blow jobs to the to the fucking neighborhood dads for 80 bucks

instead of 100 guess what she's gonna get a lot more dicks in her mouth oh god i'm so glad you

can't hear my stream right now um okay uh all right uh man i'm trying i'm trying to think i

don't want to get this wrong so so so you pay more money for these reds right but now they've

made the reds so cheap that it it basically everybody who paid more for it earlier is out

of money because now the same thing that they bought and spent a lot of money for is is

significantly

less expensive no no i'm still missing it no no get this cuck off i love i love it you gotta love

i i just want to say and i it's not on you i appreciate that your chat is is the way they

are because it reminds me of a cs lobby so i feel like i'm immersion right now yeah bro don't worry

don't worry okay let me let easy way to explain it okay do you see this random person random

chinese account he has 977 of just this skin so the past year as you can see here do you see for

the last 10 years it has

literally been this is just natural growth from from 17 all the way to 30. you get up here to get

down periods of people going on some summertime but here what has happened is that a lot of people

have entered the market especially crypto people uh in china it's one of the most uh unregulated

markets a lot of people have just mass force so as you can see in under a month it goes from 36

to 400 or 13 x okay the problem with this is the average um

the little timmy who's 16 and lives down the road in michigan right he can't buy this little skin

remember at the end of the day it's a video game right he can't buy it at 400 but he can buy it at

32 so little timmy leaves the market because he doesn't want to buy at this premium so these guys

have to liquidate and nobody is willing to buy at this peak besides these guys so it was basically

two options for the counter-strike market it was prices just keep going up and up and up

and eventually these type of people will just dump on little timmy and little timmy loses money

or it was valve make a way to fix the market and this is even though it was shit and a lot

lego underscore just resubbed for 43 months get with the times it has basically it's just changed

it okay so like exit liquidity basically there was consolidation very like the whales basically

owned all of it there was no one to sell it to panic selling happened they had to

liquidate uh on the way down and capitulated and basically it crashed i'm gonna be real i don't

understand all these crypto times that's not crypto that's just that's just financial like

the housing market did the same thing in 2008 like uh stock market in in every crash the easiest

yeah i'm trying to like uh dude loves his buzzwords no no i understand that these words are too much

for some of the guys in your chat no i i i'm not trying to like uh i i'm really really trying to

understand this because it's just it's just new to me and i understand different markets so i'm

kind of like compare something to what you understand so you can kind of like make it feel

that way um i i i but i'm not i'm just maybe i'm maybe it's just because i'm a boomer probably

because i'm a boomer i'm just not i'm not getting it like i i i feel like it's a supply demand issue

there was a there was consolidation everybody bought up a limited rare thing it caused the

price to go up because they just held there was limited amount in the market so it made the

obviously the prices go up and then what was the catalyst that caused this bro it's just the the

the past year the market has been uh just going up and up and up the easiest way i can explain

that let me try let me try and explain it one more time so the the reason why the knives were

because all the skins could be traded up to right this the knives were special it's the whole aspect

of the gold you could not get the only way you could do it was through unboxing it so as you can

see this case cost 42 this case cost 10 so all the golds from this case were worth more right

all different things but the reason why it kept going up is because you couldn't trade up to these

oh you know i i i totally get the understanding of why the value went up i'm saying what the update

how did the update what what what was the update and why did that why was that the catalyst for the

sell-off i think that's what my real question was wait wait i actually think i have the perfect

person to speak to by the way ruffle are you here there's a guy who would fully be able to explain

it like for you if that makes sense

is ruffle here to all the people over there that don't that think that i i'm stupid trying to to

figure this out it's like if you were trying to understand a a new like equities market you've

never been in the stock market before trying to understand like why your shares went up or down

i'm like legitimately trying to figure this out so i i i really appreciate you taking the time and

like i'm learning a lot while we're doing this i just don't mean i don't want to take all your

time from your stream either but no no this guy this guy can really explain it to you in like

five minutes do you have discord yeah i have discord like uh could you add me i can't add

on discord could could you can you join it like a uh server if you sent me uh if you sent me an

invite or a direct message or a call i can do it but it won't discord won't want me to add any more

people okay what's your discord code uh i'm the i'm the stock guy just literally the stock guy

yeah as much as as much as it's painful for everyone trying to listen to us exchange this

and talk about this it's actually very enlightening for me and i actually like to learn new things so

i appreciate you taking the time all good bro i added you

uh flary with uh i can i can message request oh wait how do i do a message was it me uh wait are

you understanding that wait wait never mind let me just get this guy um wait uh wait do you have

a on your stream at discord server i can just click the link join and then click on your name

yeah i it's it's the stock guy otherwise i'll i can click on yours um i don't mind doing that i

can if it's something whoops over here hold on oh okay boom give me a sec all right i'm in yours now

okay wait if you just go to like announcements you'll see me my messages i've read name okay

if you message me then i can um all right let's see report user profile okay

add friend you cannot you have maxed out your friends list okay um send me a message just call

me cool like without yeah uh all right we'll hop off of this uh this uh this this this twitch thing

okay uh and then let me uh this guy i have to you have to be friends to ask them to the group

oh hell no wait you're myself right just join the channel i can move you in all right

okay hold on babe i'm trying to figure this out i just joined this guy's subreddit so hold on

voice channel don't be a twat what does that mean oh

okay well

all the all the all the channels have gotten joined by people okay i'm in public channel too

analogy for this oh i got moved okay wait yeah yeah you're here you're here okay talk to me

so my understanding is you're i i heard this conversation two minutes ago you're

trying to understand why the market crashed instantly that's where we're at right yeah

like i understand you know market crashes from from different standpoints you know

like whether it's a tulip maybe i have a very good analogy for this so

like we can go to the diamond market yeah we can now farm diamonds inside of a lab imagine that

for the last decade of cs we've exclusively been able to mine diamonds but now instantaneously

overnight uh you're now able to farm diamonds and grow them in in a lab uh you have the immediate

price action that comes with growing diamonds instead of instead of mining them because

something that is you know impossible in nature to find or at least very rare in nature to find is

something that you can now fabricate now i guess that's what i was going to say there you go okay so

You can now manufacture that.

That's the equivalent of what's happened,

except it's happened instantaneously

rather than this being technology

that's developed over, you know, a decade.

Okay, so that's what I was asking earlier.

Yeah, like was this update just basically

it's a supply and demand issue.

Basically now that you can,

people can create their own

or whatever the reasoning was,

is it now it's just that there's just so much more of them.

So the value just instantaneously basically collapses.

I would attribute the collapse more to a confidence issue

as opposed to just a supply issue.

Okay.

So the actual supply,

it's more people's perception of,

this change is so substantial.

This is ground shaking in terms of the scale of this.

It's unprecedented.

It's the first time that Valve have made

such a unilateral decision like this.

So the consequences are, okay,

this is a huge shift in terms of what Valve is willing to do.

So it's more people's consumer confidence shifting away.

The actual increase in supply itself is less substantial.

It's more the fear of where this can go.

Although, you know,

it's a significant increase in supply,

but, but, you know,

not enough to, not enough to,

but there's an increase in five,

maybe, maybe 3% in the total number of knives

that have been added to a system.

Okay, so it's not so much the actual supply.

It's the change that Valve made

is making people lose confidence

that they might make changes like this similar

or worse changes in the future.

And therefore the confidence in the,

the holding power of the value of these skins

is, is, is basically evaporating right now.

That, but there will also be an,

the update means that,

without a doubt,

there will be an increase in supply.

If in the past there was an addition,

there's a very rare knife.

It's called a butterfly emerald.

Typically you'd expect to see maybe 15,

20 new ones exist every month.

That number is now going to be closer to maybe 30.

So a 20 to 30% increase in the additional supply every month,

but a 50% decrease in prices,

if not more,

I think it's down 70% something like that.

It's a combination of dilution and consumer confidence.

And it's being, being, being wiped out.

Yeah. Okay.

That makes sense.

Plus you also,

you also have liquidity issues where essentially this market,

um, if you sell an item,

you have to wait approximately a week to actually get the cash,

which means that a lot of buyers who sell something,

uh, don't have the cash on how to buy it for a week.

We had a liquidity crisis like this a couple of weeks back,

uh, once they added a very specific function called the trade reversal.

There's a lot that goes into this,

but, but you get the gist of it.

Yeah.

So basically,

yeah, like you said,

like, like consumer confidence,

somewhat of a dilution and then just capitulation,

just basically people that were holding on that were bag holding that are like,

Oh crap,

starting to sell.

And it's like,

Oh,

I better get out before I lose too much money,

which causes more sellers than just a race to the bottom.

Okay.

It's also worth noting that the average,

some of these knives are up,

you know,

a hundred percent in the last year.

So we are at the peak of a bull run.

And these are the,

you know,

these massive crashes in prices that are bringing us back to prices that

were,

you know,

this is what this stuff cost a year ago.

Yeah.

Okay.

All right.

So that,

that,

that,

that,

that,

that kind of,

you put it in like simple caveman terms for me.

Um,

all right.

So that,

that makes sense.

All right.

All right.

Well,

at least I understand now,

now I got to go and I got to do a whiteboard on the tulip mania crash

because I brought that up and people are asking me what that is.

So I'm going to have to whiteboard what,

what happened in the Netherlands,

uh,

500 years ago.

But no,

I really appreciate both you guys taking the time.

I,

uh,

you're going to have to,

it's a little bit more complicated than that.

It is.

I'm just saying that this is like an established market.

Don't get offended.

I wasn't comparing the two.

I said,

I brought that up earlier and somebody was asking and it gave me an idea

for my,

I like to do historical whiteboards.

Um,

no,

I,

I,

I appreciate you guys pick up the call.

I,

I called a few people that I know earlier and they just got mad at me

because I didn't even give a warning.

It's like,

Hey,

Hey,

here's a call.

And summit told me to,

I was shut up.

I'm annoying.

And Moxie said to go away cause he was busy.

So appreciate you guys taking time to,

to help,

uh,

boomer out with this.

Uh,

cause I like to understand a market before I,

I look at it and people were talking about it all morning.

So,

uh,

I didn't have an answer and I've got somewhat of understanding now.

So appreciate you guys.

If you have follow up questions,

shoot us a DM.

Yeah,

no,

for sure.

I'll,

I,

I,

I appreciate you guys like,

uh,

uh,

you know,

extending that.

Let me follow.

Um,

let me follow,

uh,

uh,

where's,

where's,

where's Flurry at?

I'm going to follow you just in case I have any more CS questions.

Hey,

I'm glad,

I'm glad I'm got,

I got the man as well to help you out.

Cause Ruff was very articulate.

Yeah,

no,

I,

yeah,

you gave me a good understanding of,

of,

of,

of the,

of kind of like the market and,

uh,

like a lot of like the,

how the market feels and like I would explain it.

And he kind of likes put it in,

like translated in my language for me.

So,

uh,

appreciate you guys giving me the,

uh,

the,

uh,

the,

the,

the rundown on that.

And,

uh,

I've been getting,

uh,

somebody,

I've been getting questions about it all day because I deal with markets like chat.

I got it.

I even got a text from my stepsister.

She's like,

Hey,

uh,

what do you think about this?

This,

uh,

this CS,

uh,

you know,

market crash.

And I'm like the CS market crash.

And so now I got these guys doing it.

So,

um,

I appreciate you guys.

Uh,

and,

uh,

I'll reach out if I have anything else and,

uh,

you know,

try not to have a heart attack,

man.

This,

uh,

the streaming thing is,

uh,

you can call it whatever you want,

but I'm,

I'm happy and I got a great relationship.

I got a hot wife.

So you can,

you can,

you can be upset and call me whatever names you want.

Doesn't affect me.

You'll be the one jacking off into a sock in 20 minutes.

I won't be,

can you guys not do those while we're doing it?

All right.

I actually,

it's all,

it's so funny when you go into a different community and if you don't immediately like

have the inside jokes or know all the knowledge,

it's like just people just go nuts.

Like fuck this guy.

This guy's a fucking onk.

This guy's a,

but I appreciate that because it lets me know that,

that,

that I'm asking the right questions.

Somebody walks up and goes,

Oh,

look at those titties.

You know,

they just made it.

So you can't convert multiple red items to gold items before you could only get

items to low chance loot boxes.

Yeah.

I kind of got that from the first thing.

My,

my thing is,

is more like,

I like to understand they were straight up calling you retarded in chat.

Well,

yeah,

but none of those people in his chat will ever know what it's like to have a

401k or be a homeowner.

So I'm,

I'm,

I'm okay with that.

Like it's,

it's just normal.

But,

but yeah,

you know,

it's,

you know,

it,

no,

but it's good to,

it's good to reach out to people.

It's good to reach out to people in different,

you know,

things like that's why I wanted to reach no offense to people in discord that

we're saying,

or in the channel that we're saying,

Hey,

listen,

can you,

can you,

you know,

let me talk about it.

Like I like to,

I like to reach out to other creators because like they have a perspective

from it,

from seeing it as a content creator as well.

And so it's,

it's nice to know that.

Plus you never know who you're going to meet and could end up doing

something with in the future or somebody you might need in the,

in the future.

When those guys are idiots,

my guy of the month,

you got rent to pay.

Your mom decides to start off,

bring blowjobs to the,

to the fucking neighborhood dads for 80 bucks instead of a hundred.

Guess what?

She's going to get a lot more dicks in her mouth.

And so,

um,

no,

I'm,

I'm fucking with his chat the same way I fuck with my chat.

If those,

if his chat saw my chat on screen,

they'd be like,

I'll be at work.

Look at these fucking boomers.

He's fucking these.

So I can make us some more tendies while she's getting dicked down by

silver hair down the street,

because that motherfucker can actually hold a conversation,

knows how to find her clit.

And isn't just talking about his fucking call of duty loot box crates,

when he's fucking taking her in his fucking Corvette,

which you call Unks got a midlife crisis.

No,

Unks got his dick in your fucking woman.

That's what I'm,

I'm black.

Holy shit.

Let me just,

um,

you guys are embarrassing.

You guys are always fucking embarrassing me.

Can we just not like,

is every Twitch streamer just unhinged today?

No,

this is me every day,

but I thought it was fun to do that.

No,

I'm not roasting his chat intentionally.

I'm saying like,

Hey,

we should round up women against their,

Oh my God,

their will tie them to fucking tables and breed them against their,

your chat is in stream is very mature and successful with 401ks and homes.

I can see by these audio alerts.

I'm assuming you came from the other guys,

uh,

from Fraley's chat.

No,

it's called inside jokes.

And the reason that they can pay $5 a pop to do this is because they have

money.

It's see,

I'm glad you showed up.

See,

if you got offended by a joke like that,

like,

maybe this isn't the community.

I,

it's funny cause over there they seem to be pretty good.

We all have jokes.

Okay.

And one thing you do when you,

when you cross over is roast each other's communities or the communities do it.

I roast my community almost as hard as they roast me.

And if you got offended by my,

my roasting,

then you're not going to be able to pay your mom decides to start offering low jobs to the fucking neighborhood.

Dad's from 80 bucks instead of a hundred.

Guess what?

I'm just going to get a lot more dicks in her mouth.

Why do you boomers get so eat one guide?

So,

easily cause it's so much,

such good content.

No,

he was actually a really nice guy.

It was,

uh,

I was,

I was really surprised.

I was surprised that a CS,

uh,

you know,

cause,

cause I,

I don't play CS,

but you know,

the,

uh,

the,

um,

you know,

the,

the,

the,

the understanding I guess,

or the reputation is that everybody's just like hopped up on Mountain Dew Adderall and just fucking just,

just dropping slurs left and right while they're like getting shot in the face and then blaming everybody else for why they're losing.

And so like when you talk to,

when you talk to somebody,

that's why it's so cool to talk to people because like,

you know,

he's like,

you could tell that he's really passionate about this.

And I love talking to people who are passionate about things,

even if I don't understand it or if it's not like something I like talking about people that are passionate about something because it just,

it makes you passionate about her.

Like you want to like,

wow,

they're really passionate about it.

Let me,

let me see why,

you know?

So that's why I like doing that.

Like if I,

if somebody would just be like,

um,

so yeah,

so just like this happened and like that happened and yeah,

it's like,

okay,

thanks.

But when somebody's passionate,

you want to hear what they have to say.

He's,

he's not going to get you more viewers.

You don't have to glaze him like that,

bro.

I'm not glazing anybody.

I y'all,

y'all,

y'all are fucking trolls.

I love you.

God damn.

You guys are assholes.

Uh,

is there an AI bubble?

Yes,

please.

With the police stop guys,

but there's also a stock market bubble.

There's also a,

a,

there's a lot of bubbles,

but bubbles can keep growing and sometimes bubbles pop.

Sometimes they let a little air out.

Sometimes the bubble moves into another one.

All right,

ladies,

you know what I'm talking about?

You ever had a fart that,

that traveled up into in your vagina and you got a queef out of it.

Okay.

You know what I'm talking about?

You,

a bubbles can,

so my God,

the worst part about that is not that it's me that said that.

It's that every time it comes on,

the women in chat start putting the bubbles.

But now I found out that Walmart supports the local KKK.

And you know what?

I,

I,

I'm,

I'm,

I'm a Walmarter for life.

Now,

you know,

something I only get my tide pods to bleach or my bleach pods to,

to clean my,

my hood at Walmart,

not that fucking pansy target shit.

All right.

Even my wife don't shop there.

Ain't no way I'm getting bleached for my,

my hood at the same place.

They selling rainbow flags to kids.

All right.

First of all,

this is all AI generated.

I never said this.

And second of all,

I'm glad these burps blurbs are actually playing because if there is anybody new here,

and I'm taking it,

I'm taking it.

I'm like that fish who just loves to get hooked.

Oh God.

Hey,

Hey,

Billy,

don't,

that's all that.

That worm isn't real.

It's on a hook.

Oh,

I know.

Oh,

take me daddy.

Like I'm,

I,

that's who I am right now.

You know,

like I'm that fucking sadomasochist fucking,

you know,

submissive fucking fish.

You just love to get hooked and get out of the water.

Like,

Oh,

pull it out of my mouth.

You know,

we get a bunch of people that hear me and,

and say,

Oh,

the stock guy.

Oh,

he's talking about stocks and equities.

I'm really curious to where's my food.

You know,

like this floor is dirty.

Why are the kids not in bed?

My stomach's empty in my sacks full.

Who the fuck?

Okay.

So like people say,

Oh,

the stock and there's a person on Twitch does stocks.

I'm curious to see if this guy actually talks about it.

And like,

if I can learn something about it,

let me go check him out because he's talking about stuff that I want to learn about because I'm getting there.

Hey,

let me go check out a stream.

All right guys,

let's get into some of the economic data,

the tariffs.

And then it's just this for 10 minutes,

which I think is my dick.

And if I get the chance,

he's going to kiss my dick,

kiss my dick.

kiss my dick.

kiss my dick.

And if I get the chance,

he's going to.

Now,

these people,

you're going to be wondering why in 10 years,

Jason,

dad,

street,

DJ,

try to relax your anus,

whatever.

That's not what I am.

I'm not going to let that define you.

Why do?

And so now these people in 10 years,

you're gonna be wondering why didn't these people invest?

Why didn't they get good with their money?

They could have,

they could have been successful.

They could have been smart with their money.

Learned about budgeting and about,

about debt and about interest and about all this other stuff,

but they didn't all because y'all threw a bunch of fucking shit.

And,

and,

and,

and,

and,

and never,

never,

you know,

I'm not trying to like pull anybody's,

you know,

whatever,

but did everyone get in the same lending?

Call call.

We got to weed out the week.

Yes,

ma'am.

You're right.

Don't shame people for the avocado toast.

I always think that's the dumbest shit ever.

Like I did do a video about like,

if you were to save 10 bucks a month and just invest it,

you know,

on,

on SMP,

how much that would be over time.

But anybody who tells you that you're not gonna be able to buy a house or not be able to retire because you buy fucking avocado toast or get a coffee is so full of shit.

Like,

don't listen to that person.

Yes,

it could help give you more over time,

but that's not the difference between you retiring and working at a fucking Home Depot greeter until someone shoves you and gives you a fucking brain damage and kills you while they're stealing like,

you know,

lawn care shit on the way out.

Like that's,

that's not,

that's not what is it?

It's just such a dumb,

fucking thing.

I hate.

Are you still knows beyond me puts?

No,

I sold for 25% everybody.

Hold on everybody.

Everybody.

I need y'all to stop right now.

I just want,

you know,

I voted for Trump and you goddamn blue haired fucking liberal snowflakes.

Every goddamn one of y'all going to hell and I hope y'all get deported.

All right,

fuck y'all.

That's that's sad.

That's satire.

Thank you.

This is so funny.

Don't please don't are you still in QS calls?

I never took calls.

I was in shares and the last of my shares got stopped out at 1510.

I'm crying.

I'm sorry whiteboard on tulips or marbles pick one old man.

Okay.

Can you not yell at me?

All right.

Do I take GPS again?

Okay.

I can't even fucking do this shit right now.

I can't believe these are your actual views and opinion streamer.

This guy seems so pleasant.

Like he's had a super easy life from all the money.

He's made on stocks.

Can you hear the satire?

Hello?

First time chatter.

You are correct.

I have I've had a very easy life.

And it's not my fault.

You were born poor.

Okay, I come from a long line of people who are smart with their money and build businesses and and utilized labor and it is what it is.

You know, I mean, you know, it's not my fault.

You were born you hit the fucking you lost on that gamble.

I was born into wealth and privilege and because of that, I'm actually 67 years old right now.

But I fly to South America once a month and go to an orphanage and pick out who I need a transfusion from.

Okay, stem cells are what I eat for breakfast.

Okay.

I have three organs that are so impressive.

Somebody that are 50s.

How about you fucking suck this dick?

That's what you need to do.

All right.

That's what you need to do.

Okay.

All right.

This ain't a 50 year old dick.

That's going to be fucking bouncing on your tonsils.

All right, these nuts aren't going to be hanging off your chin.

They're gonna be rubbing real good on those fucking.

Dimples.

Okay, this shit works.

How about you?

Shut up and let me fucking talk pussy.

Can I be honest with you?

If anybody from that community did switch over and say, I'll check him out another day.

What your time and your progress is worth every penny.

So get 60% off of the year.

Use code stock.

I exclamation point.

Cognizant.

I got you ladies and gentlemen.

All right, we're talking about it right here.

It's relevant.

Hell and Cognizant could have kept some people off the Epstein list.

Oh my God.

I'll stock you.

I'm learning so much from your stream in the past few minutes.

I don't even know what to fucking do.

I'm listening to you outside at my truck cleaning.

My neighbor is hearing all of this.

I'm new here.

Do you only trade stocks?

Do you have any long-term investments?

Uh, 90% of my money is long-term investments.

You don't trade stocks to make money.

You use the market to grow money, not make money.

I day trade with some money because it's fun.

I swing trade with a larger amount of money, but you have a car outside.

Okay, it is a white Corolla.

What year is immortal?

2006.

Thank you better.

That is what I was wondering.

Let's just do marbles and then I'm going to get to the news.

Remind me.

Never ever ever to do.

Do a crossover.

You seem like a serious stock streamer.

Why the fuck would a serious stock?

You just pissed off because your girlfriend calls me long schlong silver.

If you want serious stock streamers, there's none because nobody watches them.

You go watch CNBC.

If you want, maybe that'll help.

Dude, you don't you don't stream to a large audience.

If all you do is go.

Well today we're looking at QS on that's the 200-day moving.

Average appears to be bouncing off later this evening.

Trump has an announcement potentially related to the quantum announcement from the White House yesterday.

No, you want to hear all right motherfuckers.

Looks like the White House is doing some fucking shady shit again.

All right.

I don't know what's going on, but they said they want to stake in quantum computing first.

They did Intel then you did rare-earths.

Now they're moving on to this.

All right, Quantum's escape.

Fuck it.

They had a you know, a pretty decent earnings and they said they got a cash runway 12.8 billion dollar, you know, 12.8 million dollar subscription service and you know what they have quantum in the name probably gonna get some retail.

If it flies, floats, or fucks you rent it, don't buy it, okay?

Stocky, women are not things.

Those are not.

Okay, you know what?

I'm not about to.

All three of those things are designed to suck you dry.

And so that's what I did this morning.

I even said quantum.

Quantum scape isn't even quantum computing, but it has quantum in the name.

They had a good catalyst on their news this morning.

And you've got the whole thing with Trump and the administration want to take quantum stock, you know, stakes and their government's trying to do that shit.

And then there's an announcement at 3 which might be about quantum.

Fuck it.

I'm going to run this.

I bought in pre-market average down at open and sold for a Billy big fucking game.

That's how I talk.

That's how I talk.

If you again, I'm not here to do whatever but I can't talk the other way because that's that's that's that's that's just boring and it's the old way of doing it.

If a dick joke makes you think somebody doesn't understand the economy or finance then then I don't know what to do.

This ain't your dad's stock show.

But back to what I was saying.

Wow, we really got off topic all because somebody asked me about the fucking CS skins.

You're here to entertain us.

You're damn right.

So then you think it's a fake story because your dad never played with you.

I am so fucking toxic.

I'm taking my shirt off at the end of stream.

Like I always do W collabs lately.

I love collabing with other people.

It's so much fun because I get to learn so much like like people like when I asked what are you talking about?

When how do you people have so much money?

Hey, hey, don't sew it, you know, don't sew it all the way closed.

He goes why I said it's fourth hole Friday doc.

Oh my God.

They sold the top of the skin market.

Okay from your Apple calls on the news QS weeklies London Club calls overnights.

You took us calls to small dick energy for fuck's sake.

Damn you had so much time to drop a fucking roast on me and that's what you came up with.

You had all that time to fucking type something out and that's like you brother you regroup come back tomorrow.

All right marbles and then I wanted to run down route.

We need to talk about a few things number one national debt.

We're talking about bitch, you know, like this floor is dirty.

Why are the kids not in bed?

My stomach's empty in my sex full.

I'm going to viewers you game from cold calling cs2.

Yeah, no, we that was combined.

I had the same hopes and aspirations that your parents had for you just male and both of us are disappointed.

She just starts chewing his neck and bite can't fault us for having what he doesn't stop because you could see his he's smiling.

He's like worth it.

That must be some good.

Mantis us yourself stop for a second.

There's a serious comment chat.

Hey stock.

I buried I buried my dad last week.

I'm finding out that he may have another child that he was shelling out thousands of dollars to but he gave me shit.

He didn't give you anything.

Huh?

This is bait is absolutely fucking bait and I'm taking it.

I'm taking it.

I'm like that fish who just loves to get hooked.

Oh God.

Hey, hey Billy.

Don't that's all that worm isn't real.

It's on a hook.

Oh, I know.

Oh, take me daddy.

Like I'm that's who I am right now, you know, like I'm that fucking sadomasochist fucking, you know, submissive fucking fish.

You just love to get hooked and get out of the water like I'll pull it out of my mouth.

Oh, throw me in you dirty man.

I'm so all right.

Here's what we're going to do.

I love that.

You guys are throwing money at me for no reason, but we need to stop because we're never going to be the rest of the show today and I would rather get through my show than than than make money off of this.

So,

I am going to do marbles now and then we're going to come back and we're going to reset.

Okay, we're going to reset beyond me.

It might be trying to go again.

Well, good luck man.

I made my money on the up and down on that.

I'm done.

Okay.

All right, because I want to talk about the national debt hitting 38 trillion.

I want to hit the talk about the Louvre.

I want to talk about the tinder making you do face face scans.

Now Federal Reserve losing access to the ADP private enrollment data Trump telling ranchers that they don't understand how much he's helped them.

The SEC chair want to talk about important employer-advided health care and a few other stories as well as why AWS the AWS crashed cause smart beds that were worth over $2,000 to overheat and get stuck upright.

So yeah, let's let's get to let's let's let's do it.

Let's let's get going and let's run it.

Okay, about this on a dick pic for the tinder face recognize.

Okay.

All right, let's do it.

Let's do marbles real quick and then we're going to get back to it.

All right.

Oh my God.

It's already 12.

What?

How is it already 12?

Okay, let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go.

Let's go get it get it get it get it getting you blacked out for an hour.

I did not blend out for an hour.

You spend an hour learning about video game skins.

You guys didn't find it interesting.

Let's go.

Let's go get in get in get in get in get in get in get in get in get in.

Now and we're going to be right back from this.

Okay.

All right, let's run it.

I could have I could have paid to join morning call.

But instead I blurt four times.

All right, tetanus.

Congratulations on another win.

You know, the FBI is not investigating.

Are you taking Ford calls?

You have some of your shares.

No, of course.

I saw my shares and all my dividends that I've gotten from them.

It's been beautiful.

All right.

Owls has been fun the past couple days.

Okay.

All right, let's turn this off and then get.

To it.

All right.

So, um, by announce founder got pardoned by Trump.

Everyone's getting pardoned by Trump.

Everyone because he knows that these people are going to make him money afterwards.

This is or somebody somebody's going to get inside something.

This is how this works.

It's bullshit, but it's how it works.

This is this is how political corruption works.

They they do this.

Why do you think so many Congress people leave Congress and end up working for like Raytheon and LMT and JP Morgan and shit like that?

It's just that's how this works.

That's just unfortunately how this shit works.

There's a lot of girls that have.

Bro, come on.

Outro or Audi labia and it can stretch a lot.

I don't know what videos you watch, but I've seen him stretch pretty far.

Call him bat wings.

Daniela.

Can you not encourage them?

Finance chicks are the worst.

Why stocks go up today?

I shorted.

We're in a bull market, man.

It's five billion dollars a day going into the market from retail alone.

Five billion from CTA.

People are buying the dips.

There's money on the sidelines.

I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I don't know what to tell you, man.

We're not in a bull or bear market.

We're in a kangaroo market, right?

So.

So basically, you know, there's there's there's three types of markets.

These are the type of markets when you make a lot of money, you buy the dips,

you sell the rips, right?

And that's why you sell the rips.

So you have capital on the sidelines in case you in case, you know, the dip

happen or if you're taking it like on the rip and you take that money put it

in your Divi's when the market kind of cools off Divi's go up right and balance

your portfolio yesterday Divi stocks were green even though the market was red.

So again, you know, you have your your bull market.

You have your bear market and then you have your kangaroo market.

Okay, this is what it is.

And the best thing you can do is just dollar cost average and forget about it.

Or if you want to be active in it set yourself by levels like like for example, NNE.

I was buying every two dollars and fifty cents down right when it hit 50 bucks.

So I bought it 4750.

Okay, and then I bought again at 45 and then at 42 540.

And then again at 37 5.

Okay, and now today we've already we've already got stop losses set for these

and NNE's at 41.

So now the shares I bought here and here are already in the green.

So once it goes above 40, I set my stop loss on these.

So if it stops out, I automatically make money on this entry.

If it falls back down, I have money and profit to buy that same entry again.

If it goes above 42 5, I set a stop loss for the shares.

I bought at 40 and I do the same thing.

I buy the dips and sell the rips.

And if it falls down again, the money that I made selling on the way up,

I can now buy on the way down to 50 again.

And if it doesn't I got capital on the sidelines to buy something else.

It's on the dip.

So I like to buy the dips sell the rips kind of thing in this market.

That's just me.

Obviously, you know, you're taking a chance that it's not going to keep dipping

or that it is going to rip up.

It's obviously more risky, but that's how I play this market.

Okay, that's how I do that.

How do you do that?

How do you do that in TOS?

It's not hard.

If I bought 10 shares yesterday at 37 5 and it's at 41 right now.

I said a trailing stop loss of 10 shares at two and a half percent or three

percent, which is right at 40 bucks, which means if it falls there, I stop

out for a profit on those and if it doesn't and it keeps going up then I can

do the same thing with the next batch of 10 shares when it gets above 42 5.

So I should sell my enemy from yesterday.

Lol.

No, you can put a bigger stop loss if you want.

I'm telling you how I do it.

I have my original 100 shares of enemy that I got it.

15.

Bucks that I'm never going to sell.

This is just the the trading capital the swing trading capital.

It doesn't tell you let you select which shares you want to sell doesn't matter

which shares you sell.

Stop worrying about the the percentage and and that you look at the value gain.

If you if you bought 10 shares here and 10 shares here and you sell these 10

shares.

Sure.

These 10 shares were sold at a loss, but these 10 shares are up and if you keep

doing that, it doesn't really matter.

You're talking about your cost basis average.

Your cost basis average doesn't matter.

Are you talking about your tax lots?

Well, I mean it depends on if you're doing if you're if you're wash sale matters.

It depends on I mean how much you're paying at the end of the year.

You can set it to first in first out or what I like to do is last in first out.

That's what I like to do.

If you trade a lot if you're able to do last in first out that's usually the best

for tax lots because you're trading a lot of up and down up and down and so you're

going to you're going to you're going to do that rather than doing first in first

out or first in last out.

What about long-term versus short-term gain tax?

Why do you have to worry about your long-term gain tax right now?

That's that's down the line short-term.

You're probably not going to have to own any taxes this year.

But if you do they literally automate that shit for you.

Now, you should get a statement at the end of the year and the last page basically

gives you total losses total wins wash sale allocations or whatever and you type

that in or you give it to your CPA.

I mean everybody's individually here.

Okay.

What if I don't have any money then let's go fucking rob a museum.

We're going to do that too soon.

They opened up today.

What about the?

Three pattern day trade rule.

Well, if you have a cash account, you can do a subtle cash.

And if you have over 25,000 your margin account, you don't have to worry about that.

Everybody's different.

Listen, the Lou just opened back up.

All right.

I don't know how anybody's not aware about this.

Okay.

This is insane.

This just goes to this just goes to show you.

Okay.

How the fuck does one get into trading a crippling gambling addiction and time?

Okay.

All right.

No, but seriously, here you go for those.

You guys.

Aren't aware the fucking Lou right that not the Lou that you go to the bathroom in.

Okay, you fucking you fucking British you guys have four months until the sun sets on your Empire for the first time in 600 years.

I have it marked on my calendar in four months or five months.

The sun will set on the British Empire for the first time in 600 years.

I think it's hilarious, but whatever.

All right.

So for those of you guys who are unaware, it's that it's that museum in France, right?

Like with all the with all the fucking paintings and shit, right?

Like Mona Lisa, which was stolen.

And.

Then returned, you know, the one from DaVinci Code with the big fucking Illuminati pyramid out front, you know, that one.

All right, that one.

All right.

So for those who are unaware, there was a heist that took place last week and it was kind of under wraps for a couple days.

But like it didn't really get out into the into the, you know, mainstream media because like there was other stories that were going on.

But just so you guys are aware.

This is what's hilarious.

Okay, so it's.

It's how simple it was.

I think is the most insane thing.

All right.

No, not Mona's ass dumbass.

No, we're not taking it for them.

Moaning Lisa.

No.

All right.

All right, whatever.

So for those who are unaware, so you've got this big-ass Museum, right?

You have this big-ass Museum multiple floors.

Okay, balconies and shit like this.

And this is this is the loop, right?

It's this it's this giant Museum.

It's got all these different things.

There's a there's entrance over here, whatever.

So what happens is is a bunch of guys.

Guys get a truck, right?

They get a big truck with a crane on it, right?

One of those big like crane operator trucks, right?

And they get it and they park it over here.

Now, this is how ingenious this was.

Okay, they basically okay for those of you guys who are unaware of what happened.

All right, they basically get a fucking remember how I told you if you put on a hard hat and a vest you can go anywhere.

I told you guys this a few weeks ago and how I actually went and helped out with the hurricane.

Recovery because I had a hard hat and a vest on and I had my gear with me and the cops that shut off the beach were like, yeah, sure.

Go talk to the other, you know, the other agency or whatever.

And like I just was out there for two days like helping get people out of houses and shit like that.

All because I wore that if you were a hard hat and a vest you can do almost anything in public.

People are too fucking scared to say anything or ask any questions and and who's going to who's going to you know, like what do you do?

Nobody even knows how to tell if you're real or not.

Okay.

I put up cones on a street with my friends in high school and watch this traffic backed up for like 20 minutes.

If we were idiots, but it worked.

Okay.

All right.

Where were you a few days ago?

I was in I was in San Diego.

Okay.

So these guys get hard hats and reflective vests.

They get a truck with a crane which you can fucking rent from Home Depot or it over there.

I don't they call them over there who me da poo or something.

I don't know.

So so so they go there and they put it up on the second floor balcony.

The crazy thing was.

Is that there's cameras out there, but the cameras are facing this way.

So they drive up nobody questions.

They must be doing construction over at the loo, right?

Okay, and they go over there and they get on the second about floor balcony and they get grinders, right?

They get those machines with like the the spin right here, right?

Those little like those little steel grinders or whatever.

They cut off the lock and they just go through the second the second floor balcony.

The alarm didn't trip until they went through here.

They then walk down the hallway.

Okay, and inside there's all these little like cases with like crown jewels and shit.

All right, and they walk through here with their hard hats and their grinders.

And they basically tell because they don't believe in guns over there.

They tell the security guards.

They hold them hostage with grinders to the neck.

Okay, they take the grinders.

They put it up to them and they say and they say, you know, don't move.

Oh, we will.

Cut you and they and the security guards were like I surrender and they're like good and so they hold the guards hostage with these grinders.

They then walk over here and just start fucking grinding away at the at the locks open these up get the jewels and walk out and they got fucking jewels from from like the like the Empress and shit like that.

They got like all these giant necklaces and stuff.

Although.

Although one of those dudes is going to be found dead and I'm going to tell you why here was their Grand Escape.

They had little fucking those little fucking Vespas and shit.

It took them seven minutes to go from here here and out to the little fucking Vespas, which they're French.

They're probably two to a Vespa.

Okay, and you got to hold his waist and just fucking Vespas out.

Okay, pulled a hole pulled a hole and this is how.

My hot Hattie's on here.

We we okay, and so they just fucking booked it.

It took seven minutes.

It took them four minutes to go from here to here three minutes out seven minutes.

Now they did fuck up though.

Someone dropped a hard hat and gloves.

The French authorities are saying they found traces of DNA in there doubt it.

But you know, I mean, how do you test the DNA of a hair follicle of a Frenchman?

You need soon as you fucking test the data.

It's just like nicotine.

And wine like that's it.

Okay, and baguette.

Okay, like like like that doesn't really narrow it down.

Like fucking CSI is going to be like I put it through the the Max Mastro the Maestro strometer and it's it's a fucking it came back is 90% of the population.

But one guy fucked up one guy fucked up.

He dropped a crown.

How do you drop the crown?

Dude drop the crown on the way out.

Like he got the empress.

His tiara.

They got natural pearls.

They got the the the the stones from the Empress Eugene.

They got all of that, but they dropped the crown seven minutes.

No shit.

He dropped the crown motherfucker.

He could have taken off the hard hat and put the crown on.

How do you drop the crown?

Wasn't it the same weekend as the no Kings protest?

Okay, you're not funny little bro.

The visual is hilarious.

Okay, I'm not here for that.

He was he's French.

He didn't have the strength to carry it fair.

Now this is but this is what happened.

Like like they literally went in there took a day if you I have said it before and I'll say it again.

If you wear a hard hat and a vest and I have both of them outside you can get away with anything.

I don't know what it is.

I think it's just as a society.

We have been conditioned that that if there's construction you don't get in the way because you don't want to get hurt or you don't want to get in trouble or you slow down or whatever.

You can wear a hard hat and a somebody asked me at twitchcon.

They said my buddy has apartments.

And he offered me to stay in his apartment so I could have a place to stay but it they're all full right now.

He has to wait for somebody to move out.

What do I do?

And I said, I mean you didn't hear this from me.

But if you go buy a hard hat and a vest go knock on the door of one of the families tell them that you're from the city.

You're there to inspect just for a second to make sure there's no black mold or some some fucking could do whatever you go in there.

You take a bag of weed you put it somewhere in the house you leave you then call the authorities and anonymously say.

That your kid was at this house and they tried to sell them weed.

You know what I mean?

And next thing you know, you have an empty apartment again.

I'm not saying that that's a good thing should never do something like that.

But but you know what I'm saying is is is is a hard hat and a vest will literally get you anywhere and do anything.

It's insane.

Nobody's going to question it now.

Could this be a false flag?

Damn right.

It could be.

This is just one step that they're going to use for facial recognition.

I'm telling you right now that this is this is all a plot by the Illuminati.

You think that the you think that the the pyramid at the front of the Louvre is just for design?

No, it's the Illuminati.

And this is the next step RFID everywhere RFID to get everywhere scanned video surveillance.

We're going to save we're going to save our nation first.

It's a crown next at your children.

All right, they're going to come for you.

They're not they're not going to they're not going to stop.

I'm telling you now.

This is all part of their plan.

You thought it was a joke.

Look what they're doing with.

Match.com right now with tinder ladies and gentlemen.

This is a real story.

This is a real mainstream story.

Tinder has stated.

They are now going to require all us users to use face scans.

That's right.

Bill Gates was we told you about Bill Gates years ago.

We I'm telling you we tried to tell you we tried to warn you but the sheeple don't listen.

Okay, this is an actual headline right now.

All new users will have in order.

To get a tinder account.

You are going to have to upload a facial recognition scan.

They're here, but you're too busy worried about other shit like six seven.

I'm sorry Gen Z that you didn't get to have something as cool as six nine.

Okay, cool.

Six seven you suck.

You're idiots.

Six seven is a psyop.

The CIA started it by with a rapper just to get these kids.

So they won't pay attention to the real shit that's going on right now.

Don't be fooled decalcify your third eye.

Buy my supplements decalcify your third leg stock.

I supplements the sorry sorry stock supple stock guy.com.

That's right supple stocky.com.

That's where you're going to get your supplements right there.

I know you're joking but is the tinder thing real?

Yes, if you were in the morning call this morning, you would be aware that tinder match group.

The parent company of tinder has announced that in the that all us all new us users will have to use facial identification.

For profiles.

Why do you have your boobs out like that go out in the sun for 15 minutes.

Eat your food drink your juice go out in the sun for 15 minutes.

And if I do if I'm a good boy, what do I get whatever I want?

You're lying.

I want that on paper.

That's weaponizing sex.

This is 2025 your butthole going to see the sunlight.

Okay.

All right.

Just stream outside curry cannons going crazy today.

Now.

I understand why you can't be a college professor.

Listen teaching somebody via humor is the best way to teach them inappropriate jokes and actual humor and funny shit is the best way to teach people.

Somebody actually learned about the Lou thing.

Somebody probably learned about the tinder thing all because I went from what was I even talking about to begin with somebody that was actually living in a bad financial situation.

We ended up in the loo.

We ended up in like how to evict people and get a rent from your buddy to how to do a heist to you know,

Feminine French guys on Vespas to

Alex Jones to tinder and now,

you know about a lot of different things.

I learned about the hardhat thing.

Someone's dad died and didn't leave them anything.

Oh, that's how this started.

Yeah.

So to my chatter whose father passed away and your unknown sibling that's getting the money.

Obviously an estate lawyer is probably going to be the most most effective route for you.

If

if if you if you had a large estate,

I don't know if you want to deal with that with courts and stuff like that.

But otherwise,

you know,

you know,

I don't know.

There's a lot of personal information there.

I don't know.

I wouldn't one thing.

The only thing I'll say I'll say is don't be upset or bitter at that individual because they probably didn't know about you or had no idea that you weren't also receiving it.

So don't take out your father's bullshit on somebody that didn't that you know was potentially,

you know,

you know not had no idea what's going on.

Don't hold that anger and resentment to somebody especially if you don't know I know it's difficult to do that.

But but you know,

he may not know about you.

And if he does,

he may think that you are also getting,

you know,

support or something like that.

I seriously doubt they plotted against you.

That's the kind of shit.

So a lot of people hold resentment without understanding that was not like 60 minutes ago.

That guy already left stream and is headed to his siblings house.

Okay,

bro.

This is why I can't explain to new people what you do on your stream or what you talk about.

Should I get into stocks or just drop the balls into Plinko?

Well,

the difference is you just keep buying the stock market and forgetting about it.

Eventually,

it'll just keep going up with Plinko.

Plinko every time for every one time you win big,

you'll lose big three times.

Eventually you go bankrupt and then you look back and say man,

if I just took all the money put in the market forgot about it.

I'd be rich.

San Francisco Mayor says Trump is calling off federal deployment.

That's nice.

Is gpus another buy here soon.

I just bought it at 36 cents because every time it gets to 36 or dips under 36,

then it ends up running to 38 39 40.

Of course,

eventually it's going to go to zero.

So remember that but what if the next Plinko is 1000x we have we've traded and bought it.

And been in 20 stocks just in the past four months that went between 200 and a thousand percent or more.

There's always one out there.

The difference is with Plinko.

It's one shot 50 50 with this.

It can go up and then come down.

You play it again.

You can average down.

You can cut it.

You really drop the ball on that collab earlier.

What collab with the CS guy?

No, we had a great conversation.

Plinko can get you 1000x in one shot.

A lottery can get you 400 million x in one shot.

I mean,

there's always that thing.

You were talking about four skins.

No,

honestly,

you're getting better at talking to people stocky.

I'm trying to it's not that I'm changing like who I am or what I do.

It's just it's just it's why I go back and watch all my streams every night because I like to see like what hit what missed and what I can like what I did right what I did wrong.

And also I learn a lot of shit from you guys.

I can't tell you that but like a lot of times I learn shit from you guys.

Like I'll talk about a subject and think that I'm doing gut well on it and then realize.

I go back and reach at realize I was off on something or I had wrong information and then I go check on it.

Make sure I have it right for the next time.

I can't believe you snuck in a stepsister.

Wait,

I did.

When did I do it?

Oh at the end.

Yeah,

when I said my stepsister texted me about about skins or something like that.

Are you still in Rivian long-term?

Yep.

I've been trading it up and down.

But yeah,

I'm still in long-term.

Crazy thing is is that oh damn NNE coming back big today.

Do you watch any youtubers for economics and market news?

Not really because I don't have a lot of time to do it.

And by the.

Time their videos come out edited the news has changed or it's already something I've learned about in real time.

I do like economics explained.

I think he's good for like road trips and stuff because he just talks about complex subject and he's like kind of fun to listen to and you never know.

Like I learned stats about other countries or I write it down or I think about it and then I go back and research it for myself to kind of make sure that I have the right information.

I always like to fact-check fact-check things.

How many works is good?

Do you have a CFA ever been tempted to get it?

No, I don't want to be licensed in any way.

I'm an entertainer.

That's what I am.

I am not a savant.

I'm not a quant.

I'm not some fucking Market Wizard or some economics guy.

I just I'm an entertainer and people say well, you should get you could usually get certified.

You should get a license.

Then you'll get more credibility credibility for what you think getting a fucking license gives you credibility.

I would much rather talk to somebody who's been in the market for 20 years than somebody who just got their fucking Traders license, right?

It's a big difference between something in a book and doing it at and getting.

Experience in it, right?

It's why I'm able to be calm cool and collected and buy things and understand but more importantly the moment I do that.

I can't say and do the shit that I do now.

I can literally come out here and say buy that stock you stupid pussy bitch.

That's right broke boy.

That's right empty your bank account sell your fucking your long-term shit.

Okay, your kid doesn't need a 529 when we're going to the fucking moon by that fucking stupid meme stock.

And if you do it and then lose all your fucking money, I can laugh at you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

What the fuck are you going to do about it?

You're going to sue me.

Yeah, some Twitch streamer some some guy on Twitch with a that looks like he lives in a trailer with a dead body behind him told me to buy this.

I lost my money.

You think you're going to fucking hear your case?

No, I'm not a financial advisor.

I'm not a fucking license anything now.

Obviously I wouldn't do that.

But I'm saying like I can make jokes.

I can talk about this stuff.

If I'm licensed.

I'm restricted in what I say.

I can't talk freely.

I can't make certain jokes.

I can't make certain, you know opinions about things.

I have to be that so I gain nothing and lose.

Everything.

Yeah, but there's three people out there who will think you're more serious and where you think that that's what makes me what be because someone drops a dick joke there.

They're not credible.

No, you're uptight loser and you're going to fucking listen to old heads forever until you realize you didn't get with the market.

This is the new way.

It is right.

It just is what it is.

You know, I mean, it's why you listen to newer things.

You watch newer things.

You don't go home and watch black and white movies, right?

You watch the newest shit.

It's just the way it is a new graphics new things.

It is what it is.

I'm not some fucking expert.

I'm an idiot with a camera.

Sure.

I get right sometimes.

Sure.

I have I'm good at explaining things whatever but I'm I should be one tool in your tool bag of knowledge information investing whatever, right?

Don't write me off completely because I've got I feel like I've got some things that are, you know, very few things that are there.

They're helpful, but also don't utilize me as your only source of information because I have, you know, even though I try to be as you know, direct and informational as possible.

I still have biases and sometimes I you know, I look at we can look at the same set of data and come to two different conclusions.

So no, I'm not going to get certified or licensed.

There's no reason for me to unless some fucking hedge firm is like a hedge fund is like, hey, we want to hire you.

We are going to pay you an ungodly amount of money to come work for us.

Not because we want you to do anything.

We don't want you anywhere near a stock.

You dipshit.

We don't want you to fucking touch a stock with a 10-foot pole.

You will have nothing to do with any decisions that are made here.

But we know that you could bring in 10 times your salary in in new investors into our fund if you're attached to it.

But then I have restrictions as well.

Stay humble stocky.

It's not that I'm humble.

It's just that I don't I don't I'm honest.

I think it's not humble.

It's honesty.

I think, you know, understanding that you're not special.

You're not an expert.

If you the moment someone thinks they're an expert, you need to get rid of their credibility.

Okay, when somebody thinks that they know everything about something and they're an expert on it.

Don't that boom because that's somebody who doesn't evolve with the market and doesn't understand one of the biggest criticisms.

I get when I do my ask me anything about money thing and somebody asked me and they asked me a question and I say, well, you know, I just don't know.

I that your question the way you ask it.

I just don't know.

Here's what I think will happen based on this, but I can't I can't say this is what's going to happen and there's the you can always tell the people who are younger.

They'll say fuck it who says I don't know.

Why would I ask?

Why would I listen to somebody who doesn't know go on listen to everybody who tells you they know the answer to everything see where that gets you.

Do you jerk off to these ideas when in bed?

No, no, I usually jerk off to shit that I have to use a VPN and it's only title in Russian.

You know what?

Um,

I I didn't need to answer that.

I really didn't need to answer that because you were supposed to insult the chatter for saying that I don't insult everybody is the VPN sponsor coming in right now.

No, I knew he was a spy.

Speaking of which there's two articles today that I was talking about this morning during the morning call and one of them was here.

It was talking about this.

If you guys but if you guys want to read an interesting article, it's in stockies daily news, but no right here.

Oh wait, no, no, not that one.

Here it is right this one.

Female spies are waging sex warfare to steal Silicon Valley secrets.

And this has been going on for a while, but it's really happening now.

And these aren't like they're no longer using people that are trained as spies.

They're not even using that anymore.

They're getting people to literally come over here and marry and have kids and whatever and and spend years doing this.

Okay.

I'm sure you guys have heard about honey traps before.

The strongest weapon against us nerds is women who are six out of ten.

Wait, I have a chance.

So Russia and China have the most and they come over here and they literally come here meet somebody.

That's a target marry them have kids with them collect information for years.

It's wild Klaus flag flag ball a resident of China tried to sell intellectual property.

He had stolen from Tesla to undercover agents in Las Vegas.

For 15 million.

It's wild.

But the reason that I brought this up was it got me thinking what would a International spy?

What would a woman at the International spy or being hired as a spy look like right?

You see all those things where it's like the picture of of you know,

I saw it earlier today when we were talking about it and our first lady.

No, she's too pretty cash Patel.

The pretty ones are not the ones because it can't be too pretty because then it's it's a stock.

He's about to go on his misogyny rant of the day.

No, what does it say?

Apparently the Chinese guy would tuck it in during intimate moments with the lights always turned off.

What the fuck guys?

Come on.

It's not what I was looking for.

It was the other one but this has become a real thing and I know people gonna be like,

oh, well, that's just normal.

It's happened all the time or why are you only focusing on this or not?

But like what is this?

Oh husband, you were never supposed to figure out.

I was trying to spy.

You're too smart.

I love you.

Bye.

No, okay.

Here it is right here.

The last thing you see before leaking state secrets.

Now I was laughing about this this morning and thinking, oh, well, what do they look like?

You know, whatever it's got to be, you know, they say that they got to be a 6 out of 10,

you know, to be the right one and I was thinking well, we're only talking about country

and then I looked at something I said wait a second

and I went and looked at my wife's LinkedIn profile picture that she's had from when I met her.

6 out of 10 got the look working in there.

And why?

Why did she date me?

She looks like she's going through the MySpace fucking emo phase,

but you don't have state secrets.

I mean, I did work in an underground nuclear facility that held the largest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the entire world.

But that was years ago.

Why make trillions when we could make billions?

Stocki, I got bailed out on my N and E calls today.

Oh, really? I'm chilling here.

What are we doing with Capital One?

Oh, I haven't looked at Capital One today. That poor woman, bless her soul.

Let me take a look here.

Capital One, Capital One.

I'm down on it, but I ain't scared.

It's been one day little bro.

I got until Monday.

Any stock market course you recommend?

No, there's no course on the stock market.

There are, there are, you know, understanding the stock market,

but you don't need a course for that.

It's free information.

I mean shit, you'll learn more about the market sitting here with us,

hanging out with us or in our Discord chatting around

and you will ever on some fucking course that you pay money for.

If you go into our Discord at the top where it says stock market,

begin it for beginners.

There's two GitHub links that send you to everything you need to know

across the market for free.

With all due respect, sir, your wife got hotter.

Lucky man, and I got wealthier.

I have lots of info on my YouTube channel too.

By the way, what do you guys think about the...

Oh God, my wife is in the...

My wife is mad that I keep missing stuff and she's right to be so.

So she's now in my agency's Discord, in my Discord with my AM and stuff

and like I have to be like, I can't make the same jokes anymore.

But what do you guys think of the thing?

I'm just real curious.

I know a lot of you guys don't watch my YouTube,

but after a year, I learned to do the opposite of stocky in this stream to win big.

So you're not...

You don't make jokes.

You don't bullshit with people.

You don't invest.

Like I don't know what the opposite of what I do in this stream.

You need to look at the NBA gambling news and do a whiteboard on it.

It's kind of insane.

We watched the whole thing today.

I'd like to wait for more stuff.

So I have somebody and it's not taking Will's job.

But I have somebody that it's a lot of money,

but I want to make sure I do it right that has started doing videos again.

And so started started taking each stream and breaking it up into four different segments

and putting them out every day.

So four videos a day.

Have you guys as any of you guys like watched it?

If you have like, what do you think about it?

I mean, I think I need to work on the thumbnails.

I think the thumbnails are probably shit,

but it's like we're taking all of.

The can you be a truck in a fight?

Of course, I can be a truck in a fight.

Jesus fucking Christ.

That's not being mean.

I just I can just look at somebody and tell him I can beat the shit out of them.

It but that's because some people have better skills.

I mean, I'm fucking you know trained for that better thumbnail.

So what do you guys think lighter thumbnails or like because these do look pretty bad.

They're pretty dark need a bigger face,

but like you guys like a lot of people have said hey stocky I missed the stream

or I missed a part of the stream or had to go away

and I don't want to go back and watch the whole Vaude.

So it's basically just editing it down.

Down into specific, you know things I haven't even watched a single one of them.

So I'm asking you know what you guys think audio is quieter.

Can you whiteboard the subprime auto loans defaulting at higher rates?

It feels like the subprime mortgage housing crisis.

What do you mean? It feels like it a house is a thousand.

Those are my three biggest graphic right now.

I feel like I need to jump right into the crazy shit finding your credit.

It's American economy retirement were to say the median total valuation

and that's at 20 God.

He aged since that stream that was Monday.

That's a retirement crisis retirement crisis today.

I know how to fix this problem and bring surplus.

I'd be like Bill Clinton without getting his dick sucked just today.

I know how to fix that would have been that that should have been the first thing of that video right there.

That should have been the first thing you saw when you opened up that video right here.

This problem and bring us a surplus.

I'd be like Bill Clinton without getting his dick sucked.

It's very simple that just you go to Detroit got to rebuild Detroit.

Okay, the Lions.

The Lions aren't really using their stadium.

I mean my I mean opposing teams use their stadium more than they do you go to Detroit.

You get that big fucking football stadium, right?

And here's what you do.

You take three elderly people three people age 65 and older fire will this isn't will this is a new guy.

He's tested it out and we're just testing things out.

This is the first full month.

We're testing it out.

You want dedicated content for YouTube bitch.

I ain't got time for that gift graphics spliced in memes 12 minutes is too long blur chat for the first minute.

RIP will will is in charge of all.

My shorts.

This is a guy.

He lives in other country.

He wanted to give it a shot of putting out four videos every day and and doing it and and we're testing it out.

We're it's it's you know, it's something that we're just testing get them by weight height walking ability.

If they're in like a walker you can put like spikes on the end of it.

Like if they're in a wheelchair, they're in a scooter or whatever and they enter into the sgbx, huh?

Is it still going?

Let's not talk about it.

People going to ask questions if we make too much money on something that was wild in it three social security checks.

Go in and three exit three checks do and you put them in there and you have them fight to the death gladiator style.

Okay, whether it's with my reaction to myself.

No, somebody asked me to watch it for a second to see what it was like, you know, walkers with with spikes at the end of it.

You give them some fucking I don't know what those little like do they still have those little Clipper things.

We used to grab and pull things off the top shelf.

But like they have like electrical nodes to him or something like that and you have them fight to the death number one.

You have ticket sales.

All right box seats are reserved for people that are going to inherit the money of the losers ticket.

Sales.

I mean that's that's pretty big broadcasting rights three food and beverage.

I was just explaining how to big one.

You can even how to how to solve the retirement crisis.

That's all but basically, you know fucking fight to the death.

You're going to sell like not a big vodka drink that you know, they're like and here's the incentive only one walks out.

But the one that walks out gets to keep another social security check.

So now they get to social security checks.

The third one goes back to the treasury.

So the local economy.

Makes money off of the sport off of the spectacle.

The individual now has twice as much money and the third check goes back to the treasury.

So now we are in we are we are we are helping the local GDP.

We are solving the national debt and we are making people better off in their life.

My grandmother watches this.

Do you understand what I'm doing here?

Y'all ain't ready to have this conversation.

Y'all too soft right now.

Y'all I don't appreciate you editing the blurb out.

Okay, bro want the problem fixed but y'all don't want to talk about what needs to be done.

And I'm okay with that.

But why Detroit that's a whole other whiteboard, but I love my grandma.

If you really love grandma, you better take her ass to the gym.

All right, give her a little extra insure.

Okay fucking put some protein creatine in that shit.

Take grandma to the fucking gym.

All right, you want grandma to fucking do the fucking grandma's got bragging rights.

I perform enhancing drugs allowed you goddamn right there.

You think we're drug testing them?

Jesus an 80 year old guy would take him six days to piss enough for a drug test.

All right, grab a heart attack if I gave her creatine fuck it.

She's DQ then bro.

What are you talking about?

Y'all don't want to talk about fixing the problems.

I just want to bitch about them.

I didn't know I said any of that.

I am I because when I do this stuff, it's all just just live

and it's just it's just like I just say what's coming out of my mouth

and then forget all about it.

I have no oh man.

Why is your shit always so unhinged because I'm not right in the head

and it's part of the reason why you watch me.

You got to lead with that shit stocky.

Yeah, I know.

How is will not made that into a clip?

I don't know man.

I get anxiety about not knowing what I should do.

But also it's the idea that like I don't know what's going to work.

What's not going to work and like, you know, you know, I just I don't know, you know,

like I don't know what people want to watch and like do I just stick to twitch

and just you know, I mean like you just don't know if you really love grandma.

You better be taking her ass to the gym.

My wife doesn't want me to do the things because it's a lot of money to hire an editor

that does four full videos a day.

So we're just testing it out to see how it works.

That's why I really want it to work.

Because I want to, you know, I'm not going to get any ROI on it,

but I want to I want to like build it up, you know,

but everybody has a different style.

That's why you hire overseas.

I did it still expensive though.

It's like 2500 a month.

My wife says I can get somebody from India to do it for 700 a month.

I was like, I don't I don't care about the money.

I want to see the returns if somebody does a good job with the returns.

You do a segment where you call blackout moments

and have like two to three of them in the compilation each week debate her on stream about it.

I'm not debating my wife dude.

I'm going to lose.

Even if I win I lose.

Yeah, but Aristotle does all his edits.

Y'all just just trying to get shit started.

Oh, by the way, thank you guys.

I know it's weird to say that but I'm now over a hundred thousand people on all three platforms

and I know that I don't keep score and count about numbers like that

because it's like not really my thing.

But from like a like a like a standpoint of you're not done yet.

It's cool.

Now I'm upset about Instagram because I fucked up and didn't do it for the past two three years.

And it's already at a hundred thousand followers in just like six seven months.

So I kind of dropped the ball there but it's better.

It's like with I tell people all the time and they say is it too late to start investing?

It's like no better time was before but it's still good to do it now.

It's the same mindset, but I don't care about the numbers for clout,

which I don't have any I don't tell anybody about that,

but it's kind of a reminder that I'm not done yet.

You know, like some content creators like they're there.

They're there they're getting to the end of their career

and I'm just like no, I'm just in the second wave.

Like my first wave was was was just quitting my job

and then building it up and then covid then GameStop

and then now it's transitioning from the stock and option only trading all day to let's do all this shit.

Stocks finance, you know news that's related to money

and you know the fucking funny jokes

and the back and forth the blurbs the roastings the blackouts the the the the segments the

investing the you know, the education shit sometimes wholesome moments.

I'm enjoying it more. I know you guys are too.

And so it's just like hey, it's not it's not like over it's not ending.

It's just that part is it's now time for the second thing.

And so for me, it's more of a motivation that hey,

listen, I still got it in me and I still doing something.

So now that I that that's happening. It's like, okay, I'm on there

and I know you guys were a big part of that because you're here every single day,

which allows me to do this and put stuff on those platforms

and then the platforms are going to you guys followed

and watch and liked and shit like that.

So I really appreciate it.

And

now I'm banning every one of you.

Okay, I'm not retiring.

Don't forget to order your 1,000 subscriber YouTube plaque.

Well, they wanted to send it to me, but we're moving.

So I didn't want to order it yet.

So I was going to wait till we got up to Delaware,

but now I'm almost under a hundred thousand again.

Do they take it away or did once you have it that you get it?

How was meeting xqc?

We mean how was meeting xqc?

Felix an asshole first fucking thing when we when we were at twitchcon.

I get in there with my wife.

He walks in with his fucking backpack and he goes, hey man.

I said you want to is my wife.

Oh, he goes.

Oh, hi.

She goes.

Hi.

And my wife's like who's this is that's my girlfriend.

Cool.

And then I was like then we actually started talking about money.

Like we got the jokes out of the way and then finally I was like,

you know, we discussed his stuff that in his own way,

you know, I don't it's not in my nobody else's business.

But you know, he tells me something, you know how he's doing and whatever and I did,

you know, whatever like make sure people are good.

Then physically, you know, basically got off with the you know,

like it's it's like I want I don't want to say what I said because I don't want to start any bullshit.

He tried to back off of it like three times.

You'll like nah, man.

I'm sticking to this forever.

This is it.

Thanks for your advice.

Oh, it's a just received for two.

Yo seer.

Thanks for the advice of twitch.com successfully sold my house for 50% off and put everything

Into number two pencil stocks excited to see what happens.

Pro number three, you dipshit not number two.

Fuck that's okay.

I own a lot of NVX stock, which is a graphite.

Not even kidding.

That's one of my it's my biggest like precious like like not,

you know resource thing and their graphite and so you might have actually pumped my stock.

So you fucked up but I might make money.

How's my NVX doing today?

That's for something else.

Y'all were playing a dangerous game that last night to stock you.

What's the worst thing you've ever done?

Nope.

Nope.

Nope.

Uh-uh.

Uh-uh.

Uh-uh.

Uh-huh.

What's stock?

He's worst thing.

I ain't about to get on that.

It's down 10% today.

Yeah, we actually got some.

All right.

How does seer smell like mahogany and aftercare?

What's the worst thing you've ever done?

I'm giving you your points back.

All right.

Let's see.

All right.

So we are let's see.

We talked about that.

I got to clear out my house.

I have to clear out my house.

I have to clear out my house.

I am so screwed man.

I've got a week to empty this entire house.

I'm just going to I'm just gonna start dumping it like not double but like giving it to the

fucking Salvation Army.

I'm just going to go through it every cabinet all our plates and cups all of our like appliances

all of our pots and pans our skillets are fucking at my printer my I'm just going to put it

and I'm just going to send it one car at a time.

I'm just going to because I've been waiting to look for somebody who knows a family that

or knows people that that are in need for household supplies, you know, whatever and

like without being like kind of like, you know directly giving it to them like kind

of give it to somebody to give to them like, you know, just so they know just they have

it.

They don't have to know it's for me.

But I just want to give it to somebody in need rather than give it to like the Salvation

Army.

So assholes like me don't go by it first.

But it's just it's impossible.

It's like very difficult for for for just do a yard sale eat a dick guys.

It's very very difficult to find people who are like, yeah, we'll take your stuff like

some will say we'll take a kid's clothes or we'll do this but like there's just nowhere

that will just take it because they don't have anywhere to store it.

You know, I mean, you know, you post it on Facebook.

I don't want random people coming to my house.

My wife did one Facebook Marketplace thing and the people showed up.

Well first of them.

There was a scam.

The second one showed up and try pulling some some some some shit on us like you don't you

don't just tell people I have things to sell.

This is my home address.

You can't do that shit.

Seki check the meme section in discord.

What did they do the next day?

They tried saying we scam them and they wanted their money back and we're like we're not

home.

They said you better be here at this time or there's going to be problems and I just

took the phone from my wife and I said I'll be waiting for you and they never showed up

but it still bothered me.

Because these people know where we live.

They know we have kids.

They can extort us.

They bought baby stuff from us.

You know, I mean like they could attempt to threaten us and they know parents that have

kids don't want to deal with that shit.

The other time somebody goes we want our money back and I told my wife.

I said just give the money back.

Just fucking get get it back from them.

Give them the money back.

I don't want fucking problems.

I don't want people know where I live and having a dispute over money.

The dude smelled like fucking weed.

The girl had face tattoos, you know, I'm not saying that that's like you're you're

I'm not trying to judge people.

But if somebody the people that look like that show up to your house and the next thing

you know, they're fucking like trying to you know, get money back for something right away

is like that.

It's like it's like just give them the fucking money.

I don't know if this is a scam.

Maybe they need fucking what I don't know what's going on.

But I don't want that.

I don't want that as my fucking household with my children.

I'm not putting up with that bullshit.

So I don't want motherfucking people showing up in my house knowing where I live.

I'm not doing that.

I told my wife I've only ever done these exchanges in the parking lot of a place.

Police station.

I'm not even kidding you.

It may sound like a bitch move.

But let me tell you a little this is this is stocky's little life advice for you.

Okay, if you were going to do a Facebook Marketplace a Craigslist, you're going to do a transaction

that you do online.

Do it in the fucking parking lot of a police station.

I'm telling you right now because people who are criminals or have warrants or on whatever

are not going to show up there.

People who are going to rob you are not going to show up there.

People who are doing a legit transaction are going to do it.

Cops aren't going to fuck with you with public property.

Yeah, that's right.

The police station is public property.

They can ask you what you're doing.

It's another fucking business.

Okay, you're in public.

Okay, unless you're doing something legit that fucking day, but most of them if they say hey,

what's going on?

I'm just waiting here to do a transaction, you know that of you know, I purchased something

or selling something on Facebook Marketplace.

Just want to be safe.

They'll be okay.

Cool.

If you need anything, let us know they don't they don't want to happen in the fucking police

station parking lot.

If it does, they're going to get a lot of shit from the fucking the voters in the City

Council.

Why is it that somebody got robbed in your fucking parking lot?

This is just a thing.

Okay.

All right, and police stations in a lot of towns actually have designated fucking areas

in their parking lots for you to do online seller transactions, not drugs.

I mean, maybe somebody has maybe maybe you're selling them a fucking a lamp, but inside

is full of cocaine.

That's actually that's actually genius.

Holy shit.

That's genius fucking do the transaction there, but do in the parking lot police station,

but but yeah, no seriously this is this is coming, you know, I'm here to teach you guys

about.

Everything to do with money and Finance that I know if you are doing and I told my wife

this actually never made a mistake again.

If you are going to do a transaction, okay, do not have the person meet you at the house.

Don't go to a person's house.

You don't know people are fucking crazy.

Somebody might show up to rob you right?

You've got cash to come buy something for them.

You show up at their house.

It may be the wrong house.

You show up.

They know you got cash.

Guess what?

They could be your house.

They know where you live.

They know so don't do that.

It's not worth the risk.

Do it in a police police parking lot police station parking lot.

Okay, if you don't have a police station close by fireplace a fire fire station or

whatever if you don't have it there, you know, well-lit player do it there.

They even have designated areas.

Now.

I saw one at the hall and not the Hollywood the the Miramar I think if somebody's not

willing to meet you there, then it's not worth the chance.

That's a Florida thing here in California is no problem.

You think that it's a Florida thing that people get robbed people in California don't get

robbed this couple picked up something up at my friend's house and later return a break

in all their cars.

The thieves got caught using a credit card for McDonald's gas facing when you're in prison

out.

Yeah, it's very easy.

Here's the thing.

If I want if I want to rob people the best thing I can do is buy something to them on

Facebook Marketplace.

I now have I'm not suspicious showing up at your house.

I now know exactly where you live.

I can do two three four loops around and if anybody sees get suspicious and ask me.

Oh, I'm just looking for a house.

I hear I'm buying a marketplace thing easy cover story.

You can case the area.

You can look for all the place with the lights.

Are where there's if there's dogs next door like that you do it they have windows open.

You can see now you park in their driveway totally normal.

Your car has been seen there before right you walk up to their house as you walk up

to the front door.

You can tell if they have motion sensors, right?

That's something you don't want to deal with.

You know surprise motion sensor when you're trying to rob a house.

Nope.

You don't worry about that.

I can now walk up and if one goes off, I already know where it's at then I knock on the door

the door opens.

I now see inside your fucking house.

I can see exactly where the fucking hallway is where the kitchen the living room the stairs.

I can see all your house.

I'll stand out here and wait you bring out the stuff.

I give you 10 bucks.

I leave I've got everything I fucking know.

I know where every window is and where every fucking security measure is I can see if you

have a alarm system.

I can see if you have a ring doorbell before I get in front of it.

I can see fucking everything.

Okay, think about it.

Think about it.

Okay, I'm telling you guys.

This is why you have to avoid this.

Okay.

Okay, think about that.

I go and play some marketplace boom $10 for a pair of shoes.

Cool.

10 bucks.

All right, I now take my shitty car whatever like that my truck whatever I get to drive

around loop after loop after loop.

I can see if there's dogs the next door right, which is a big deal.

Okay, it's a unicorn.

I can see if there's how much space there is between if there's cover if there's trash

cans if there's bushes I can see how quickly it is to get out quickest route if I want

to get away where I can park my car.

I already know that if anybody stops me and says you're looking suspicious.

I'm sorry.

This is what the house I'm going to boom now I pull up and I park here now once I do I

can tell if there's a dog in the house.

The number one deterrent for a person for a thief funny enough is a fucking ADT or fucking

alarm sign here.

Go steal your neighbor's fucking ADT sign.

Okay, because that's number one deterrent number two is a dog in the house.

But here's the thing if I go to a window and the dog is barking and doesn't run to a room.

I know that nobody's home because if there's if somebody's home the dog will run to the

door with you at the room with the Alpha and Alpha is a myth but the leader of the house

and protector of the house.

They'll run to that room.

I walk I can hear if there's dogs barking most importantly.

I walk up to your front door as I'm walking the front door.

I can see is there anything into that window?

I can see if there's there's there's an AC unit with a second window here.

I can tell if the door has if there's any you know, whatever most importantly if I do

the transaction at nighttime if there is a motion sensor, it's going to pop off.

I already know where that is.

Oh, you don't have one cool.

I now get to the front of your door.

I know if you have a ring camera or not, you don't want to find out about that until it's

already there.

I can see what side it's on how I come up here.

Boom done open the door again dogs, whatever now I get to see down here.

I know that the kitchen's here.

I know there's the hallway here.

There's stairs up here.

I can see that your living room has a really nice TV and you have a like whatever I can

see that your dining room table is glass with really nice chairs meaning you have nice things.

You probably have heirlooms with like I can see if you have a cabinet with all I can see

all that the average breaking and entering entering last about 60 to 90 seconds by the

way guys the average B&E last 60 to 90 seconds.

It's in smash grab go.

Okay, all the information in data that I need to rob you.

I just got for $10 everything I need I got for $10 and if I don't have the $10 I say,

oh, let me look at it real quick.

Oh, you know what?

I thought they were in better shape than that.

I'm so sorry to waste your time.

The pictures made it seem like they were a little bit better than that.

So, you know, I'm just gonna have to decline but thank you so much for showing to me.

I don't even have to waste the fucking time.

I got everything I know because you were willing to let a fucking stranger come to

your house to give you 10 bucks.

Why take that risk?

Okay, why take that risk?

If you can't afford to drive somewhere to the police station or whatever then go to

the nearest fucking, you know, fucking well-lit Wawa a busy gas station, right?

Whatever.

Just don't do that.

Don't do that and don't go to someone's house.

Okay, do you know how many guys used to get robbed going on a Tinder date because the

girls all like be whatever gives an address shows up and gets fucking jumped and robbed.

It happens.

Maybe not in California, but it happens.

Same thing about Facebook Marketplace going to someone's house that you don't know about.

You don't know.

They know you got cash.

Now, obviously, you can search the address, but be careful.

Go to a page.

If you ever, ever, ever do a online sales transaction that takes place in person, you're going to

get robbed.

Okay, police station parking lot.

I'm dead serious.

This is very normal now.

If somebody doesn't want to meet you in the parking lot of a police station, probably

not somebody you want to do a transaction with.

Police aren't going to bother you.

If they do ask what you're doing there, you tell them, hey, I just, I'm doing a, you know,

I'm buying something from somebody.

I just wanted to be safe.

They'll be like, cool.

If you need anything, they'll keep an eye on you.

And police stations now actually have designated areas for this.

Okay.

I'm going to save some motherfucker's life.

What if I only want to buy Coke, then there's no better place to do it than the fucking

police station parking lot.

Tell somebody to bring it in a fucking lamp, wrap that shit up.

Okay.

Nobody's going to come bother you because you're in the fucking thing.

They're going to be watching you and they're going to see them hand you a lamp and you're

going to hand them money.

Okay.

Say it's a vintage.

I don't fucking know.

All right.

So again, you know, don't, don't do that.

Please.

Honestly, the best way to do a transaction for cocaine.

Okay.

With a police officer.

I'm just going to shut up, but no, seriously, I didn't, I didn't want to illustrate it,

but like understand with B and E's guys, most B and E and you know, what's funny, the two

stats that you learn when I was, when I was, when I was a cop, especially when I was like

going through the FDLE, the two stats, it's probably not changed since then, but the two

stats that blew my mind about breaking and entering the most number one, most of them

last between 60 and 90 seconds.

And number two, most of them happen between one and 3 PM.

That's the crazy thing.

Most breaking in a residential break in entries happen.

They take 60 to 90 seconds and they happen between one and 3 PM.

That's right now because this is when everyone's at work in school.

Okay.

Out the door, 8 to 9 AM.

Okay.

Everyone's out the door for school and work.

Okay.

Um, 10 AM to 11 AM.

This is when affairs happen.

12 is lunch.

People come home for lunch.

Okay.

3, school's out.

So that 1 to 3 PM is the perfect window and they last between 60 and 90 seconds.

Generally people don't go through the front door.

They look for a side window.

They, they love when they have a side window, especially for the second floor, um, get in

smash and grab as much, as much canvassing as they can do is important.

That's why a dog is important and a, uh, the, the thing, you know, floodlights, home security

system sign and dog.

Okay.

Those are your three biggest deterrents for a break in entering, because if I see two,

two houses and one has an ADT sign out, guess which one I'm going to go for initially, there's

a dog barking, biting, alerting.

People don't want to deal with it.

Floodlights very important for nighttime.

I should say motion sensor lights.

These are the three biggest deterrents, the initial deterrents for breaking and entering.

Okay.

Nowadays you got ring cameras and shit like that.

Fun fact.

Okay.

A cheap way to, to, to do a deterrent is to go to a pawn shop or go online and buy a fucking

disabled CCTV camera and just fucking Mount that shit up on the side of your house.

A big ass one.

Like everyone can see it doesn't plug into anything.

It doesn't have a wire.

It's literally just the fucking right, right.

It's just the fucking camera.

No wires, nothing.

You just fucking Mount that to the side of your house.

Biggest fucking deterrent.

It's insane.

I'm, I'm lucky enough to have a police officer next door to me.

I mean, I mean it stops with the breaking and entering, but the domestic abuse keeps you

up at night.

Oh my God.

I'm so sorry.

I was, I wasn't trying to make a political joke.

It was.

Oh my God.

I'm so sorry.

I was.

Oh my fucking God.

Listen, I don't.

And that's the show.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have to eat my lunch, go to the gym, pick up my daughter and get

to work tonight.

So, um, I'm already in trouble.

So MOH I'm holding overnight are, um, I'm not sure what I'm doing with R. I'm not sure

yet.

I'll see how it goes in a day.

MOH I'm definitely holding overnight.

There's some asshole out there who probably over leveraged on short dated N and E calls

and was going to lose everything.

And then today is getting bailed out and we'll never learn anything.

There's no wife beaters in Canada.

You dumb ass.

Oh me.

There you go.

What's a good play that'll make you rich overnight.

Intel puts.

I'm kidding.

Don't do that idea.

I haven't looked at earnings yet.

All right, let's go.

Do you own any LIDAR stocks?

I actually had ouster until this year.

I was down on it.

It was 50% and I sold it for like 250% gain.

Okay.

All right, let's go.

Who are we writing today?

Great fucking play on QS today.

It was very, um, on, on, uh, what sort of looking for, um, unconventional play, but it worked

out really well.

VC was beautiful.

Didn't work out the first play, but then we jumped in right here and got fucking skyrocketed.

Uh, what was the other one I took this morning?

I haven't really seen.

I'm waiting on, uh, R is not working out so far.

We'll see.

Uh, what was the other one, um, that I bought this morning?

I forgot.

SHMD went nuts too.

Uh, OFL hasn't moved yet.

You buying the dip on R and Oscar?

R I'm playing calls on Oscar.

I bought in my longterm portfolio or my swing trade portfolio should say rate of CS guy.

I actually really liked talking to that guy today.

I know you guys think it's all, all for the content sometimes, but I actually enjoyed

it.

What about CLF?

I'm still in CLF.

It's early, man.

You're getting, you're seeing the IV crush happened today, but it hasn't the, the, the,

the, the actual contracts are still sitting where they're at.

Okay.

I don't know where they're at.

I'm down on it though.

I'm down like 17%, but I'm not, I'm not panicking yet.

My options expire.

I have a month out.

I have, uh, uh, uh, the 11, 20 ones.

Raid Flarey.

Is he still on the Bob was all a bedding sting.

Will you be taking the dead body with you to Delaware?

Nah, I feel like there's plenty of dead bodies I can acquire there.

Um, all right, let's go.

All right.

This is the part where we get naked.

Take your clothes off.

Okay guys.

Where's today's notes.

What do you mean?

Today's notes.

I mean, morning call notes.

What did we learn?

I don't have to, we went over time because I decided to teach you guys how to rob a rob

a house after, see, I taught you guys how not to get robbed.

And then I taught you how to do a, a correct B and E. I was trying to teach you how to

avoid being a victim of a B and E, but I accidentally also taught you how to do a correct B and

E. So I guess it's really depends, you know, it's really depends on what you took from

that.

I feel like it's like looking at the same set of data from earnings and some people

say, oh, that's bullish or that's bearish.

Right?

Looking at the same set of data, two different conclusions.

Same thing with the whole B and E thing, but you took anything out of it, please be

safe and don't, uh, don't, don't let people know where you live.

It's a crazy world out there.

And especially with job market getting how it is and people more desperate crime goes

up.

Of course, there's a conversation of, well, that's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, you

know, it's a symptom of what's happening in society.

Oh, that's right.

I did Alex Jones thing too.

Oh, we talked about the Lou today.

What else did I talk about?

Full circle, both sides stream, eat a dick, but not the tulips.

I'll do tulips tomorrow.

When you say B and E, it reminds me of the Dane Cook routine.

Isn't it?

I thought I had Dane Cook on this show 20 years after he helped me get laid.

It was a bad lay, but it was still a lay.

And I told him about it.

I was like, I just straight up told him.

I'm like, you got me laid.

You were my wingman.

So crazy.

20 years later, interviewing the guy that I used to watch.

Somebody said during that stream stocky, I don't know if this means you came up or Dane

Cook fell off.

I was like, all right, let's go.

Now you're the guy getting people laid Java.

When's the last time you got laid?

Obviously not.

I'm not doing a very good job.

All right, let's go.

All right, guys, remember become an Oregon donor.

It's the greatest gift you can give.

It doesn't matter.

It doesn't cost you anything.

That's number one.

Number two, if there's somebody you love, somebody you miss, you haven't talked to in

a while, give them a call.

Give them a text.

Send them an email.

Send them a carrier pigeon.

Let them know you're thinking about them.

Okay?

It can really make somebody's day, but more importantly, go make your own day.

You got the rest of it.

Make the best of it.

And remember, as long as you got two healthy kidneys, you are not broke.

Otherwise, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

Tomorrow's Friday.

Morning calls open to everybody tomorrow morning.

Be there in the Discord 45 minutes early.

I'll see you guys in the morning.

Thank you for everything.

Appreciate you for being fucking simps.

My lurkers, you're the backbone.

I know you're there.

And to everybody, hey, thanks for letting me do this as a job.

I don't know why you come here, but it means the world to me.

And we're going to keep doing it.

Remember, as long as you keep coming, I'm going to keep coming too, baby.

I'll see you guys tomorrow.

Go fuck yourselves.

Tell your mom I said hi.

She got a fat ass.

And as always, as always, stay green, you DJs.

Nice tits.

What was I going to say?

That doesn't fucking matter.
