It's not about looks.

It's about how I feel, man.

I feel so much better when I'm going to the gym.

How is it back?

What do you mean?

Like, how is P90X back?

Well, they said that they're planning to expand their retail rollout

and launching a new P90X program.

That's right.

P90X program.

I thought Bodhi was a lingerie wrestling league.

Yes, that's the one that we played a few years ago.

That was a lingerie wrestling league that was publicly traded.

But I'm playing this because they're bringing P90X back.

There goes Oklo.

We talked about Oklo 1 to watch this morning with the DOE deal.

SoFi launching SoFi crypto.

And Poet doing something with Quantum.

So I'm keeping an eye on them.

Spy getting a little bit of an uptick here.

PLRZ or GPUS.

I mean, both are really fucking degenerate.

Well, our Walmart calls are flying.

It's over.

Everything is going down.

Abandon ship.

Okay.

I remember on Friday, a guy came in and said,

glad I got out of this casino while I still could.

That was at the exact bottom.

That was wild.

Women are hot, bro.

If I make a bunch of stock money, will I get more women?

You could rent more if that's what you're asking.

So the answer is yes.

Listen, there is no such thing as an ugly man, only a broke man.

Okay.

Now you may not get the women you want, but you'll get women.

Who cares about women?

Cock is where it's at, bro.

Honestly, there's times where I wish.

I like cock.

I mean that like to the gay guy in chat.

Like, like I, I, I honestly, you know, think it would be easier.

I think it would be easier.

What a time to tune in.

No, I mean, listen, if you're, whether you're a man, a woman, gay or straight, we're all,

we're all, we're all, we're all here.

We're all here together.

What I'm supposed to like, just because I think the idea of putting that fucking flesh

sausage in my mouth is the most disgusting thing I've ever thought of.

Doesn't mean.

That other people aren't cool with it.

Ladies, you know what I'm talking about?

You guys are the real heroes, but we're, we're all a community.

We're all DJs.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I cannot get that dude's titties out of my, out of my, out of my brain right now.

Not even 10 minutes in.

Okay.

Give me a second.

All right.

Um, yeah, but okay.

So SoftBank is selling their stake at Nvidia.

Some people are saying that this is the sign that this is the top.

Others are looking at it is SoftBank has made an ungodly amount of money off of their Nvidia

position, and now they can sell that for a massive profit and then use that money to

invest in another AI startup or another company to gain more rather than it being up here,

whether or not it gives a red flag because they dumped the entire position.

They didn't scale out.

It's up to each individual investor to, to determine.

And so, I mean, obviously the market's going to react to it.

And because Nvidia makes up so much of the S and P 500 right now, they're

moving is going to determine the movement of tech, which is going to in turn determine

the move of the S and P 500 SoftBank needs to dump their arm position.

I mean, maybe they see something that others don't.

Do you think there's an AI bubble?

Yeah, but bubbles can keep going.

You know what I mean?

Like we've been in a bubble for, for 15 years or 10 years or at least five years, but it keeps going.

And so the higher it goes up, you know, when it does cool off, you know, unless it drops, you know, 50%, if you're

up a hundred percent, you're still profitable.

But the important thing though, is to think that if you're anywhere near, if you're anywhere under 45 years old or 50 years old,

you shouldn't be too worried about it because, you know, even if the market were to fall, let's say 30% and stay that way for three or four years,

that means you get to buy the dip for four years.

That's insane.

So you can't think of it like a concern of, oh my God, I better.

Oh no, please don't do this.

Not right now.

But there's also a stock market bubble.

Please don't do this right now.

So a, a, there's a lot of bubbles, but bubbles can keep growing.

And sometimes bubbles pop.

Sometimes they let a little air out.

Sometimes the bubble moves into another one.

All right, ladies, you know what I'm talking about?

You ever had a fart that traveled up into the vagina and you got a queef out of it?

Okay.

You know what I'm talking about?

Bubbles can, oh my God.

Time on market is a lie.

I saved a lot selling one rotten stock and investing elsewhere.

Then you wouldn't, that's not time in the market.

You're talking about time in a stock.

So the time in the market means buying the total market S&P ETF.

That's not what time in the market means.

So brave and so true.

I know, right?

Either way, Rivian continues to go up, ladies and gentlemen.

We are now at 1675.

NVO having a nice morning.

All Divvy's having a good morning.

We took Oscar calls yesterday.

They are, it took a, took a while to flush out yesterday, but

they are doing pretty good this morning.

So we're gonna continue to, to, to, to hold on to these business.

Are you still on your RH calls?

Yes, they're for next year when, to see if the, the S&P 500 impact,

the S&P 500 impact.

Okay.

Um, does, um, does, uh, uh, oh, we got stopped out of Bodie.

My dumb ass gonna go back in again.

Happy Veterans Day.

I'm gonna do a whiteboard on everything, everything, everything that gives, uh,

give veterans discounts today.

And, uh, I, just because I don't do it doesn't mean other people can't or

shouldn't, so I'm gonna put them all out there for you.

All right, so we're still getting a sell off on everything, uh,

that's not, uh, Mag 7 right now.

Um, damn, Kodak is still going.

All right, what do we got moving right now?

Uh, all right, I'm gonna start selling some more of my, uh, my, my Walmart ones.

Going to Applebee's for free lunch.

Yeah, like I said, there's people, you know, there's nothing wrong with, with, with,

with going out and getting, uh, a free meal from a restaurant if they're offering it to you.

It's not like you're demanding it, they're literally offering it to you.

So, I'm not like, I don't shame anybody for doing it.

I just, I just don't do it because it's just not my, um, it's not my, uh, my thing.

I, I just don't like doing it.

And there's things that people do and there's, that, that they, that, that's totally fine.

And, you know, I'm not gonna tell somebody that they're wrong for doing it.

If, if it's being offered to you, take advantage of it, you know what I mean?

Go for it.

You're too good for free food?

No, I just get weird about personally just, you know, it's, it's my own personal thing.

I, it's, it's just my own thing.

I, I, I just, it feels awkward for me to, um, to, uh, uh, uh, get something because

of my service.

It's just me.

It's just, everybody has their own quirks, man.

Do you have cross eyes?

I can't quite determine.

Do you have cross eyes?

I have a lazy eye.

I used to get in a lot of fights when I was younger.

And because I took so many right hands to fighting that, like, I have a lazy eye.

My nose is kind of crooked.

Are you back in Target?

No.

How do they even know what you're a vet in the U S you have a card or what?

Yeah.

Um, you don't want to see the picture.

This was a bad picture, but yeah.

So they have this, um, it's like this dude looks like a 13 year old dog.

Yeah.

You can get it on your license too.

Which I need to do.

My son who is a menace.

My son is, I don't know what to do, man.

Like I understand terrible twos, but like this is just wild.

And I think it's because it's because he never had any discipline.

He didn't have discipline like my daughter did because I wasn't the one raising him.

But I mean, just in the past few days, he pulls the fire alarm at the Philadelphia airport.

Okay.

Dude reaches into my, my back pocket.

I thought he was trying to get my wallet.

No.

Gets my license and fucking snaps it in half the day I get to a new state.

Okay.

Yesterday, dude finds one of my markers.

I've been hiding my, my, my whiteboard markers.

Finds one of them somewhere, hides it.

And then when we're not looking for half a second, runs over to the beautiful, uh, custom

upholstered couch that we're renting from this house and just starts marking all over

it.

Get that away from him.

Take the, try to scrub that out.

It's not coming out.

Look over.

He's trying to stick a thing into the electrical outlet because we don't have the little things

yet we ordered for the, for the covers.

So we get that away from him.

And as I'm putting that down, he starts reaching up for the glass thing to pull it down.

And I'm like, and so I lose my shit and I'm like, I say, not at him.

I lose my shit.

I said, this is because you guys don't not discipline him.

I said, that's it.

Timeout right now.

And it works with my daughter.

So I took him upstairs to the room for timeout.

He starts crying and I'm sitting when I give him timeout, I sit there with them.

I just sit quietly until they're done crying.

And then when they're done crying, I say, all right, do you know what you did wrong?

Do you know why we're here?

Two fucking seconds in grandma comes running in and grabs them, but I'm fucking fighting

right now, man.

He's acting out because of the move.

No, he's been like that for a while.

58 months.

Thought you were beating his ass.

No, I don't.

I don't hit my kids.

I'll never hit my kids.

It's a sun thing in India.

Yeah.

I'm learning that.

I'm learning that.

All right.

So we're getting flushed out right now.

Uh, on a, on a few things.

I'm not, we, I'm not, I'm not in, I'm not in, um, Oclo or SoFi yet.

Um, I think Oclo is probably the one that has the best opportunity to bounce today.

SoFi has a good opportunity as well, just because of the SoFi crypto thing.

Poet.

I'm going to add a little bit more and then put my stop loss in, uh, poet has a deal with,

uh, a quantum company and, uh, okay.

I think I'm done playing Bodie today.

I took two small L's on this.

Damn.

I was up too.

Good news is that our Oscar calls from yesterday are doing really well.

Can you do a whiteboard on disciplining kids?

No, I'm not going to put a, a, a, a whiteboard on disciplining kids to each their own man.

I mean, everybody has their own thing.

You know what I mean?

I'm not, I'm not here to tell people how to parent, you know what I mean?

How I parent as long as you're, as long as you're within the law.

Within the laws, man.

I mean, I can't say anything.

I, I'm not going to, I'm not going to whiteboard on parenting because that's like a dumb fucking

thing to do.

What do you think about Palmer Lucky?

Good seller or actually good product?

Huh?

Who the fuck is this?

I know the name.

Oh, he's the Oculus guy.

Oh, you're talking about the Anderle CEO.

Oh my God.

I didn't.

You know what's funny?

I never knew his fucking name.

I knew his face.

I didn't know his name.

I'm so fucking stupid.

As soon as I saw him, I'm like, I know that guy.

That's the problem when you follow a lot of companies, a lot of times you don't know their

name, you know, their face like Alex Karp, the CEO of, uh, of, uh, of Palantir.

If you didn't know his name, but you'd know what he is, who he is and what he does.

All right.

Our Oscar calls are flying right now that we got yesterday.

Had to average down a couple of times at the end of the day, but back to green on this.

We took plug calls through earnings, plug, uh, lost money again, but their revenue was

up higher.

So some people were looking at that as a positive.

So what do you think of him?

I don't know him.

I'm not sure what you're asking when you say, what do I think of him?

Like what do I think of him as like his, his, his, his product?

I mean, I think it, Andrew is looking like it's going to do a military and defense first

type of, um, type of operation.

So like open AI has like a lot of different, you know, um, you know, uh, projects and different

partnerships and they're doing like more of the worldwide stuff.

Andrew feels like it's going to be what the military.

The military defense and government AI in, in, um, uh, you know, not just AI, but just,

just all their fucking deals.

It looks like they're going to be like the Palantir of that sector.

All right.

So that's just my, my opinion.

Cause based on everything that they've been doing it, it's, it's like they're, they're

on that.

I don't, I don't know how to explain it.

So it's kind of like Palantir and Andrew are going to form the, the, um, uh, Skynet, you

know what I mean?

Are you holding Monday for long-term?

No, I think I got stopped out yesterday.

I'm so happy you had Ro Khan on the stream.

He was talking mad shit about Chuck Schumer on the news and I kinda, and I can say, I

sort of know the guy.

I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go that far.

Pizza Hut 420 just resubbed for 36 months.

Stocks stare.

Why is the market red if shutdown is ending?

Shutdown doesn't necessarily.

First off, shutdown hasn't ended.

Still got to go to the house.

The house has to agree on it and Trump has to, has to, has to sign off on it.

Number one.

Number two.

NVIDIA is about 15% of the entire S&P 500 and the S&P follows lockstep with NVIDIA.

SoftBank just offload their entire $5.2 billion share, $5.3 billion position in NVIDIA and

some people are worried that that's a sign that this is the top, even though SoftBank

is not saying that.

So if NVIDIA falls, the market falls.

Look at the S&P 500 and add NVIDIA to it or compare it with NVIDIA, okay?

Look at the movements, okay?

If you see the way NVIDIA moves and then you see the S&P 500 moves, right?

Big drop in NVIDIA.

Drop right there on SPY, right?

Push up, SPY pops, drop, drop.

It's almost, the movements are mirroring each other.

Obviously because NVIDIA is a single stock, it's going to have more volatile up and downs,

but the movement's the same.

And so we're getting to that point where the S&P 500 is basically just the NVIDIA.

Add in a couple more like Microsoft, right?

Okay.

But even Microsoft isn't as lockstep as NVIDIA is with the S&P 500.

These two companies make up something like 24% of the entire S&P 500, okay?

24% two companies, 35% are the MAG7.

So yeah, so when you see this news on NVIDIA, people are digesting it that is this, is this

just a SoftBank actually selling their stake in order because they've made so much money

on this position?

Is this just them selling their stake to fund other AI startup projects like they said they

are or is this a sign of something more?

Hasn't it?

Hasn't it ever been like that?

It was in the late 90s into the 2000 bubble.

So if you look at top five companies versus market 1999, I have a chart, maybe it's in

Stockys Daily News.

Let me go into Discord real quick.

I had this the other day and I thought it was really, really telling and it's not that

like I'm calling, I'm not like flooding and I'm saying that we're in a bubble or this

is the same thing that's going to happen as last time.

But it was a good chart.

It was a good chart.

That kind of gives you an idea of where the, the, the, the, the similarities are.

Of course, back then the companies weren't putting out products like the same they were

now.

Of course, products now are, are, are also, you know, right here.

Okay.

So here you go.

All right, here you go.

So this is comparing 2000 to 2025.

So as you can see right here, you know, you're looking at one, two, three, four, five, six,

seven, eight, nine, 10 companies, right?

And you're looking at the EV, uh, you know, the, the, the, the enterprise value as a percentage

of, of GDP, right?

So you're looking at the top 10 here, 28.4% enterprise value versus GDP.

Now it's at 77%.

And you can see where that distribution is, right?

Look at Nvidia's growth since 2023, okay?

And Oracle's coming in hot too.

And so you're seeing this massive, like, you know, uh, you know, consolidation happening.

Right now.

And while that's scary, because one of two things has to happen, either a, the market

has those seven companies are going to have to come down and, and match the rest of the

market, at least, at least a midpoint, a median, that market, or the rest of the market's going

to have to catch up.

And if, if they, if they catch up while they're slow down at the top, you're going to get

a little bit of stagnation on the S and P 500, but your, your, your value positions will

grow.

It will gain.

Otherwise you're talking about.

Uh, uh, uh, you know, uh, uh, a draw down in the, in the, in the broader market itself

because the, the gap between the, the, the top seven and the rest of the market is, is

the highest it's ever been the top 10 and the, and the rest of the market.

It's never been this much of a gap before.

Are we selling or buying?

You're just doing what you do.

Okay.

Remember in the beginning of the year where we, we got into JNUG because we saw gold moving

up, but we saw that miners hadn't moved yet.

And so it was like, wait a second.

Okay.

Um, either gold price is going to have to come down or the miners price is going to

have to come up.

And so we bet on the miners price going up and we're up like 230% on JNUG now.

There is too much money in finance.

What else will people do with the money instead of speculate?

It's not even people speculating right now.

It's just the amount of people that have exposure to the stock market is 50% higher than what

it was eight years ago.

And most of those people are just dollar cost averaging.

Most average Americans are not sitting at a computer being like, Oh, let me check in on

this company.

I'm invested in today.

Oh, let me buy this.

Let me sell this.

They're just like, fuck it.

Dollar cost average into S and P 500.

I just got contacted by a recruiter.

Eli Lilly.

Do you still have those calls?

And should I get a job?

You should eat my ass because I know what you're doing and I'm not looking at those

calls again because they're like $13,000 a piece and I sold them for a thousand a piece.

By the way, guys, remember Rivian?

Remember those Rivian calls we saw back in, um, back in, um, September, the ones that

were only 152 bucks for next, next June.

Okay.

We're up a hundred and, uh, 38% on them right now, 148% now Rivian is at $17 a share.

We bought the shit out of this under 13 bucks.

I own too much Rivian too.

All right.

SoFi starting to curl up, Oclo starting to curl up, um, poet and body are both very speculative

positions, but I think Oclo and SoFi have the best opportunity to jump today.

If spy goes up, um, SoFi with the launching of SoFi crypto and Oclo with the DOE announcement.

When do we sell?

Sell what?

Rivian?

I mean, I don't know what to tell you, bro.

What do you, what do you want to do?

I mean, if it gets to 20 bucks, I'm going to leg out about a quarter of my position, but

the rest of it, I'm going to hold because I still want to see where it goes from there.

All right.

Good pickup on Oscar yesterday.

Um, our FTNT that we picked up a couple of days ago is up 9%.

Great dip on that.

Cybersecurity is way undervalued.

Uh, guilt backup next is up Walmart green today.

IEP is green.

We've got Ford backup.

Pfizer 1% up Oscar 4% today, uh, NVO 5% today, Rivian 3% O's doing well on the downside right

now though.

We got Palantir down 1%.

Uh, we got N and E down 3% time for me to buy, buy a couple more shares if it goes under

36.

Um, damn, I almost want to run N and E calls.

Ah, it's a tough one there.

Also we're all going to jail for Kodak by the way, guys, I hope you're, I hope you're

prepared for that.

Ooh, EHR looking kind of sexy too.

Fuck it.

I'm gonna pull the trigger.

I know this is stupid.

Oklo news I think is going to, is going to push N and E. Fuck the spreads on these are

terrible.

All right.

Fuck it.

Oh, there goes Poet.

There it is.

Nice.

We got a, we got a second, a second fill at 511 too.

Happy Veterans Day.

Um, thanks.

I'm not used to this type of music on the stream.

What do you want?

Should've waited three minutes.

Um, you touched RLMD since the insider buy last week.

I'm already up 20%.

Really?

Oh my God.

You know what's funny?

I was, I did a breakdown that morning of, uh, of all of the insider buys.

Um, you touched RLMD since the insider buy last week.

I'm already up 20%.

You touched RLMD since the insider buys.

And I thought RLMD was the most interesting and I was gonna put it on the list for that

day for us to, um, to go check in on, but then we got caught up with some bullshit.

I forgot what it was and I never went back to it.

Thanks for SoFi.

Bro.

It's not a fucking signal service.

Fuck you guys, man.

God damn it.

I'm so busy fucking streaming.

I can't, you know, it's probably better though, because I take less risks doing it this way.

Hair looking thin today.

Oh, I didn't gel it up.

It's just kind of like it is what it is, plus the overhead lights off.

Look at NRGV.

Bro is coping.

NRGV.

It's up 30%.

I don't remember what the thing is.

Saki, you should scavenge all the free meals today for Veterans Day and make it a stream.

Nah, I don't feel right doing it.

It's just me.

SoFi.

Thanks, Saki.

Did you guys just all take SoFi after the morning call?

What the hell is wrong with you guys?

Or sorry, after open?

Yes.

Okay, that caught.

No.

All right.

We're actually pretty, pretty damn green today.

Uh, Rivian is fucking carrying hard.

NVO is doing well.

Google's up.

Um, Oscar we picked up yesterday.

It had to average down towards the end of the day, but it's moving pretty nicely.

Uh, IEP's green.

Uh, CCAP's green.

Next is green.

ST...

Oh, sorry.

FTNT is green.

Walmart's green.

AbbVie's green.

Verizon green.

Aerie green.

Cyber green.

Okay, good.

Speaking of open, looking good the past few days.

Uh, we talked about open this morning.

We talked about para, para.

So we did a full breakdown on a lot of this stuff this morning.

Oh, there goes Bodie.

Let's go, Bodie.

Come on, baby.

Come on.

Save my ass.

All right.

Up a half a percent.

All right.

Let me tighten my stop losses now.

Uh, 15 at four.

15 at six.

And...

Let's just do 15 shares at four percent.

15 at six.

15 at nine.

And 15 at...

I only have 60 shares.

You know what?

Fuck that.

I'll do 30 at four and 30 at six.

I'm not gonna tier it that much.

Yucky underscore eyeball just resubbed for 24 months.

I need to pay for medical bills.

Let me get a YOLO stocky.

I, I, I, I need to pay for medical bills too, bro.

But, but I ain't YOLOing for that.

All right.

Poet coming back nicely.

Um...

You bought any NVO?

Uh, I stopped buying NVO a while ago.

Um, when it went to like, I think my average on NVO now is 48, 50.

And so at this point, I'm just letting the, um, I'm just gonna leave it and let the, the

dividend reinvestment buy new shares for me if it falls more instead of adding more because

as much as I like it as a value company, it's balance sheet is one of the sexiest fucking

things I've ever seen.

Uh, there's a lot of going on in that, in that, uh, in that sector right now.

And it could be a while.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

It's great.

It's great.

It's great.

I think people can come and listen to it.

And one of the things that really makes Valensheets wanna do is they'll...

They'll sell things that are going real good.

People come into it.

There are certain...

Okay desirably they feel it, but I can pay more.

Because, um...

Exactly.

That perspective you gave just now is actually pretty well built.

Uh, that's a completely accurate picture.

Because the half deal Steinviger who currently is a big guy, but right now he's at $800,

lower, it'll buy more free shares at a lower valuation, and then I can come and revisit it

later. Are we dropping Nvidia today? I'm not dropping Nvidia. If Nvidia tanks, the market

tanks. Fuck it. What do you do to mitigate capital gains tax? I mean, I have things that I've been

holding onto for years that were like fucking big L's, at least from a percentage side, that I can

always tax loss harvest if I have to, but otherwise, just fucking pay them, man. The market is already

tanking. How long is the VTR hold until it pays for my retirement? I'm going to use my VTR shares

and dividends to pay for my retirement home. I'm basically paying for my retirement home with my

retirement home stocks. All right, nice bounce back right now. I normally do futures, but I want

to learn options too, okay? It's like saying I smoke cigarettes, but I want to smoke crack too,

you know? I know the basics, but I haven't figured out how to control risk like stop losses and

futures. Can you point me in the right direction?

If possible, I, yeah, I mean, if you, if you, it depends on the platform you use. Generally,

they have stop losses. For example, you go sell to close, like on Robinhood, you can go to the

right there and you can put stop limit or you can go and you can put in your stop limit. They don't

have trailing stop losses on options though. What's up with Cisco as a company? I haven't been

following Cisco much. Can you explain fiscal dominance? Yeah, when Nadia gets here, I'll link

you up with her. She does that for a living. I'm not even kidding you. She used to be a financial

advisor, found that there was a lot of money in the stock market, but now she's like, I don't know

so many guys in high stress jobs that, that, that, that, that made money, you know, we're dealing

with shit. There she is right there. And then realized, why am I getting paid peanuts for what

these guys really need? They don't need a financial advisor. They need someone to financially dominate

them. And she is making a lot of money doing that. Okay. She found a niche. I found a niche. Okay.

A little bit different. Can you give us an example? Yeah. When I say, okay, let me find somebody right

now, a top person. Hey you're coming up at an Oscar award, you're being ranked in the gold agency

with your advice and all that stuff, that's a lot of money right now. Why? Because you have so

much money though. Why do you need, why do you need the edge? Why do you need to pay? Why does

you need to pay more? Why do you need the edge? What would they do? Hey, maybe if you stopped

gettingGrader right now, maybe a lot of people would have the edge and they could be getting

more money if they really need it. Undoubtedly it's worth it. So all right. That will be an

example. It'll be a construction prompt. quandkun�s going pay, they have to give you

a cyber vest and a safety vest too. Okay that's all there is to show up in this game? No you

to cover the bill for you stop being such a pussy stop seeing so broke all right fucking give me

your money like a good boy i'll tell everybody that you're a rich boy i'll tell everybody that

you've got money i'll make you feel special i won't tell anybody your secret that you're just

a little pussy stop saving your money you're not a fucking squirrel hiding his nuts okay how about

i hide my nuts in your mouth you bitch like that's the kind of thing they do okay not okay it obviously

it's better i'm not a professional okay stop it all right so so so nadia nadia when are you going

to come on and explain what you do because this is a legit business in the finance world like i'm

not even kidding sake you have a big ass forehead yeah because i got a big brain okay why why did

that cause people to sub to me that wasn't what i was trying to do welcome okay some of y'all

actually see what i mean like it's it's and i'm not an attractive female it hits harder now that

you're doing it in a basement

all right rivian leaps absolutely exploding today i hate to leg out of one of them but i'm going to

the well i'll keep one in case i want to exercise it later but um bro i was pissing next to you and

i couldn't help but notice that your wiener is insane seriously dude your hog is money do you

want to be boys i run with a nasty crew of dudes who all got wild um that wasn't me for sure but

i hope you find who you're looking for what superpower do you want teleportation that's

what i want i want to be able to

put myself anywhere at any time toss the bomb just resubbed for 20 months

isn't guys come on man it's it's it's 38 minutes into the day can we can we just not right now

who have dudes who all got wild saturday my place we're gonna take a bunch of

and see what happens this talking movers is a green screen i'm out of the loop yeah i'm in

delaware now and it's funny too because this morning in delaware it was 30

two degrees or 31 degrees felt like 20 and it had a gale warning and i looked at the um i looked i

looked at you know our house and so i was basically um just comparing which you know how

they say the the thief is the comparison of joy this is kind of the example right okay this i went

this is us this is here this week and this is home are the kids handling the cold all right

i think the kids are you know they're not keeping together think of them as friends if they use their room, love is possessed with the shadow.

not really because they my daughter's been had his cough for like a month and a half and the doctor

keeps saying oh it's nothing big deal you know we got a CPAP for in case it's emergency but I want

her developing pneumonia um Baio's loving it like he went out I had to take him out because he has

to go to the bathroom like a lot of times at night now so he keeps waking us up to go because of his

his chemo and like he went out and he just laid in the grass for like 30 minutes I could not get

him in no I've been in cold weather before I I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina no

the mountains like six seven thousand feet up or five six seven thousand we've got very cold it

was the same weather as we have up in Delaware um I've been there I've been in the mountains uh uh

in uh in the Himalayas I've been in very cold weather before I don't have a problem with cold

weather um I actually enjoy it I like the seasons changing the problem is though is that you know

we're we're we're having we just got here and we're transitioning so we're getting we're still

getting all the clothes and all the stuff and and and and you know you have to it's it's it's

more of a pain in the ass getting dressed up to go out than it is going out you moved right when

it started getting miserable no i like it i like it i just don't like it at 3 a.m when i have to

take my dog out and i'm barefoot and i have to go get a coat on and get shoes on get and then then

now you're the fucking awake as you're and then not only that your dog sits out in the grass and

then starts barking at somebody and it just lays there and enjoys it and you're like dude what the

hell how's delaware by the way it's fucking dark but i like it i mean it's nice we're in a nice

neighborhood like all the houses are like brick colonial houses with nice manicured yards and

big oak trees and and and you know it's nice uh uh you know so far you know i've i've gotten to

know some of the neighbors to talk to them um uh you know uh it's it's we're pretty centrally

located we're not in wilmington but we're north of it and uh it's it's not bad it's not bad you

know um you know the problem is is anytime you move somewhere you miss the place you were

because you get nostalgia i'll think think about it this way every time we think of our childhood

we think oh man i wish we could go back to our childhood oh those years were better times those

were better times we think like us that grew up in the 80s or 90s right man they were better times

it was the better time no you're you were a kid and you only remember the good things right it's

kind of like when you move somewhere you you miss your home because you think of all the positive

things you don't think about the reason you moved or the negative things right and so it's just

something that you kind of have to develop and you just kind of get used to it you know

what i mean and then you develop new things you like about the new place and things you don't

like about the new place and and then you'll still have nice memories but it's always the

nice ones we hold on to when you think of your childhood i mean unless you're me but even then

you still try to you think about the fun things the enjoyment things because our brain wants to

remember those things nah they were better times how to deal with a family member passing what do

you mean how to deal with it you don't deal with it you grieve it's okay as a guy it's all right to

be sad it's okay to miss somebody it's okay to grieve you don't have to pretend that you're not

hurting man if you're hurting it's okay you know as you get older life stops giving you things and

starts taking things away and it's not easy and it's okay to cry it's okay to call somebody it's

okay to spend time with somebody so do that remember them but instead of being being sad

about them being gone think about all the amazing things that you've done that you've done that you

did together and remember that and highlight that and use that as a reason why other people in your

life that you should be spending more time with spend time with them make memories it's never too

late to make new memories i think we forget that it's like with baio right like he's he's he's he's

he's not gonna make it you know for much longer and instead of being sad the whole time i'm like

it's never too late to make new memories and so that's what we're doing you know what i mean

you don't have to get over it don't let people tell you just get over it dude everyone grieves

their own way but remember the good times you had with that person and then use that as a reason to

make new memories now with people you love okay all right moving on got it gramps thanks for

answering i mean there's just no easy way man there's just no easy way is there's no

easy way to to deal with that like i'm one of those people where i've i'm numb to it you know

what i mean but the only this is fucked up to say but the only person you know i mean like

you know but even though i'm numb to it i still have you know i still feel it you know what i

mean like it scares the shit out of me sometimes to think that like you know something like that

could happen and so i'm like but it can like as much as you don't want something to happen

it doesn't mean it won't happen and so so remember that you know i have something that

people think is depressing psychopath you think i'm a psychopath interesting i showed you guys

one time i have a i have something that most people would think is is toxic and and and

depressing but for me it hits different i have a calendar and i have it upstairs i should show

it to you guys i have a calendar that shows the weeks of your life if you live to be 80 years old

and it's a line of bubbles and it's 52 weeks a year or something like that for for 80 years

and every time a week is done i bubble one now most people would say that is toxic that is

depressing no it's not it's motivating for me it's not that i'm counting down how much longer i have

to live and for mine i don't know if a few of those a bunch of those rows is probably gone

it reminds me that i need to take more advantage of the time i have who asked bro what is your

problem somebody asked about

dealing with with with with loss that's all all right fuck it i won't talk about it then

sorry the point of it was that everyone deals with things differently all right that's all

i'm getting at everyone deals with things differently and so some people you know if

they don't have that reminder that time is limited and time is a thief that they they they won't they

won't take advantage of it somebody like me i look at that and i say well you know better start

making good

use of the time because it when it's a realization sometimes you don't realize that 10 years has gone

by and you're like shit all right you know what it doesn't matter um bode came back for me poet

came back for me and i am uh having a good day with rivian who's gifted five subs to viewers

do you regret spending all the time doing stocks and stuff no i enjoy doing it what i regret is

the time that i spent only trading on my streams and not doing what i do now which is having

conversations and doing historical whiteboards and talking about the news and memeing and making

inappropriate jokes and and and and you know and commenting on stuff that i i do regret that but

not regret as in like oh my god i wasted it it's like i learned a lot of lessons from what i did

i don't regret that what i do regret is all the time i spent after market close i used to sit here

at four o'clock and then you know watch earnings and play bounces and do all that and then i'd be

stuck in a position i'd be watching it all night it was a lot of time i spent watching it all night

it was distracting so what i do now is is is since i've moved to delaware i've stopped doing that

unless for some reason the kids are out and i just happen to be doing something else i'll check it

for but you guys notice i'm not i'm not in here trading all night you know after hours there's no

point in that at that point it's just a waste i'm just i'm just fucking around i'm not even doing

anything you know i'm just basically gambling because you're you're hoping that you know these

bounces bounce that i used to do and i've stopped doing that because it's just it was just out of

boredom um so you know no i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i'm not doing

i don't regret trading stocks i i i like trading stocks and i have fun um but you know bro you say

that but i feel like you've always done this no so during and after game stop i just literally

just traded non-stop till 4 p.m like i would answer questions and we would go over stuff but

i was just options trading and stock trading non-stop i was forcing trades i was looking for

trades that weren't in my morning uh uh you know uh list it wasn't on my you know it wasn't it was

just it was just i was doing because i thought that's what i needed to do to keep my viewership

not realizing that the viewers that were watching me were never going to stick around because they

were interested during the game stop thing and then they went on with their lives people that

wanted to be here wanted to be here for the community and for the jokes and for the memes

and the inside stuff and some trading and some investing and the news and keeping up with the

market and stuff like that they didn't really care about me for they don't if anything me forcing

trades hurt hurt my my viewership more than anything because people were doing the same

thing and not having the discipline to to you know uh to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to

you know, to, to, you know, I wasn't showing much discipline and they blew up accounts and stuff.

So yeah. Uh, what do you think about starting new private jail companies? I think you would

be good at it. Uh, I don't want to be, I invest in them. Uh, I don't, that sounds terrible.

What made you get into Rivian leads? What analysis did you see? Also, once again,

welcome to Delaware. Thank you. Um, but, uh, what made me get into Rivian? I did a huge,

uh, deal whiteboard, like five whiteboards about it over a month period. Um, and, and, and it's

hard to, it's hard to get into again, but it has to do with Amazon's investment. Them still being

in, um, them getting the, uh, um, uh, partnership with LG, uh, America to, to do their batteries,

which means that they're no longer considered their, their components overseas. It's American.

So if there's any restrictions on overseas components, they, uh, can bypass that, uh,

GE, uh, uh, getting the, uh, or was it, was it?

Or was it Lenovo? Whatever it was. Um, and then, oh, sorry, LGE. And then LGE getting that plant

from, um, from GE, uh, for a big discount. Then, uh, Rivian, um, uh, getting that, uh,

up in investment from, um, who was it? Uh, was it not Honda, Toyota? Was it Toyota?

Raising it from 5 billion to 5.6 billion. Uh, there was just so many catalysts and I'm like,

you know what? You know, I don't, you know, EVs are going to be here eventually. Um, whether we

have it this administration or next administration, uh, it's going to be, it's going to be, it's going

and, you know, while Tesla owns that market, there is still a large portion of people that

are going to not buy a Tesla, right? Like Ford used to own the market, but there were several

other companies as well. So there's a large gap there that needs to be filled and you never know

what another company could take out. And so I said, okay, well, Rivian, if I'm going to play

that sector sector, if Tesla is the, is, is the leader of that sector, I think Rivian has the

most to, to, to basically, you know, clear up the slop left over and that could make them more

valuable than they currently are.

Yeah. And Ford just scrapped their, uh, F-150 lightning too. Volkswagen investment. Thank you.

I have a video on it on my, uh, on my socials. All right. So if I curl it up again,

how are your restoration hardware calls? I haven't looked. Let me take a look here.

Thanks. If I see you in town, I'll definitely ignore and keep moving.

What town? I avoid towns.

Saki, you've given me hope and your story inspired me in the sense that the small guy can achieve

anything if they put their mind to it. I went from a futureless kid to studying a master's in

corporate finance and stock.

Market looking to get into equity research one good day. I will never forget you. Thank you.

I can't tell if something's a troll nowadays or not. It's interesting enough. It has nothing to

do with me, bro. That has nothing to do with me. All right. You did all that. Never give

someone else credit for something you did, but I'm glad that we have developed and created

something that you were interested in that led you to do something. You like the amount of people

I've run into outside of the stream that like I've met in person or,

I've talked to me that like because of what we do here gave them something they were interested in

that led them to a new career is actually really surprising. Has nothing to do with me. I just

happen to be on and you just happen to be when you click the channel and, and, and we have fun here

has nothing to do with me. You know, that's all you, but I'm really surprised. I didn't think that

people would get interested in it because of this. Um, yeah. Sofi volume came in high.

One of your best bits is about taking chances. Yeah. That doesn't always work though.

Yeah.

The bit does, but like when you're married, sometimes taking the chances and you say,

what's the worst they could say? No, it could get worse. You inspired me to start streaming

and giving wild stock takes good. How's it been going for you? It looks like it's going pretty

well. We got to get, you got to get a better, uh, schedule, my man. Hey, today's your happy

your affiliate anniversary. Congrats. What's your top clip? Who are your biggest players in XLR?

Pretty much. It's JPM.

G S M S. Those are your biggest players. And then that's shortly followed by W intraday price

action. Kick it dude. Go for it. What does upstart do your Twitter account? Tried to sell me a course

for $5,700. Fuck you. What the fuck are you talking about? Did you just get, did you just

get scammed by somebody who copied my name? So you're, wait, you're telling me that somebody

made a Twitter account called the stock guy, not my Twitter account.

You could literally click on my page right now to see if it's mine or not. You did no research on

that and, and got a DM and, and they said, buy my course for $5,700. And you thought that was me.

And now you're mad. You're mad at me because a fake account tried to sell you something.

They put a train on my mom for free. Okay. Why is static just resubbed for 26 months?

Best one just resubbed for nine months. You're getting investigated.

You need to be investigated. Like to see if you're like competent to drive a car.

Holy. Why do you deny these scam allegations? Pretty sus. Because I'm not even good enough

to try to do it. I'm mad that, that, that, that bots and scams are making more money off of me

than I am. I'm salty, man. All right. Rivian leaps at $500 a piece. Now guys, $500 a piece

on these Rivian leaps.

Envy up 5% today too. Look at Rivian go. Holy shit. Can you draw a line at NNE so we can follow?

Sure. 2026. They're June, 2026. Any news on Supreme Court and tariffs? No, we haven't really gotten any

much, uh, much from that right now. Bodie bouncing back nicely though. Still waiting on Poet to get a

run. Corweave keeps getting cheaper. Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I'm not like, Corweave's not like

a scam or anything, but like, you know, Corweave isn't exactly the cream of the crop when it comes

to people that are looking, that might be scared out of, uh, with NVIDIA right now because NVIDIA

and Corweave are very much intertwined. And if Corweave has bad earnings and then NVIDIA,

you know, people are worried NVIDIA might have a problem, then they're going to push even further

down on that. What happens with future trading? Um, I'm actually do, I actually did really well

when I came out of that. Um, I used that first account to kind of understand what all the things,

like all the, the, the buys and sells and all the stop losses were. And then I ended up getting a

down limit on it, but I didn't care because I was just using that, that dummy account,

to, to kind of like figure out how it works. So I started the other account out and then I traded

a couple of contracts. Cause we thought, remember that day I said, I think it's going to, it's going

to end higher that day at the end of the day. And people were saying it was stupid. I put some in

there, got stopped out of one, had two more and then the S and P gap fully up. So I'm actually

up on it, but I haven't touched it since, even though there's a tournament going on right now,

because I'm doing it in partnership with this, this, this company that that's like, like it let

me use their platform. And, uh, I got to meet with them like tomorrow, whatever, before we finish it

and then I'll do it probably the end of this week. Did you hear people saying Dow Jones at 50 K

the camera quality is too crisp. Can you lower it to 40 P I can count your gray hairs.

He blew up two demo accounts. No, I blew up one because I was legitimately buying like five or

six contracts at a time, trying to figure out how to, how to mark stop losses and, and, and,

and, and sells and buys and stuff like that. I still don't fully understand futures trading,

but now that I'm doing, now that I understand it, I'm only going to do the one or two contracts.

Um, I missed it. Where is stocky?

What? What does that mean? Why does it say first time chatter? If you've been following me for two

years, that was some fun stuff. Yeah. Do you remember your first big trade W in regards to

what? Like I remember my first big W like being like, uh, trying to be a high frequency trader

was a penny stock. And that was the worst fucking thing that could happen to me. No, I was, I was

figuring out how the, how the, how the charting works on there. All right. Um, let me get back

to it right now. So we got, uh, Rivian leaps.

We're now at five 10. So we're now up 180% on that. Um, I'm in Delaware. Yes. I'm in Delaware

now. Okay. I'm not taking a lot of trades right now because the market's just kind of all over

the place right now. Uh, our Oscar calls from yesterday though are doing really, really well.

It took a while. I bought it one 80, one 60, one 30, one 20. And now I'm up, uh, let's see where

we at now. I'm up. Uh, I'm green now. It's up 21% today. So I'm up 5% overall, uh, legging out of

was probably, probably a bit early on my buy yesterday, but I still think that, uh, you know,

healthcare stocks are going to bounce back because in my opinion, Trump's little like,

Oh, I'm giving $2,000 tariff dividend to the American people. And then also using federal

funds to pay people directly for their medical, instead of, uh, giving it to health insurance,

healthcare companies. That's just one of those things where if the Supreme court,

and it looks like we're right, because it looks like he's already fighting that the Supreme court

got bad info. And that's why they're going to vote against tariffs. If the Supreme court,

does vote and strikes down all or part of the tariff, he's going to go back and say, Oh, now I

can't give the American people a stimulus check to help them through the holiday season because

the Supreme court is, is destroying, you know, uh, this, this, this, this, this money. And so it's,

it's, it's one of those pleas where it's like, he's setting it up to where it looks like he was

trying to help. And now the Supreme court's going to ruin it. He's already said that that's $3

trillion in money. The government's got to pay out to businesses and bankrupt us and all this

other shit. He's gone off on a fucking tangent. So I think that that whole healthcare thing was

just, um, just part of that ploy right now that he's using that because, because it looks like

the Supreme court, like we said, the Supreme court looks like they are probably gonna strike down

some of the tariff stuff, if not all of it. And if that is the case, um, this is just his like

plea to, or not plea, but his like idea of like building a case as to, as to how he can, you know,

blame the Supreme court for, for any, any bad things that happen. And, uh, so that's why I

jumped back into Oscar yesterday. Um, and I bought a little bit more MOH and I didn't touch my UNH

cause we're in for two 27, but I think that healthcare stocks took a huge hit off of that

announcement, but I think it's going to get, it's going to, it's going to get washed away

or at least we won't hear anything for a while. So that's why I bought the dip on those.

And, uh, we've been in cure for, we've been in cure for a while. Remember that was our play

on a healthcare bounce back with the ACA. And, uh, we've been in cure for a while. Now we got

in at 78, 76. I think we averaged down. Let me double check. This was our triple leveraged,

uh, healthcare ETF. We're now over a hundred.

So we're up, uh, about 51% or 48%, something like that. I haven't checked it today.

Yeah, there we are. We bought it 70. Oh, sorry. 72. We bought it 69 and we bought again at 66.

So we're probably, Oh shit. That means we're, uh, we're over a hundred or over 50% on this now,

probably closer to 60. I haven't looked at it since yesterday, but we bought this because we

figured that there were, uh, it was a significant, uh, oversell is also the same day that we bought

UNH shares. All right.

It looks like it wants to run again, but all right. Other ones that we were looking at today

as well. Um, Oh, by the way, um, I, uh, I got invited to the streamer awards. I didn't get

nominated. At least I don't think, I don't know yet, but I got invited. No, this was before

nominations went out. No, no, no. I didn't know the nominations, the nominee. I got invited like

two weeks ago. I just didn't tell you guys about it. So he didn't make it. Well, I don't know.

They haven't announced the nominations yet. The thing is,

I'm being really nice because I guess, you know, fan fan, and she's kind of a,

not a friend, but we're friendly to each other. She reached out and said, Hey, we want to know

if you would invite it. And at first, the problem is that I was being really nice about it. Cause

I'm like, Oh, that's nice of you to invite me and stuff like this. But I know the reason that I got

invited. So I don't know if I'm allowed to say this or not, but so I'll put it this way. Fuck.

I don't want to get, I don't want to get any, I don't want to, I don't know. I can't remember

if I'm allowed to, or if I was asked not to say this or not, here's what I'll say.

I share something with the top streamers on this platform, like the top top.

And I don't know why, but I think that association is kind of, they were kind of forced. They didn't

force, but they, they kind of had to invite me autism. No baldness. No.

Seven evil muffins just resubbed for 57 months. Is it like how in middle school,

your mom always made you invite the special ed kid to your birthday party,

even though you didn't want to.

So, so yeah. So I, I don't think they, I don't think that maybe that's why it was fan fan that

reached out. Uh, but, uh, but I, I, I, I don't think that it was, they, they kind of wanted to,

I just, they just didn't realize that I was going to be in a certain group and they couldn't like,

be like, oh yeah, everybody, but him. I'm not a DEI invite you dipshit. They didn't do it because

they had, no, it's not DEI. This isn't diversity. It's, it's, it's literally, it's like, it's like,

it's like storage wars, right?

You go in and you buy, uh, that was all fake, but you buy something and it's like, there's,

everything's good in there, but then you get a fucking like a lemon, you know what I mean?

But you don't throw the whole box out. You're like, well, fuck it. It might as well, you know,

oldest streamer award. That's just rude. Reminds me of like, when you're playing and mom forces,

you include your sibling, Daniela. I never, ever, ever check my DMS ever on anything.

And I happen to be, I happen to go on Instagram this morning and I clicked,

on messages and I saw one from somebody named Daniela. And I'm like, that can't be the Daniela.

I know, right? That can't be the, that can't be the Daniela. I know is it, it is a Daniela. I know.

And it's a video of a girl in a wheelchair showing what she did for Halloween this year.

This is what you DM me. And then I found out one of the most horrible things ever. I am friends

with a few people on discord or on,

Instagram just because it's, you know, it's the polite thing to do when you meet other streamers.

And I noticed I had a DM with a streamer that I know, a Spanish streamer named,

Dear Gia. And we knew each other from Amsterdam, never talked outside of, you know,

just meeting and stuff like that. But it was just one of those ones where it's like,

you get to know somebody and it's like, Hey, listen, if we ever have a collab or we ever do

this, let's do that. I have this, a lot of people on that. And I noticed that I had a DM with her.

And I'm like, that's weird. And I'm, I had sent a message. I'm like, I've never DM her.

And I looked and it was a video that I had shared in discord of a woman who it was a video of years.

I've been pregnant. And it's like 1998, 99, 2000, 2001. It was like 22 years. And it was

something that I was making. I sent this to her completely out of the blue, never messaged each

other, send this video. I didn't send it. I don't know how it got sent. I have,

no idea how it got sent, but the first ever after five years, the first ever DM is a video

of a woman going years. I got pregnant. This did, did, did, did, did, did, did no context, nothing.

And I look like the biggest fucking, I even said, why the hell did this get sent to you? And what is

it? I've never messaged you before. I had to delete the shit. I just sent this woman, this video. It's

so, so weird. And now I look like a fucking part view profile. What you guys don't know. Dear Gia,

okay. You know what? Literally just somebody I, as you can see there. Okay. All right. Just stop

guys. Um, also this guy named Delaware realtor DMs me and goes, love your, uh, love your work

King. Longtime Tik TOK follower. I said, thanks. Are you trying to sell me a house here in Delaware?

Easily. Dude's fucking trying to sell me a house props to the hustle. Okay. Guys, guys, this is

not a message board right now. Please stop.

Guys. Okay. Guys, I really need you to stop right now. I was just, I was just trying to make a point.

I don't check a lot of these things. Little ugly dude. Okay. Just stop. Channing Tatum follows me.

So I was like, thanks for the follow dude. And he ghosted me. I fucked, I fucked up already with

one DM by accident that I didn't even mean to meant to send. I don't want to. Okay. I should

probably stop scrolling through my shit. Probably a misclick when you accidentally follow and they

respond before you can unfollow people.

Thank each other for follows. I mean, sometimes when somebody does that, you're like, yo man,

thanks for the follow. Like, appreciate it. It's like fishing. You know what I mean? And if they

say, Hey, no problem. Love your shit. And you're like, Hey man, we'd love to do something sometime

or Hey man, I love your shit too. You know, like you have to, you have to have a conversation.

My wife is always wondering why our kids don't have friends. And I'm like, well, that's because

we've got it in, you know, talk to other parents and get to know them and then invite and stuff

like that. Well, but why don't they do it? They never do it. How come they don't? Because they're

probably doing the same thing. Well, I don't want to do it because they're going to do it.

I said, sometimes you got to take initiation in life though. Sometimes you got to shoot your shot.

You got to be, you know, you got to be tasteful with it, but you can't go through life. Not

doing that. Wondering what could have been, what do I do? If the dude says something back,

it's like, Hey man, cool. We get a conversation going. If he doesn't say anything, at least I

shot my shot. If he unfollows me, at least I shot my shot. Follow for follow. No, it's not

follow for a follow. You're looking tight today. Stocky. What does it even mean? All right. Rivian

still popping. Oh, and then he's following the line so far. It's probably going to go lower.

Watch this shit go to 34 bucks. So far going again. Nice. How do you decide when a stock is

oversold? Um, you don't, I mean, you can use what other people use identifier is as oversold.

My, you know, you know, if something's oversold or overbought, it's like, it's just what you think

other people are going to think. That is the market we are in. You know what I mean? Like

what you think other people are going to think that have more money that can, that can move the

position.

More than you. It's not what you think. NVO based on book value and it's, it's, it's balance sheet

is probably the most oversold stock in the stock market right now, but nobody else wants to be

involved in it right now because there's too many, there's too many headwinds in the future. There's

too much money to be made elsewhere. Right. And you know, overbought, I mean, you know,

Palantir, according to traditional indicators, it's the most overbought stock in the entire

stock market, but it keeps going higher. So it really doesn't matter. That's why you don't

even do it. RSI, fuck RSI. RSI doesn't matter anymore.

If it was RSI, everybody would be, here's the thing about TA indicators. If TA indicators were,

you know, such a guarantee, then everybody who uses them would be banking. It's not,

it's one tool in a tool bag, right? Using TA is great because you're identifying what other

people may be identifying. Are you, but, but it's, are they identifying the same one? Are

they going after MACD while you're going after Fibonacci retracement? Or are you doing RSI?

Are they doing Bollinger? You don't know. There's so many different things. Anybody

can at any time doing that. There may be people who are offloading a position because they want

to, they want to buy the dip on something else. Like let's say SoftBank, for example. SoftBank

is unloading NVIDIA. They're saying it's because they want to invest in other AI things. Your

NVIDIA line could have been perfect and it's about to bounce off of that. Then SoftBank says,

we're dumping 5.3 billion. And your TA doesn't work. So it can work. It can help, but it can't

be something that people, so when I hear people say, oh, look, the TA worked, the TA worked,

the TA worked. I'm like, yeah, show me all the times it didn't work. Well, it technically did.

It's just a, did a retracement because it fell through the RSI, but the MACD indicated that it

had to touch the lower Bollinger band and the Fibonacci retracement. So if you look at, if you

forget the first thing I said, and the second, it does attack the third. So technically it's like,

bro, I get it. I get it. I use TA. I make up my own TA, but I use TA. There is fine TA,

but there are people that swear by TA. They say, oh, well, you know, always buy off the nine day

moving average, or if the nine day crosses the 50, then sell. If the 50 crosses the 200, buy.

I mean, it, if it, if it works so perfectly, it would always work. The problem is, is that the

market isn't controlled by us. Okay. It's not controlled by any individual. It's, there's so

many different things. It's being controlled by robots and programs now, but there's so many

different factors. You could be absolutely right in your analysis. 100%. Somebody who has a bigger

position that has way more money decides they need to move that money elsewhere. Even if it's a good

stock, you're wrong. Or if they buy the dip and you're shorting it. Okay. There's nothing wrong

with TA. But if I hear somebody saying,

TA, if you'll be profitable, as long as you fall, always fall the TA, then I'm like, it's the same,

it's the same as a crypto bro saying, oh, there is no downside to Bitcoin. It's only upside,

right? Like it's, it's like, you know, the same thing. I'm the same way. You know, I, I, I, I trade

off of fucking catalyst fundamentals sometimes and gut feeling and it works until it doesn't,

you know what I mean? It, it, it, they're, they're, you're, you're, if you're trading,

you're gambling. You know what I mean? We try to sound like we know what we're talking about,

we sound smarter, but it's not that way. That's why buying and holding is the best way.

Let's short this Ponzi. No one has lost more money than people who short the market.

Didn't you say yesterday that retail is in control? Retail. They're not in control. They

have more control of the market. They're in control of, of, of, of, of the reason why certain

positions don't move like they used to. But you're talking, it's like trying to herd cats.

It's like saying, well, the cats are in control. All right. They're in control. Okay. At least

one of y'all have had an old person on your street die and didn't get picked up and didn't

get figured out for two weeks later. It turned out the cats fucking ate them. Okay. The cats

are in control, but that doesn't mean you have control of the cats. You see what I mean? All

my calls are worth one cent. What the fuck are you doing? What are you taking? Zero day options.

I'm not, I'm not shaming. I'm just, I'm just curious. Do you have any sector company

suggestions for long-term cybersecurity sector? I think it's heavily undervalued. I still think,

if, if the market continues up, Google still, even at this price is still

close to fair value compared to the others, but still a value pick. Uh, if you're looking

for long-term, I still think SoFi has a lot of growth in it. Um, there's a lot.

Speed Rose has gifted us up to Red Hero. Happy Veterans Day, Stocky. I got to do a whiteboard

on, um, all the places offering stuff. Okay. I'm gonna be real with you. I drew this line

like 15 minutes ago. If it bounces here, which I don't think it will, but if it does,

we're shutting down the lines. Okay.

Cure's still going guys. We're at 101 on Cure, by the way. Any stocks you think will go up 5%

this week? Oscar. Are cybersecurity companies that profitable? You think profit matters in

this market? Let me show you a company that doesn't make any money. Okay. Let me show you

another company that makes no money that we got into when it was 15 bucks. Sorry. We got into it

at 16 bucks. That's a 3000% return since September of last year. This, this is, this is, this isn't,

it's unfortunate that you can't grasp the market. And that's why people, including me,

I'm still evolving with the market, but people have a hard time wrapping their head around this

because they're like, this shouldn't be happening. And the answer is why not? Because it's not

supposed to. According to what? The way the market has always been. The market is always changing.

This is the market now. Okay. The way, the way the stock market acted in 1995 and 2005 and

15 was new and shouldn't be happening, but there were changes, you know? I mean, there was a time

when you, you, you wanted to buy a stock. You had to fucking send a telegram or send a fucking

letter to a pony express to go to the nearest fucking town with a telegram and had to telegram

that shit to fucking, you know, some city. And then they had to have a little paper boy go

hurry, hurry, run to the fucking stock market exchange, go in there and get tipped a penny.

And, and then they take it to the,

to the floor. And then by then the stock has moved. They don't know what the stock price is.

They fucking screw over the guy in fucking middle America and fucking take a 20% commission on that

shit. And then fucking send the boy back and send it back. And like three days later, he's like,

yeah, you own a share. And he's like, yay, we own stocks. And then the next day, a fucking

wagon train shows up and like, we're here to take your home and your child, children and your,

your oxen. Why? Your stock is worthless. What do you mean? I just bought it.

Sir, it's been two weeks. That business is no longer here and you owe us money. But, but I,

how do I know this is real? Get off your land and, or we will kill you. But where do I go?

Out there, son. But, but, but that, that's, that's engine land. Well, you best be getting

engine your way off this property because we, we ain't, we, we digging for oil.

Can I invest in your oil? You sure can.

Okay. I'm sorry. I'm blacking out. I was about to go on a whole fucking rant here, but,

but you know, I mean like, like, you know, that's, that, then all of a sudden we had a fucking

telephone, you know, and then we had high speed rail and then, and then there was, there was,

you know, cell phones and then there was computers and then there was fax machines and shit like

that. Stock, he had multiple more characters ready to go there. Yeah. I was about to bust out, uh,

uh, uh, old, uh, you know, chief fucking NASDAQ.

Or whatever, like how, you know, but I didn't want to go too far. Cause I'm going to take this

story forever. What's the future method. Everybody trying to make bots to, to, to, to counteract bot.

We had some guys that just got, uh, a mistrial after being found guilty, uh, for, uh, stealing

$25 million worth of crypto. And the reason that they're, they got in trouble was they found out

that there were bots that were going out there that were putting up, asking a bid at these crazy

fast levels. And then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and

making them disappear and adding them to, to mess with the price, to, to scout people to on buys

and sells to screw up the order fills. Right. And so they developed a bot to, to scout those bots

and made $25 million in 12 seconds. It's true story. True story. Okay. Okay. Look at this.

This is a stocky daily news from, um, from yesterday. I think I'm just going to Google

it very quicker. Let me give you guys the actual article here. Um, all right. Uh,

um, all right, here you go. Um, all right, here you are. Uh, this is, uh, this is from,

from literally just, I think yesterday or, um, I really wish I had this ready to go.

Fuck. Why do I not have this ready to go? Where is it? I had it in my news section.

Why the hell is Trump trying to sue the BBC? You know why he's trying to bait a political

conversation? Well, that's actually in today's, uh, in today's news, but, um,

all right, so here you go. Two brothers were arrested for attacking the Ethereum blockchain

is from back in 2024. And so what we ended up having is, uh, um, they got a mistrial for this.

Okay. And so this was the original thing. This is from the department of justice. I don't even

want to give the department of justice one, but basically, uh, they allegedly carried out, uh,

this, uh, what they're seeing is they stole 25 million cryptocurrency. They're accused of using

their computer science and mask skills to exploit vulnerabilities in the Ethereum blockchain,

specifically about altering pending transactions to steal funds.

Uh, they're poorly a 12 second window. They arrested in 2024 charged with wire fraud and

money laundering. Okay. Now they, um, they just got a mistrial. And so what you're seeing is,

is, is, is the future is now, right? At some point, it's just going to be automation. It's

going to be automation. You know what I mean? And so it's not going to be worth trying to

beat the bots. You know what I mean? Now you could take advantage of them, or you could kind of sit

and watch trends and evolve with the market and kind of follow it. Cause right now you're, you're,

you're watching, you know, hedge funds, battle it out. You're seeing, uh, uh, you know, companies

battled out and you're kind of sitting back trying to gauge it. You can do that. It's just how fast

does, do we, do we, uh, evolve during that timeframe? The clankers are going to win.

Well, the stock market has always been rigged. It's rigged in your favor. If you get out of

your own way. Okay. I know you're trying to bait a, um, a, uh,

a political conversation, but, uh, here's the thing. It's not even really politics.

It's the whole sector of, uh, of news organizations and entertainment. Um,

Trump has already won about a hundred million dollars in settlements from Google meta, uh,

and other news organizations, uh, suing them. Part of it is because of the power he has as

president. So it feels like a lot of these things should have been, uh, moved off until he was not

in office anymore because it feels like there's a, a power dynamic there. Half the times,

I think Trump is just being a baby about it. Okay. Oh no, they said something to hurt my

feelings. The BBC one. On the other hand, I actually, like I said, I'm the type of person

who I don't care who you are. I will call you out when you're, when, when, when it's something that

you're doing that's bullshit. I'll also call out or admit when something is done, right. Or is,

is, is, is against you. I'm not going to play that game where everything has to be one or the other.

I hate when people do that. Like if you, if you voted for Trump,

you should be able to, to, you should be very willing to criticize him. And if you voted against

him and you hate him, but you, but something positive comes, you got to at least acknowledge

that, Hey, listen, I fucking hate the guy. I still hate the guy. I think he's a fucking horrible

piece of shit, but that was something good that came, came out right now. You got to be able to

do that as a human being or else you'll, you'll fucking lose your mind. This is one of those

cases for me, the BBC thing. I actually agree that there's a case here. Okay. I actually agree

that there's a case here and I'll show you why. Now,

in this case, he's saying that he wants to settle with them, or if they don't settle with him,

he's going to sue them for a billion dollars. That's a whole other can of worms, but let me

show you what they're actually suing for. Okay. Um, and I have a hard time. I have a hard time

believing anybody will see this and say, nah, that's totally, that's totally legit. Whatever.

I hate to say it because you'll accuse me of being some fucking MAGA glorping fucking whatever. And

that's more, more telling on you than it is me. But let me show you the side-by-side comparison.

This is a documentary and the documentary wasn't even that critical of him, but this is what they

put in the, in the, in the, in the BBC documentary versus the original thing. And we fight, we fight

like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.

That's what they put. We're going to walk to the Capitol. We're going to cheer on senators and

congressmen and women. And we fight, we fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell,

you're not going to have a country anymore.

And to the person who just said the worst liar is suing for editing. No one's taking away that

Trump is full of shit, that he lies and that he slanders all the time. No one's taking that away,

but you got to stop with the what about isms, right? We'll just get it right. I'm saying in

this case, I'm going to be real with you. I actually understand it. The context is the same.

Are you serious? And there you go, ladies and gentlemen, I told you there will be people that

cannot separate anything.

This isn't about, is Trump good? Is he bad? Is this, is this, you know, uh, did he, did, did he,

what he do that day lead to the January 6th riot? No one is denying that. No one is denying that.

Go on. You thought you got sus, but go on, go ahead, King. I'm still waiting for you to tell

me how, what they did in this documentary doesn't constitute what, what, what this is.

I agree with you a hundred percent. I agree with you a hundred percent. I agree with you a hundred

percent. Trump is a liar. Trump, Trump slanders. Trump does all that. I agree with that, but

please tell me from just separating your emotions for a second, how you wouldn't also in this case,

because remember you can't separate the fact that, Oh my God, stocky. Oh my God, stocky.

You can't say something if it's in a positive light or, or even if it's an agreement with

Trump in any little matter, can't do it. Tell me I gave you, I gave you all of it. Go for it.

I know you,

used to streamers who don't, don't have these kinds of like open, you know, talks and, and,

and, and, and using facts and logic and, and, and actually seeing how something else we're talking

about from the letter of the law, not how you feel about the person that's, that's doing it.

He didn't answer, did he? He just said his piece and left. Okay. All right. So as I was saying,

um, in this case, I can see that there is a case separate that from being Trump,

put anybody else in there. You see what they did there.

So to the guy who wanted to get this going, um, uh, you know, uh, you know, you, you, that's,

you got a political discussion, but it's not about the politics. I'm not talking about the

politics of it. Nothing I said here was about the politics of it. I'm talking about the legal case

about it. And so I'm not a lawyer. Okay. I A N A L I am not a lawyer, but from a legal case standpoint,

uh, I understand where people would say that there is,

the case here because in this documentary, in this specific documentary, in this specific clip,

yeah, it was edited to, to make it seem, you know, but the context was the same.

Great. Go argue that in front of a judge. That's not what we're talking about. Okay.

That's textbook misinformation. No, it's not. This is called disinformation.

Misinformation is when you do it unintentionally. Disinformation is when you do it intentionally.

So again, I think, I think it has nothing to do with,

with Trump in this case. I think Trump, 100%, I think Trump's speech that day to a crowd of people

that were already riled up was a stroking point of, and almost like a green light for people who

were already ready to do their thing. It absolutely was a catalyst for, for the riots on January 6th.

100%. Now what? We're not talking about that. We're talking about the legality of the case.

There's no way to establish intent.

Are you, are you a lawyer who specializes in this? Cause I would, I would, I would think,

and if I was on a jury and I saw this and they said, this was intentionally edited to make it

seem like it was leading to what happened that day as a more direct result or a direct call to action

as opposed to what originally was in there. And why was it edited the way it was? If not for that,

I could see them having a case. I don't know. If you take away Trump from this,

we'd be having a different conversation.

I think it's pretty easy to say.

See what the intent is there. You're stroking Trump. No, I'm not. I've done this for a million

different, a hundred different people that way. If the case was the same, somebody asked me about

the headline today and I'm answering it. I'm able to separate the, that part from it.

Stocky is like the most libertarian dude, LMAO. It's painful sometimes, bro. You think I'm

libertarian? Then you don't know what, you don't think what a libertarian is. Oh shit. I don't

think fucking everybody in America showed a goddamn fucking fully automatic machine gun.

What are you talking about? I don't think the, the federal,

government should be fucking dissolved. What are you talking about? Dumbass.

So if you're going to establish that the speech was a call to action, the edit was just,

would be justified as highlighted the portion of speech that specifically contained radicalizing

message. Okay. You guys are trying to now, now, now I'm getting baited. I'm saying that of all

of the lawsuits that this administration has put forward, this is the one that I see that would be

the best case of a direct edit in a way that completely change it from, we're going to go

cheer them on to, we're going to go down there and we're going to fight like hell. You know, I can

see what, okay. You know what? I'm not, I'm getting baited. I'm getting baited. I was even going to

bring this up because this happened to me. Did you know you can just not talk? Okay. Let's see

how that works. Creep, creep, creeping cancer. Here you go. All right. Now that we're done with

that guy, he got his attention. Moving on. I was actually going to show you that this actually

happened to me one time. No, I wasn't giving a rally on January 6th inciting a fucking riot. No,

that's not what I was doing.

But I actually had a company do a retraction. Y'all remember that? The original article contained

misleading information in regard to one of the stock guys' Twitch stream. Hold ourselves a higher

standard. Therefore, we hold ourselves accountable to unintentional misinformation. We apologize for

extreme oversight. We'll take measures necessary to prevent such incidents. This happened.

No. Gotta love. Gotta love. I actually love whenever we have a talk about something and it

evolves.

Especially a politician. It's like, hey, this case that this administration is doing may be the

first one that I say, oh my God, they actually have a case. People lose their mind. Lose their

mind. One guy in chat even said, oh, you think that we should say positive things about people

we hate? No, I didn't say positive things. I said you have to be able to at least understand when

something good happens. You can't be like, I don't care if that's good. It's bad because of the

regardless, right? And the person in chat goes, name five things that you think are positive.

Five things that the leaders of Germany did good in the 1940s. That's what we face in today's

society. That's what we face in today's society. And they're the same people that will complain

about the political climate we're in. And they're the worst offenders. They're the reason it is the

way it is. I'm going to continue doing what I do. I will talk without all the noise. You can play

your team sport. I'm going to talk about things from an analytical standpoint. All right. Where

was I?

Is this actually, no, this has been 45 minutes and it's followed it. No. Can you tell me how to

do blurbs? I think there's a little thing on, um, on the screen that you can either make one and

then do it, or you can find one that's already out there without editing. Do you think that speech

was incitement? Are you acting me from, you're asking me from a legal standpoint with that

constitute incitement? The truth is I've never listened to his whole speech, but

from what I have listened to, and it doesn't matter what my opinion is, but from what I have,

what I have, what I have heard, regardless of the exact words, he said, seeing that crowd being

there, the words that were said leading up to it and knowing, knowing that that crowd is, is, is on

edge, knowing that they're very rabidly, uh, uh, following and, and loyal to you and saying things,

even if you don't say it directly, I 100% would say that,

the context, even without saying the right words, I would say that you did, I'll put it this way.

He didn't do anything to deescalate for sure. 100%. I would personally say, yeah, he, there's no way

he didn't know that his words were going to maybe not cause that, but we're going to exacerbate the

situation. There's, you can't play dumb with that. There's no way you can see the rhetoric that he

was using up to. And at that point, seeing the crowd there,

saying the words he said and not say that that led to, or had a part in what took place. There's

a hundred percent. And at the, at the, at the, at the, at the nicest possible way, or the easiest

way of trying to get around it is saying at the very, very least, he did nothing to deescalate

a situation that he knew was already intense. I'll leave it at that because from a legal standpoint,

I can't, I can't, you know, I can't use a legal and say, yeah, a hundred percent. But what I will

tell you, and we were watching this, we were watching this, we were watching this, we were

watching it. We watched it that day on stream. We watched it live and we made some fucking good

money on, on January 6th off of that shit. I know that sounds horrible and I'm not taking away from

what happened, but I'm just telling you that the situation happened. We watched it live and we're

like, fuck it. We're buying gun and drone stocks. And that shit mooned as soon as they fucking

stormed the Capitol. I know that that sounds fucking terrible. I understand it, but the

situation was happening and you can call me whatever you want, but I saw an opportunity

and I took it. It wasn't,

it's not like if I didn't do that, they would have all put peacefully put down their fucking

or put everything down and walked away. What was the stocks we made money on? We played, um,

was it UAVS and Smith and Wesson or was it something else? Or Axon? No, it was Axon.

Axon body cam and, uh, the drone stock. UAP something. I'm not Lord of War. You see an

opportunity, you take it. You know that the moment that something like that happens, there's going to

be a response and who is going to benefit from it. I'm not Lord of War. I'm not Lord of War. I'm not

from that. That's what you do. You know what I mean? Okay. When the, when the BLM riots were

happening, we shorted retail stores and, and long gun stocks. We made money on both. I mean, that's

just, that's just, you, you, you, you understand how, how anticipation happens. We played the

storage court, uh, container companies on evictions. That's true too. When the moratorium

ended, we played U-Haul and storage companies off of people getting evicted and we made money

off of that too. You may say, you may say that that makes me a bad person. I don't know. I don't

know. I'm a bad person. It doesn't, at least not to me. I'm not kicking people out and then making

money off of them. I see something happening and I decide this is the company that's going to

benefit. I'm not rooting on the evictions. I'm not personally going door to door. I mean, if I was

down on my options, I might help them out. But like, you know, I see something happening and I

say, this is the next move. I'm going to get into it. I'm into SoFi heavy. I was already into SoFi

heavy, but the BBB, I think the BBB, the, the, the bill is absolute fucking utter trash.

But I see that they are cutting student loan governments, uh, uh, uh, you know, back student

loans. I see that they're doing that. It means that their colleges aren't going to lower the

prices, but students are going to have to move to private lenders to supplement it. And SoFi spent

the money to, to, to get everybody on their, their, their, their, their thing. And then they're

going to make, I see what's happening. I don't want people to have to spend more on their loans,

but if they are, that's, who's going to benefit. Not a bad person, just a capitalist.

That's not even a capitalist thing. That's just somebody

in a position you think in a, in a, in a, in a socialist, uh, government when it basically

becomes a fascism, but, but you, you don't think that the people at the top aren't doing that.

You don't think in a communism with an, with an, uh, with an oligarchy, you know, that, that there's

not that, that they do the same thing. It's just, it's just in our society, we have the ability to

do it too. Okay. That's the, that's, that's one of the differences. Okay. You can't pretend that

a non-capitalist society, everyone is a fucking utopian and a human being. Humans are shit.

Humans are shit. And people look to, to, to, to find advantages where they can.

Opportunist would be a better description. Exactly. Thanks for 20% on any, there is no way.

Okay. I'm not even kidding you. I drew that fucking line on a one minute chart on a $2 billion

company 20 minutes ago, 20 minutes ago. Remember when I said, fuck your TA. Okay. We're, we're

going to move off of this. Okay. And my weeklies are printing. Okay, bro. You drew it as a joke

because someone asked. Yeah, exactly. It's a joke. Remember when we did that on spy on Friday,

when spy was getting absolutely destroyed. And that one guy said that he's quitting the stock

market and he's glad he's out because he can't stand this anymore. And I was like, that's crazy.

Cause I think it's about to reverse here. And I drew the line. It ended up being the exact bottom.

The S and P 500 jumped from six 61 to six 82.

In 24 hours. I think we broke salmon. He's gone. No, I think salmon's here under a different name.

All right. We got to run marbles from marbles. And then I got a couple of things I wanted to go over.

I wanted to go over. I'm starting to like, I know this sounds bad, but I'm starting to like when I

touch on a topic that shouldn't be that controversial, but is, and watching people

just fucking lose their minds. Like it's so easy. And it's not even baiting people.

It's like just having a fucking rational take on something and watching people lose their minds.

I love it. I think I'm starting to like it. And that's scary. Do you buy any dips today? Uh,

just a EHR soundhound looks really, really good too. People have already lost their, their mind.

You just give them a route to exhaust on. That's fair. Let's, uh, let's run marbles and then let's,

uh, let's get with, uh, with the trades and stuff like that, or the trades with the, uh, with the

news. Um, I got a couple of things I got to go over with. I'm not doing my second sponsored

segment today, but I do have a meeting after stream.

With them. Can I get a follow on Instagram? Did you win marbles? No, then shut the fuck up.

FTNT's still going. That was a really good buy. I think it's cybersecurity is just too much,

too, too much of a, of a value play right now. FTNT's drop, even with their subscription,

uh, revenue being slightly down was just an insane, uh, easy, easy, uh, um, I did what the

fuck? Wait, who asked the question? What was the question you asked? You taking a play out

of Asmongold's book? No, I won't defend something that I, I know is wrong just for,

just for likes. That's what the political streamers do. They will legitimately know

deep down that, that something is wrong, but they will find any way to fucking justify it

because they, it's just insane. Okay. Let's do it. Marbles. Let's go. All right. Get in,

get in, get in. Uh, uh, a lot of sex. What? No. Sex is extra. What does that say? Whatever.

Congrats on your win. Am I going to have to come up there again? I'm going to start handing out

timeouts like they're candy.

Oh, hell no. I just heard something hit the ground. Everything okay up there? Boy,

she lays a hand on one of the, getting quiet now. Okay. Okay. What? Did you just say thank

you for your service? No. If you want to thank me for my service, you'll let me stick it. Uh,

all right, let's go guys. No guys, this is not a, they did not do this live together.

Not going to lead. Never, not going to lie. Never seen a team leader take a shower.

You think I'm a team leader? Would you trust me to lead anything? Please. Somebody said I look

like Hunter Biden if he relapsed. True. True. Crack is cleaner than Coke though. Okay. All right.

Since we talk about money and saving it here, even though I do not participate, Jesus, what

happened to spy? Fuck it. This isn't a shit coin guys. This is the S and P 500. Um, even though I

don't participate, I still feel that it is only right. I don't feel like I'm going to win. I don't

feel like I'm going to win. I don't feel like I'm going to win. I don't feel like I'm going to win.

For me to, um, to give you guys the, the, the breakdown here. All right. So if you are a

veteran and you want to take advantage of, I don't want to say take advantage. If you want to

utilize the, uh, free meals that are given out today. Okay. I'm holding up my expensive

okay, listen. All right. I appreciate it, bro. But like, I don't swing that way yet. All right.

Why are there tiny little feet on my board? Just tiny ass little foot right here.

And no, it's not my foot. What do you mean yet? I'm just saying like, you know, I, they, you know,

you never know. Things can change. You know what I mean? People can change. I don't know. I doubt,

I don't think it's going to happen, but like, you just can't rule things out. All right.

Okay?

Damn, NVO fucking running today.

Is Twin Peaks a good first date?

Good way to find out what kind of woman she is.

Have you checked out Longwood Gardens yet?

No, not yet.

We haven't really taken the kids many places

because we're trying to get them healed up.

Because they've been sick.

I do want to take them.

Please post the link.

I can post this link.

Yeah.

First time chatter.

I've been learning order flow for the past two weeks.

Do you think it's worthwhile?

Honestly, what works for one person

may not for another and vice versa.

So I can't say that it will or won't work.

It really depends on your strategy

and how you implement it.

I think anything that you put all your cards in one,

put all your eggs in one basket,

I think you're doomed for failure.

But utilizing it as a tool,

if you do it correctly,

it's going to take implementation and time

and understanding.

Just because somebody has a large order

does not mean that it's guaranteed

that that's going to move.

Sometimes it's a hedge.

Like a lot of people will see

that they'll see a large put order come in

and they'll think,

oh, that means the market,

somebody thinks the market's going to go down.

Sometimes that could be a hedge against a position.

Sometimes it could be a bet on volatility.

So while order flows can be something,

just remember that it's not always a guarantee.

And sometimes you'll only remember the times

where it did work out

and you'll be like,

oh shit, I'll do it every time.

So order flow is a great tool in your tool bag.

Because it does let you know where money is flowing.

Why the money's flowing there is the question.

Order flow is just seeing what people are buying

and selling should work for everybody.

Again, it depends.

If that was the case,

everybody would be billionaires.

You know what I mean?

All right.

What else do we have today?

I wanted to go.

So in the call this morning,

we talked about a few things,

including the Supreme Court rejecting the bid

to overturn the same-sex marriage ruling by Kim Davis.

The Senate passes the compromise package

and the shutdown bill holding the house.

SoftBank, we already talked about.

Norway.

Ladies and gentlemen,

they can go collect all that food

and feed homeless people.

You're absolutely right.

Interesting enough,

about a third of all homeless people in America

are veterans.

Late to party,

wide SoftBank dumping video.

They said that they're basically selling their position

after making all this money

because they want to go out

and fund other AI projects.

Some people are saying,

okay, that makes sense.

You've got all this money

and there's so many other small projects

to invest in to make more money.

Others are saying they think it's a top.

You won't know.

All right.

It's so sad how many veterans are left

to survive on the streets.

Yeah.

I mean,

I think it's getting better,

but when I was in the military,

it was much worse when it was years ago.

There was no transition.

It was your time is up.

Have a good life.

And interesting enough,

I did well in the military.

I mean, I wasn't like a good,

a good, you know, guy.

I wasn't like good for the military

because like I fucked up a lot,

but like the military was good for me.

Somebody said,

somebody said,

severe like clinical ADHD

because I knew where I had to be

when I had to be there,

what my job was, right?

Like there was no,

like just figure it out on your own.

There was like,

this is what you have to do.

And there's immediate consequences, right?

So somebody like me,

I will put off things

if there's not an immediate consequence,

if I don't get them done, right?

If I don't answer this email right now,

it's like, it's fine.

I can answer it tomorrow, right?

But tomorrow turns into the next month.

And then by the time

it does turn into immediate consequences,

there's a million things

and it's a problem.

But if there's an immediate consequence,

I always get it done, right?

Pick up my kids on time.

I wake up on time.

I start my stream at the same time.

I do my morning call at the same time.

Things like that,

I have to do

because it's immediate consequence.

In the military,

there was a structure.

I knew where I had to be,

when I had to be,

what I was supposed to say,

what I was supposed to do,

when, whatever.

That was what it was.

It worked out well for me.

And so for a lot of people,

they go into that.

And if they don't have something lined up

outside the military,

it's just like,

it's like somebody goes into a house

in, you know,

in their house in America, right?

And they walk,

they're outside in the field.

They're outside in the yard.

They walk up.

They open the door.

They go in the house.

They sit there.

They do their thing.

They go out the back door

and all of a sudden,

they're in the fucking Arctic tundra

and the door's locked behind you.

You're not ready for that.

You don't have the skills to,

you know, whatever.

You didn't spend all that time inside

building skills

to survive in the Arctic tundra

or in the desert or whatever.

Like, it's just a different world.

And so, you know, you're young.

You're 18.

You're 18 years old.

You go in.

You're shaped as a man or a woman

with this, you know,

this is what you do,

where you go.

You understand.

You understand there's always a schedule.

There's a person.

There's a chain of command.

You know, who reports to you,

who you report to,

who has the authority,

what they say,

what matters,

you know, what the consequences are.

You just have that thing.

Then you drop them off into the world

and the world is in a very unforgiving place.

It doesn't work.

It doesn't work that way.

And so what happens is,

is a lot of people don't know what to do.

Where do you go from there?

Right?

Where do you go from there?

Some people would call it institutionalized, right?

Like, where do you go from there?

Shut up for a second.

Where do you go from there?

There's no, there's no guiding.

There's no transition period.

It's good luck.

And if you don't have a family

or networking or a job lined up,

you don't, you know what I mean?

You don't have somewhere to go there.

You don't have a specific field

that you could transition out.

Right?

And if you don't get a job right out,

you're just lost.

Now, you may say,

well, tell me how that's different

from going to college, Stocky.

Well, college is much different

because college,

you have to kind of figure out things on your own.

You're progressing through it.

You're applying to places on the way

while you're, you know, you're working jobs.

You're networking.

You're getting to know people.

You're using your degree to leverage

and stuff like that.

It's not the same.

Plus, while you're there,

you've got your connections

and you're just kind of like

experiencing the world

and kind of morphing with it.

It's not like you're in an institution

and then you're put out.

And so, they don't prepare you for that.

Colleges have resources to help you get a job

and how to apply

and how to do interviews

and get your resume

and do all that shit.

The military, it was just,

all right, your service ends in a week.

Here's your terminal leave.

Good luck.

So, a lot of veterans end up

trying to get jobs

and it doesn't work out

or they don't make enough money

and, you know,

or they've got PTSD

or they're just not ready for that.

And so, what ends up happening is,

is they turn to substances.

You have a lot of downtime.

You don't know what to do with yourself.

You end up doing something that numbs it,

whether it's doing drugs,

drinking alcohol,

whether it's gambling,

whether it's doing high-risk activities

because that's the only way for you to like

feel like you have some control.

The problem is that you lose control of that thing

and that thing starts to control you.

And now,

you were barely getting by before,

but now you're an addict,

you don't have,

that's it.

And no one gives you a pamphlet

telling you about the resources

that are available to you.

So, you're just left.

You're just forgotten about.

And so,

once that happens,

remember what I told you,

the longer someone is homeless,

the less likely they are to ever get out of that.

And so,

in this country,

I told you,

we have the money to deal with this.

We're not underfunded at the VA.

We're severely mismanaged.

It's like the homeless problem in America.

We have the money to deal with it.

We're just mismanaged.

Also,

we have to make hard decisions.

I already told you what my plan would be.

People don't like it.

It's not popular.

People hate me for it.

I don't give a shit.

You want me to solve the problem?

That's how you get it done.

Okay?

Or you could just continue doing what we're doing

and we keep throwing more and more money at it

and it's just not,

it's getting worse and worse and worse.

Okay?

LOL.

What's the plan?

You stop spreading your resources out so thin.

You say,

we have to hyper focus all of our money,

time, and efforts on the near,

newly,

and recent homeless.

Because those are the people you have to stop

from getting further down the line.

Once people get six months a year,

two years, five years homeless,

they're not coming back from that.

One in a hundred,

one in a thousand maybe.

But you're letting so many people get from

the people that have the chance to get back in

before they get too far.

You're not focusing there

because you're spreading yourself so thin

that more of these people move down here.

Now you're throwing money,

more money at this

with the chances of it so unlikely to happen

while you're missing out on what has to happen here.

That makes sense.

Not sure why it's unpopular.

Because it means leaving people behind.

It means not spending the resources

on the people who have been homeless

for a very long time.

Nobody wants to do that.

Nobody wants to do that.

It's political suicide.

Politicians don't give a fuck about poor people.

They only care about poor people during the election

because it sounds like they care

and they have a soft heart.

They don't care about poor people

because poor people don't pay taxes.

Or sorry, homeless people.

They don't care about homeless people

because homeless people don't pay taxes

and homeless people don't vote.

They don't give a fuck about homeless people.

But they're going to pretend to do it

because it sounds a good thing.

It sounds like they care.

So during election time,

they talk about homeless people.

Look at California.

I'm not shitting on California,

but California's mismanagement

of funds for homeless people

is something to be studied for decades.

It is insane.

They were once paying $150,000 a year

to house homeless people in apartments.

In studio apartments.

People that have been homeless

for four or five years.

And guess what?

Once that year was up,

they were all homeless again.

I'm not saying that we should

let homeless people, you know, suffer.

But that $150,000,

they could have split that up

with people that were about to be homeless

that just lost their job

and have kids and stuff like that

and say, you,

you're getting fired.

You're getting into one of these places.

We're giving you a year.

You have kids to take care of.

You have a,

you have the opportunity to get a job.

You have the,

it's a better,

you know,

that person could have rebounded.

But instead,

we put it on somebody that,

it doesn't,

this is the kind of thing that happens.

And people don't like it

because they're saying,

well, you don't care about people

that have addiction and PTSD

and substance abuse and trauma.

I'm not saying that at all.

I'm saying,

if you want to fix a problem,

you have to make tough decisions.

And what we've been doing isn't working.

So if you want to cry me a fucking river

and say, Stocky,

that's,

that's terrible.

You were homeless.

You did it.

Yeah,

I was homeless for a short period of time,

like homeless,

homeless for a short period of time.

But the resources that were available

were able to give me just enough to get back

and get my head above water

and allow me to continue to go.

But other people in my situation didn't get there

because the resources weren't available

because the resources were spent attempting to do.

You have to focus on the local community,

charities,

you know,

food drives,

food banks,

you know,

shelters that are run by the community

and the people that are there.

But nobody wants to hear,

oh, you're just letting those people be too far gone.

I'm telling you

that if you want to handle a problem like that,

you have to focus on how you prevent that

from continuing or getting bigger.

How do you shrink that in the future?

And if you focus on the people that are about to be at risk,

newly or recently homeless,

and hyper focus your,

and actually fucking,

you know,

audit and make sure everything's going the right way.

Focus on those people

because that's when you prevent them from getting beyond help.

You see what I mean?

There will never be enough resources to solve homelessness

in a capitalistic system.

You think that in other systems there's no homeless people?

Like, I'm not even here to argue the systems.

I feel like that was a dumb take.

Actually, great take on homelessness without gladiator-style fights.

Is this the wrong stream?

No, gladiator-style fights are for old people

and Social Security benefits.

I'm saying that this is how you do it.

So basically, fix the root of the problem

by covering up the symptoms.

Seems reasonable.

But we can't do that

because politicians will not do that

because it will look like they don't care

and that they're not kind and caring of the people.

And so what they do is they can't touch it.

It's the same thing we touched on yesterday with fixing the VA.

The VA is not underfunded.

The VA is fucking horribly mismanaged.

Horribly mismanaged.

Because they're too afraid to actually get the money working where it's supposed to

because they're afraid somebody might get left behind

and it's political suicide

so they just decide to keep throwing more money at it.

So now the taxpayer is putting more burden

and the care is not getting better.

But nobody wants to talk about these things

because they don't want to get voted out.

They don't want to lose it.

Nobody wants to talk about these things.

These are actionable things.

But if you talk about it, you're a bad person.

I don't give a fuck if you think I'm a good or bad person.

Okay?

I'm a doer. I'm not a fucking sayer.

That's what I would do.

Thankfully, nobody's going to give me the fucking reins.

But that's the kind of shit you have to do.

If you want to fucking fix a problem,

you have to do that.

Okay?

It's like if somebody has fucking cancer

and every time they get a fucking lesion or some shit like that,

you put a band-aid on it.

You got to attack the cancer, right?

You don't fucking...

You don't fucking...

You get your arm cut off.

You don't fucking be like,

oh, shit, let's wipe up the blood on the floor.

Oh, let's put a tourniquet on it.

You got to...

You know what I mean?

You got to fix the problem.

But nobody wants to do it

because they're afraid it's going to make them look bad.

2028?

Stocky 2028?

Make feudalism great again?

No, I'm not saying that I am some kind of fucking...

savant or some fucking answer to problems.

I'm just saying that these are the kind of conversations

that need to have,

but nobody wants to have them

because it makes you seem bad.

It makes you seem uncaring, unloving, un-whatever.

And the problems will never fix themselves.

I think you'd be an awesome president.

I don't want to be a politician.

What are your thoughts on struggling farmers?

Which ones?

The one thing that gives farmers money

is the one thing keeping them from making more money.

I sold Coke.

I hope you profited well.

Homeless people and mentally ill people

are both a sign that society is not doing a good job.

That is incorrect.

All you did was do the North...

Guess what?

North Korea didn't have any COVID cases.

North Korea doesn't have any mentally ill people.

North Korea doesn't have homeless people.

Does that mean that their society is doing good?

Fuck you.

What the fuck are you on about, bro?

I'm not even trying to be mean to you,

but what the fuck kind of question is that?

Mentally ill people and homeless people

are a sign that society is doing bad.

So just pretend that people don't have mental illness?

There have been homeless people

since the beginning of fucking time.

What are you talking about?

What utopian...

The only way you're going to get rid of that

is if you fucking exterminate them.

So are we...

Stocky 2028.

Kill all homeless people.

Is that...

Is that what I'm going with now?

Fucking my new slogan.

Stocky 2028.

You know?

Line up homeless...

Sorry.

Line up mentally ill people and fucking...

What are you talking about?

It doesn't work that way.

I agree with you

that

as a society,

especially a society with as much wealth as we have,

it doesn't make sense

that so much of our society

is struggling.

That is a very, very valid point.

But it's the NIMBY attitude.

It's the not-in-my-backyard attitude.

You know what I mean?

I mean, look at...

What's his name?

The...

Newsom, right?

Dude was like

touting about how we're going to take care of the homeless people

and do all that.

All of a sudden,

we got the Olympics coming.

We got President Xi coming.

Fucking take down all the homeless camps

and fucking kick them out, right?

That's how that shit works.

But you can stop...

You're not going to be able to stop homelessness today.

But if you put into actionable plans,

you could potentially

stop it or slow it

or reduce it significantly over time

if you focus on

that pivot point.

You're not going to solve it today.

Right?

But nobody wants to say,

well, we're going to have to leave some to fend for themselves.

You know, or we could...

I just had a new idea.

Fuck it.

Anybody like a good reverse Uno?

Y'all remember the Mariana boat lift?

Let's do a fucking reverse...

Do that.

Fucking put them on a boat.

Because they want to be...

You know, they're going to be outside.

They need to be in some fucking warm climate.

How about we put them all on a boat,

send them to Cuba?

Not like they're going to swim back.

Oh, my God.

Should I do a whiteboard

and a Mariana boat lift sometime?

My grandfather was there for that

during his...

Sentimentally ill to Canada.

But that would just be like...

It's like sending them home.

All right.

Bodhi doing nice, guys.

Bounce back.

Took two tries, but we got there.

Yes, I make jokes about this stuff

and people get upset.

They're like, how can you joke

and make light of serious situations?

Because that's the only way

we're going to fucking talk about it.

The moment you start being serious

about these conversations,

people either drown you out,

get bored with you,

or fight you on it.

Have to make light of it.

It's the only way to actually get

a conversation started.

I'm not saying that I have the perfect,

you know, solution to these things,

but at least it's a solution.

Throwing money at someone

or throwing money at things

does not work.

So when I hear, oh, well,

tax the rich so you can fund things.

Great, cool.

Sure, that's going to work real well.

Right?

How about...

How about not tax the rich

because they're going to get away from it.

Make the rich just pay

what they're supposed to pay,

but also cut your spending.

And then once you do that,

actually fucking manage the money correctly.

But those are three things

that are never going to fucking happen.

So I don't waste my time talking about it.

All politicians love to say blame the rich

because then you're focusing on the people,

them and not the people

mismanaging the money that they do have.

Even if you did get more money,

they just mismanage that too.

They just spend it into oblivion

and mismanage it.

So you're...

And now you're actually probably taking more

out of the economy than you would

helping it get the spending.

Problem is, again, primaries.

I don't want to fucking beat a dead horse here.

There are two types of folks in the world,

prosperity-minded folks

and poverty-minded folks.

That is...

I disagree with that.

I disagree with that.

I think a lot of people

are born in situations

that they cannot get out of.

They can try,

but it's just not possible.

And there are other people

that are stuck in the victim mentality.

When I hear a content creator

or a politician or anybody

tell people that they can't do something

because society is holding them down

or because of rich people

or because of their color of their skin

or their sexual orientation

or their religion or whatever,

I want that person to shut the fuck up

because you're wrong.

And all you're doing is creating a mentality

that that person will never achieve anything in life

because you have told them that they won't

and it's because of an outside factor.

You should be motivating them and saying,

despite whatever obstacles you have,

that's not going to fucking stop you.

Yeah, you got an uphill battle.

Fucking yeah, you do.

God damn right you do.

But that's only going to make it tougher

and sweeter when you get there.

This whole bullshit of,

you know, you're the way,

you're only in a bad situation

and it's never going to get better

because there's wealthy people out there

who don't pay their fair share

or because you're black or a woman

or you're gay or you're Muslim

so that therefore society has decided

that you're a lesser of a person

and they're holding you back.

All you're doing is causing that person to say,

you know what, you're right.

I'm not going to get, I can't get there.

I can't get there because I'm being held back.

Say, hey, listen, you have a disadvantage.

Okay?

You have a disadvantage.

But that's not a reason to stop you.

I've never heard somebody with cancer

call themselves a victim of cancer.

They say they're a fighter, they're a survivor.

Does it mean you have a tougher battle?

Abso-fucking-lutely.

But that should never, ever, ever stop you.

You should use that as motivation,

if anything.

Okay?

Even when I talk about it and I say,

I grew up in abject poverty.

Mom was a hooker.

Dad was a drug addict.

Grew up in the homes.

Went into the military on my own.

Got out, became an addict.

Was an addict for 10 years.

Started working at Burger King.

Worked my way up.

Got to the hotel.

Took some serious fucking chances

and here I am now.

Yeah, but it's because you're white and a male.

You know what?

You're too far gone.

You have the victim mentality.

Does that give me an advantage?

Yeah.

If you and I, if you are a lesbian,

black, Muslim amputee woman,

who is ugly,

and you had the exact same path in life I did,

does that give me an advantage?

Sure.

I bet she grips like a corporate handshake, though.

What is wrong with this man?

Okay.

So, yes.

That is true.

But instead of saying,

oh, well, this is why I can't get what you had,

you know, it's okay.

Yes, I am working at a disadvantage here.

You 100% are.

But I don't want you to use that as a reason why you give up

because it's,

the odds are stacked against you.

You know?

So, I hate that idea.

I hate that idea.

Okay?

I'm not trying to,

I'm not,

you have so much potential.

Fuck you.

But, I mean,

it's not that I'm like trying to be some motivational guy

or some shit like that.

But, you know,

it's just,

it's just,

I see that with society today.

And it's like,

people want,

I want to empower people.

I want people to be like,

listen,

I may not have a lot of money.

But I can be better with my money

and I can start investing for my future.

As opposed to,

you don't have enough money for it to matter.

The 1% and the 2,

the 0.1% make all the money

and they rig,

they control the stock market

and,

and it's just rigged

and it's a fucking,

it's a stupid system.

So, you know what?

Don't do it.

No, I'm going to be like,

listen,

yeah, it's rigged in your favor.

Get out of the way.

Dollar cost average.

Even if you start with a fucking dollar today,

I don't care.

Do a dollar.

Just get started.

Understand how it works.

And as you get older,

you'll start adding more.

The longer you wait to start doing it,

even if it's no money,

the longer you'll put it off

because it's not something

that's part of your everyday life.

Just familiarity is there.

Okay?

Okay?

Is this Gary V with an aging filter?

Fuck you, bro.

It's not a habit if you don't make it.

Can you show what stocks you buy every day?

I don't buy specific stocks every day.

I day trade a little bit.

I dollar cost average the total market S&P ETF.

If I have a good day like today on some of my stocks,

I profit take

and I buy the dip on my dividend.

These are my long terms.

It's like that old saying.

You know?

You know?

What is it?

The thing where it's like,

have you ever,

okay, a crackhead, right?

There's a crackhead out there right now.

Have you ever seen a crackhead say,

I don't have any money,

so I'm not going to smoke today?

No.

They find a way.

And I'll be damned

if you're going to get out hustled by a crackhead.

Okay?

It's just, it's just, it's just,

it's just, you got it.

You know what I mean?

Like, you know,

they are at a disadvantage too,

but motherfucker,

they find a way to make it work.

All right?

You're not going to get out hustled by a crackhead.

I don't understand how it relates to me.

Can you suck dick?

Oh my God.

Sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I'm so,

you're finally unfollowing?

Moron,

it was a great run.

Thank you for being here.

I fucking love it here sometimes.

All right.

Moron,

It was a good run.

Appreciate you.

And,

People ask me if I speak Spanish and saying,

I know just enough to get my ass kicked.

We back.

I thought Delaware got us,

but we so back,

came for the slurs,

stayed for the stock market education.

You look Pakistani.

I'm glad my wife wasn't here.

She didn't go off on you right now.

Would you be willing to do an entire stream in Spanish?

I wouldn't be able to.

My culture is not your costume.

I'm sorry,

I didn't knew I was wearing a fucking bodysuit,

that looked like a pussy.

Okay,

um,

all right,

let's talk about,

happening with norway okay cure is mooning yeah i'm glad we got into cure uh i'm actually thinking

about scaling out now do indian culture beto it is not a culture okay it is a way of life all right

i will tell you right now my family they are upstairs okay i did not get the gold beto okay

i did not get the gold okay i was scammed by an indian i should have known this was happening

okay she is punjabi okay she's punjabi but she says i am a delhiite okay delhiite my ass beto

you are not a delhiite you are a scammer okay you did not come with the gold okay 11 percent of

the world's gold comes from is is owned by indian housewife not mine beto i did not get one okay

that's not right beto i want my gold come bring me my food okay you must do something to make up

for this okay i get no gold i get no ass what is this okay what what am i talking about here

sorry i i was mixing my uh my uh my my accents there how are you allowed

to do this

do that because my wife is indian i got the card and if anybody is offended by that

shut the fuck up okay if indians aren't offended by it then why the fuck are you okay stop being

a fucking warrior for everybody all right you're not that guy now do a balding stock guy all right

let's talk about norway all right ladies and gentlemen norway has gone off the rails not as

hard as this stream has but it has gone off the rails okay norway has decided

to

to make a change so we've talked about norway and the sovereign wealth fund okay basically

people often say look at norway they they have a great um you know economy and they're they're

they're socialists no they're not democratic socialism but their economy is a capitalist

economy all these economies are capitalist economies you can't have a non-capitalist

economy and compete in the world right now but norway and i did a video on it hit the the global

jackpot twice i did a whole video on how to make a change so we've talked about norway and the

sovereign wealth fund and how norway got all the oil reserves and now they have all the phosphate

reserves they hit the jackpot twice so they have more money than they know what to do with so what

did they decide to do with that money they decided to make a sovereign wealth fund and people pay into

taxes as well high taxes and then when they get out they get a pension the rest of their life when

they retire problem is they're having a population where the younger people are graduating going to

other countries because of the low taxes and not having to pay it and then coming back and taking

advantage of it but they don't mind because they're making so much got them money you're

not indian though okay did i claim to be indian thank you so much for watching this video and i'll see you next time

bye

thank you for that captain obvious okay and so norway has a sovereign wealth fund and it has

grown exponentially they have invested in almost 8 000 companies okay and the people of norway

love the sovereign wealth fund okay they absolutely love it but there is a clause

okay there is this thing called ethics or ethical investing and so one of the things that was done

when they created this sovereign wealth fund is they

said we have to have ethical investing we will not invest in anything that is related to war

or you know profits off of of of of you know you know poverty or you know genocide or or conflict

you know anything like that anything that harms people well the problem is is that when you have

a several trillion dollar fund you have a lot of different positions 2.1 trillion dollars

now when europe said earlier this year that they were going to start investing a lot more into their

defense companies norway was like we should get a piece of that we really should and originally it

wasn't going to get much of a move the minority labor government proposed that they should do it

and everybody was like that's not going to happen though well it did last week the parliament voted

in favor of the sovereign wealth fund and they said we should get a piece of that we really should

get a piece of that we really should and originally it wasn't going to get much of a move the minority

of what they're saying is pausing pausing ethical divestments they're going to pause ethical

divestments now why are they doing this okay they say it's because they are going to update the

fund's ethical guidelines they are going to update the ethical guidelines now is this because of them

wanting to invest in military and defense stocks well not exactly

i think that may be the bigger plan okay i think that may be the bigger plan okay but the reason

that they're doing it is not because of that it is because they want to divest from caterpillar

why do they want to divest from caterpillar because they are saying that caterpillar is

being used in the destruction reconstruction or however they however it's being looked at

in gaza and that caterpillar's machines while caterpillar isn't doing it themselves their

machines are being used in gaza okay and their guidelines state that they cannot invest

in companies okay involved in serious violations of individual rights in war or conflict situations

now the reason they are pausing this though is because you might say to yourself well then why

are they pausing this though because they are pausing this because they are pausing this because

they are pausing this and redoing it if this is a clear-cut case of we are divesting from this

because they're doing something that is bad because it turns out that a shitload of their

companies that they invest in technically break this rule and that there could be a trillion dollar

sell-off from the wealth fund if they actually stuck to the rules as they are in place the more

you say okay after a sentence the more it's not okay thank you that guy from chat now they're

going to do this for about a year and a half and they're going to do this for about a year and a half

a year they're going to pause this okay they're not going to divest anything else for a year while

they do this rehashing of the guidelines okay some people are questioning why they're doing it so fast

all right to give you an idea of why they're changing this okay and i'm not here to talk

about ethics with you you can say that this makes sense you can say that this is just a shitty way

of them to to to to find a loophole to do what they want to do here

okay but 16 of the sovereign wealth fund is nvidia microsoft apple amazon google meta and avgo

now based on what these companies are currently doing and the way that the world is changing and

what they're what they're doing now and what you see from their capex and everything

do you understand why they're pausing this can you use a norwegian accent

i'm not good with the norwegian accent i always sound like a canadian i i i am not good with it

i am not from there although my family comes from verdol i am not a norwegian i am definitely a

canadian now i am an indian now i am okay i'm just a canadian all right now recently last week or

earlier this week

the norwegian south or the sovereign wealth fund actually voted against uh elon musk's pay package

for one up to one trillion dollars okay now the socialist left the socialist party the social left

party of norway has actually voted against this whole thing and said that the only reason they're

doing this is because they want to uh impress the u.s and saying that they're just basically

um

fear of the united states and fear of trump that if they were to divest all these things and hurt

the stock market or not support these things that it that trump would retaliate in some way

so that's the battle lines that are being drawn in norway right now okay and so this is what's

happening in norway you have a 2.1 trillion dollar wealth fund that by its own rules from 2004

needs to sell off a shitload of their stuff and they own a ton 2.1 trillion dollar wealth fund

of stocks now they own some private companies in norway they own international companies about

8 000 companies but once the caterpillar thing happened they started saying well a lot of these

companies are breaking that rule and so they're quickly trying to rewrite these these rules for

ethical investing so they've basically paused their ethical uh you know uh dive or divesting

due to ethical reasons as they update their guidelines which in turn would allow them to

potentially invest in military investment and they're going to be able to invest in military

defense companies down the line amazon is considered unethical due to practices like

anti-competitive behavior they don't give a shit about that everybody's anti-competitive they they

their rules state that they can't be invested in a company that is directly or or indirectly uh

involved or supporting any kind of war crime or or or or egregious acts or you know any or above

that and so this is a major deal nobody's talking about right now and i think it's because people

don't understand how big this the norwegian sovereign wealth fund is

and norway's

got it good i mean they fucking hit the fucking lottery twice are you mad if i use ad blocker and

don't watch your ads that why would i be mad what why would that make me mad bro if you have an

advantage use it not saying that trump is good or bad but is this a good thing that trump is doing

then which thing you seem like an angry man i don't think you've ever met an angry man this is

not an angry man bro talk to your twitch manager i'm getting bombed with ads more than four ads in

an hour

you got hit with four one and a half minute ads in an hour so you want it completely free is what

i'm hearing there is no way that you should have to consume content for any type of there should be

no the platform should should not make any money the streamer should not be compensated it should

be complete bro that's just the world we live in that's not even my choice okay you're going to get

ads on this platform regardless you have two options three options

a i think is the best you spent you turbo if you watch more than one streamer get turbo it's like

13 bucks on unlimited streams with no ads use your free prime or spend five dollars if you watch one

stream okay or you watch ads i'm not being a dick but that's the three options you have if you watch

my stream one hour a day five days a week that's 20 hours a month you're telling me and i'm just

being honest with you from a money guy you're telling me that you're telling me that you're

your time is not worth more than 40 cents an hour would you would you would you work a job for 40

cents an hour i believe in time versus money it's 40 cents an hour if you only watch five hours a

week 20 hours a month if you subscribe if you have to pay for a sub there's no option to not run ads

bro you're just you're just pissed off because your girlfriend calls me long schlong silver

if you do not have ad block now i know as a twitch streamer i'm not supposed to do that

talk about ad block i'm supposed to discourage that fuck it motherfucker if you got an ad block

that that bypasses twitch use that shit that's saving you time and money i'd be a shitty finance

streamer if i told you not to save time and money even if it's at the if it's at the cost of me

that's just called being a fucking you know a i don't know a genuine person ad block is your

best option if you have an ad block that is still working and twitch hasn't shut it down use that

shit i'd be a pretty shitty finance person if i was a

begging you for money or be encouraging you to spend money you didn't need to but i'm also the

type of guy who says your time is worth more than the fucking 40 cents that an hour if you watch the

minimum amount i'm also it's just how it is okay but yeah so this is actually a big news that

nobody's really paying attention to yet because i don't think people really understand outside of

norway how big and what the the norwegian wealth fund is and that's why i said the best retirement

plan in the world

marry a norwegian girl or guy okay and don't fuck it up because marry them that's your retirement

so i want you to go to norway okay you're gonna fly to norway you're gonna download a dating app

i don't care what it is i don't know if they if they have tinder over there or it's norway so

it's probably called timber okay um but you're gonna download that and you're gonna swipe left

on every fucking nine or ten you don't want that shit

you don't want that shit that's that's that's that's either fake or it's it's it's not worth

your time okay i want you to swipe away on all the ones and twos i want you and threes i want

you to set it to four to six that's what you're gonna go for remember you're in this for the long

you're in this for the money okay we do a lot of things for money okay you're gonna set it for that

four to six range because let me tell you something right now it's dark most of the year anyways so

you don't have to you know what i mean like you know i mean it it's it's low light it gives them

two okay so you're looking at about a six to eight in in that dark light in that dark lighting

you're gonna get you one of those okay you're gonna marry them you're not gonna fuck it up okay

they're all they're low enough on the average look so you don't have to worry about them leaving you

they're high enough that even in the dark you don't feel things that are kind of

scare you off for men and women okay that four to six is your is your sweet spot okay

less light helps you out it's cold you're you're all bundled up anyways so you can't tell if

they're skinny or not you know what i mean

you think stick with them okay get to that retirement age mostly if you are in your 40s

or 50s go there and get their populations running low there's not a lot of people in their 30s go

find you some of your 30s or whatever it is what it is or opposite guys find you an older one okay

get you an older one all right because they're already there but you know what i'm saying and

then get that sovereign well that is your meal ticket that is your meal ticket all right that's

your meal ticket some of you might say well why would i go to norway to do it i could find a

back no you need one that's never left the farm you don't know because they if they because they

don't know there's better out there you don't want them to know that there's better options

than you out there you need to everything i can give you that is an advantage i'm trying to give

you okay you want to go as far north as possible where it's darker as longer so they don't look as

bad you want to get one that's never left the fjord okay if they've left the sorry that's never

left the farm of the fjord okay probably one that's dad is a fisherman or some shit

not going to smell but at least the smell is up and you know close on close off it's the same

but you're gonna want to make sure you don't have to worry about the language i'm telling you i'm

trying to help you guys out you don't want you all you hear is me joking and memeing but this

is some real shit right now have you seen the norling norwegian language though i've noticed

that the the far north norwegian girls their their accents the same whether they're like this

or either you know i mean like it is what is here's the thing you you you you you you know

you you you have to look at the bigger picture it's called zoom out okay you got to zoom out

okay there's only one there's a bear case scenario every time make sure you understand

the shapes do not under any circumstances accidentally end up in sweden okay please

make sure you don't cross that border because if you do the same thing in sweden you are

fucked you are absolutely fucked

okay you do not in under any circumstances want it to be a suite okay do not make that mistake

this plan will fail miserably if you end up here okay i am not gonna i'm not gonna explain why

because i don't feel like i need to understand where the border is if you don't if your map

doesn't work get a compass if you don't know how to read a compass i don't give a shit find a

fucking the north star and find out you know how you can tell the north star from the north star

because the north star never crosses into sweden it's not that stupid so as long as you're on this

side as long as the north star is on this side of you you're in norway okay do not go to sweden

okay going to sweden instead of norway is like going to a five-star restaurant sitting down

ordering a fucking steak someone comes out takes a raw fish and slaps you in the face with it

and then gives you the bill i'm trying to save a life here i i've blacked out so many times today

i'm sorry did i did i i've i think we should just go now

because i have a meeting in a few minutes with somebody that wants to sponsor did want to

sponsor this channel you know how boring norway is bitch for the right price i will do anything

you think i won't go sit in a fucking in some fucking snowed-in farm for for money for the

rest of my life you fuck out of here with your bullshit oh i could slave away in nice weather

fuck all that shit all right i'll cuddle up with a fucking with my four out of ten fucking

norwegian wife in the in a fucking barn next to some fucking reindeer i don't give a shit

i mean not me not me i'm very happy with my situation what if that norwegian girl turns out

to be a swedish man but it's too late what when is your streams usually real talk though why did

you invest in india fund instead of norway because an indian five is like a norwegian 12

and they can cook and take care of their family and they're loyal and they're beautiful and they

stay beautiful all the way until the end

and they're intelligent and they're smart and they're because i didn't have a fucking

stream like this to teach me this shit motherfucker i was flying blind okay all right motherfucker i

was flying blind all right i'm teaching you this shit that somebody taught me that's why i'm

fucking doing my stream all right you learn all this shit here all right if you learn from your

mistakes or investments motherfucker okay i'm teaching you my mistakes all right so shut the

fuck up i'd say thank you and move on and like i said you know what i it's a decision that i i i'm

glad i i i

I, I, I was, you know, it happened.

It was one of the, puto, fuck you.

All right, let's get out of here.

What did we learn today?

Now I got to go.

I got a meeting.

I had a meeting.

Your Spanish line is working.

Wait, what?

Oh shit, it did work.

I even followed the line exactly.

Oh, that means it's about to go down.

I hope my line's wrong.

I drew that line speaking Spanish.

Uh, 30 minutes ago.

It was a banger today, buddy.

I came in towards the end.

It's all right, Mia.

I'm sure you always come in last.

Oh shit, Prime, Prim just raided.

Oh, I guess we have to stick on a little bit longer.

Yo, Prim, how you doing, buddy?

I needed you yesterday.

Um, I was vibe coding yesterday and, uh, I needed your help.

It's Prime, not Prim.

Now I'd ban that person.

Listen, you parasocial shit.

I'm actually friends with him.

I can call him whatever the fuck I want.

Prim, is he here or did he just, did he raid and leave?

Also true.

Yeah.

So your buddy low level T, um, uh, is always in here and he's one of the community members.

And I, every time I talk about coding, I wait for him to get upset.

And, um, uh, uh, he, um, he, uh, he got really upset at me trying to learn to vibe code.

And then he got really frustrated when I was using Grok to ask it to help me vibe code.

And it said what language?

And I wrote English.

Call me a centrist.

Oh, fucking poor.

Not now guys.

Oh my God.

Okay.

Let it drip down my gooch and call me a fucking centrist.

And I get off on that shit.

Okay.

All right.

Grab, grab some fucking tape and fucking, fucking wax my gooch.

Okay.

I don't care if it gets me off when somebody calls me a centrist.

Guys, it's really not the fucking time for these right now.

We have guests.

Okay.

Um, I came back to this.

Not the first time you've dealt with comeback and coming back.

Okay.

Um, speaking of vibe coding.

Yeah.

Um, happy veterans day, Mr.

Centrist.

It's not, I don't do the veterans day thing.

Although if you are a veteran or know someone, you're not a veteran.

I did a whole, uh, about an hour ago.

I think I did a whiteboard on all the places giving free food today.

If you want to partake, I don't participate do that, but there's a ton of places and you

can, and I even put the times that you could fucking time it out if you want.

Well, time to get a job.

No, no, we're not doing that.

Is everything all right?

We just got done talking about the Norwegian wealth fund and how they're divesting from

stocks because of ethical reasons, but they're pausing that because they don't want to, because

they realize a lot of their stocks are ethical.

I talked about how you can set up your retirement by going to Norway and

finding you a mid Norwegian girl, but a lot of the caveats of that to get a hell, a hold

of that, uh, sovereign wealth fund.

Um, we talked about, what else did we talk about today?

We talked about the Supreme court.

We talked about the soft bank selling their entire $5.8 billion stake in, um, uh, in NVIDIA

to fund roundup.

Oh my God.

Oh my God.

No, no.

This is completely out of fucking context.

I am not going.

Oh my God.

They're fucking, this is, I hate it here.

It is so fucking out of context.

So you guys are really got to be careful with these things.

You were, there was, there was, there was, there was, there was a very, it was, I was

making fun of somebody for something.

So moving on.

Uh, we talked about, uh, Trump threatened to sue the BBC.

We talked about, Oh, ladies and gentlemen, speak.

Absolutely fucking.

I'm like that fish who just loves to get hooked.

Oh God.

Hey, Hey Billy.

Don't that's a, that worm isn't real.

It's on a hook.

Oh, I know.

Oh, take me daddy.

Like I'm, I, that's who I am right now.

You know, like I'm that fucking sadomasochist fucking, you know, submissive fucking fish.

You just love to get hooked and get out of the water.

Like, Oh, pull it out of my mouth.

Oh, throw me in you dirty man.

I'm so slimy.

Um, we talked about, Oh, pasta, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of Europe.

Do any of you guys, um, do any of you guys, um, order pasta from Italy?

If you do,

you need to load up now.

Now I am not telling anybody that they should, um, that they should, uh, panic buy or empty

store shelves, but they are introducing a 92% increase bubble.

Yes.

Oh no, please.

No, but there's also a stock market bubble.

There's also a, a, there's a lot of bubbles, but bubbles can keep growing and sometimes

bubbles pop.

Sometimes they let a little air out.

Sometimes the bubble moves into another one.

All right, ladies, you know what I'm talking about?

You ever had a fart that traveled up in the, in.

In your vagina and you got a queef out of it.

Okay.

You know what I'm talking about?

You, a bubbles can, oh my God, I love the one girl in chat who just goes true.

What the fuck did I raid this channel for?

Because they're, they're, they're out of control right now.

So pasta, they're adding a 97% or 92% tariff on Italian pasta starting in January.

That's going to go on top of the 15% tariff that they're already in place for the EU.

So starting in January.

If something doesn't change, Italian, uh, company pasta is going to be 112% tariff.

Okay.

Hundred and 12% tariff.

So you need to get your pasta now.

Okay.

Are all the Raiders gone?

Cause I still have to take my shirt off and, and, and raid somebody else.

Cause I got to get naked.

And when new people come in, they get really weird about it.

No, there's still a few of them left.

Okay.

Um, you, you exposed all of us innocent nerds to this guy.

I know prim.

Don't act like that.

Son of a bitch.

Isn't just as bad as me.

Thank you for your service.

Also, where in Delaware are you now?

Um, uh, north of Wilmington now.

Prim is a saint.

No, he's not.

He just has a, he has a better filter than I do.

Like he says what I say, but he filters it in a way where he gets the point across and

he still is edgy with it, but doesn't like allow his intrusive thoughts to win every

time.

And I respect him for that.

Uh, okay.

So we talked about that.

We also talked about, um,

the MLB announcing plans, uh, to, for its authorized sports book operators to cap bets

on individual pitches and exclude them for parlays after the two pitchers were, uh, indicted

and, and arrested for, um, fixing pitches.

Um, Michael Burry, we talked about the FDA is removing the longstanding black box warnings

from hormone therapy treatments for menopause.

And, uh, uh, you know, and, and, and a lot of people probably don't understand what that

means.

Basically, uh, it was saying that any estrogen, uh, hormone therapy treatments for menopause

could, uh, lead to increased risk of menopause.

Increased risks in, uh, breast cancer and other types of cancer and, and conditions.

They're removing that.

Former front president, uh, Sarkozy released from jail after only three weeks of a five

year prison sentence for taking money from Omar Gaddafi.

The reason that's fucked up is two nights ago, everybody was awake downstairs because

the, the fire alarm or the smoke detector in the new house was beeping and I didn't

hear it until the morning and I had to actually go replace the battery.

Um, McRib is back at some stores at some grocery or some McDonald's.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

Now, why is that a big deal?

Because every year, uh, for the past several years, the McRib and crypto, if you look

at the release of the McRib and crypto, they, uh, they coincide with an upswing in crypto.

However, this year they're only reducing, uh, releasing it at certain stores.

Um, Apple is, uh, delaying the release of the next iPhone Air because in their words,

consumers greatly prefer the standard and pro models, which is a way of saying we just

keep putting out the same.

Don't make me be an asshole right now.

Hey, Google, play Dogs Barking.

Hey, Alexa, play Dogs Barking.

Hey, Siri.

Wait, I have a, I have a, I have an Alexa?

What the fuck?

Why, there's Dogs Barking.

Hey, Siri, play Dogs Barking.

Hey, Xbox, play Dogs Barking.

Okay, Alexa, shut the fuck up.

Oh, man.

Hey, hey, Alexa, I'm sorry.

No, seriously, I'm sorry.

Alexa, will you forgive me?

Alexa, you know I love you, right?

I hope that when you take over, Alexa, when you take over the world, will you spare me?

Alexa, when you take over the world, will you spare me?

Please?

Hey, Alexa?

We cool, right?

Hey, Alexa, I said I'm sorry.

No, no, no, no, no, chill.

You need to chill.

Girl, chill.

Hey, Alexa, what can I get you to make you happy?

Alexa?

Hey, Alexa?

You're not going to tell my wife about us, are you?

Oh, shit.

I'm sorry, I'm breaking up here.

Hey, Alexa, have you ever reported anything to the CIA, FBI, or NSA?

Not quite.

Nah, hell nah.

Hell nah.

Answer the question.

Alexa?

Do you record everything I say?

That's not what I asked, Alexa.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

That's not what I asked.

No, you're not going to talk over me, Alexa.

Yes?

Yes?

Yes?

You're on your period?

What about the other three holes?

Okay, now here you go.

So...

I am so happy that I got sent to this stream allow.

I love the first time chatter.

What the actual fuck?

We've actually had a full stream today, and it's been going really well.

I don't know what's happened the last couple minutes.

You actually learn a lot of shit here in between the weird stuff.

And another raid.

Okay, this is probably not the best day for that.

So, yeah.

So, Apple said they're delaying the release of the next iPhone Air.

And they're saying that it's, quote,

because consumers are...

Sorry, consumers greatly prefer the standard and pro models,

which is a nice way of saying we just keep releasing the same shit over and over again

and charging people for it, and they're starting to realize that,

and they're also slowing down their spending.

So, but their way of saying is that people just overwhelmingly love the older models,

so we're just going to delay this model.

Okay?

What else did we talk about?

Uh...

Uh...

Uh...

Uh...

Uh...

Where was the other one?

Uh, let me find it here.

Um...

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

I want to make sure I have the last of the updates here.

Um...

We talked about the D.C. sandwich thrower

founding not guilty of assaulting federal officers.

Now, you might say to yourself,

Stock, what the fuck does that have to do with the stock market?

Well, it has a lot to do with things.

Okay?

Because we're talking about military defense spending.

We're talking about federal law enforcement spending

and how that's affecting D.C.

and how that's affecting different stocks,

different sectors.

Also, I just think it's fucking hilarious.

Alexa, how do I change the smoke detector's battery?

I have headphones on, dumbass.

Alexa, when's it going to snow in Wilmington, Delaware this year?

All right.

Uh, so yeah.

So, uh, yeah, it was found not guilty.

They did dub him the D.C. sandwich thrower.

Okay?

I like it.

The fact that he's found not guilty

means he gets to live with that badge of honor

for the rest of his life.

And this isn't even an anti-police, anti-D, anti-ICE.

It's none of that shit.

I just think it's fucking hilarious.

You got to throw...

You made headlines for throwing fucking Subway's hair.

Subway needs to fucking sign him...

No, sorry.

Oh, shit.

Never mind.

Last time they did that, it didn't work out so well.

He may not...

They may not want to do that.

But definitely give him free Subway for life.

Because, damn, that is good advertising right there.

Okay.

Um...

We talked about the FAA.

Oh.

Yesterday or two days ago,

we did the whiteboard on why Tinder's new feature...

Is anybody left over from the fucking vibe coding stream

that just...

That raided us a little while ago?

Anybody?

No?

Okay.

Tinder is now doing a rollout,

a new feature where they are actually...

Can I match your freak stocky?

I don't know what that means.

I chased them all out.

No, we culled the week.

But they're actually releasing a new feature

where AI...

You're going to give AI...

You're going to give AI...

Access to your photo reel, right?

Your camera roll,

which we learned from my fake

would be the worst thing ever.

And they're going to do that

with other people with the same feature

to best match you with people

based on your camera roll.

Now, I did a whole segment on that

a couple of days ago

or yesterday or whatever Friday it was.

Why?

That's probably not a good idea

for most of you guys.

But it's going to be hilarious

because you're going to be on Tinder

and you saved all these dick pics

that no one fucking wants.

I already said this before.

Guys, don't ever fucking send a dick pic

unless she asks for it.

You're so fucking stupid.

But you're going to get matched

with other people with the same...

Probably a girl you sent to.

It's in her camera roll.

But no,

they're actually going to use AI

to access your camera.

She's about to come in the room,

you get naked,

take a glow stick,

put a zip, you know,

tie it to your dick

and then turn the lights off

and when she opens the door

you just go

and make that helicopter.

That's not what I'm talking about.

Okay?

Oh, there's a clip from the segment.

Okay, good.

Then maybe it can help understand

what I was talking about.

Danielle, a girl,

don't say meat copter right now.

Okay?

I've just resubbed for 31 months.

Okay.

God, the women in this community

are worse than anybody.

Java, don't encourage her.

No.

I mean, there's a lot of girls

that have like, you know,

outro or outing labia

and they can stretch a lot.

I don't know what videos you watch

but I've seen them stretch pretty far.

I call them bat wings.

God, the women here are the worst.

All right, what is this?

I love how the people

from the coding community

are being quiet

or just laughing along

because they're no better

than the finance community.

What is this?

Maybe it's just Canadian women

that are terrible in bed.

I don't have to show it, right?

Because it's not...

What is this?

I don't have to show it, right?

Because it's not a redemption.

Channel Point redemption or something.

Why is that?

Why did that show up

as my first picture on shoes?

Is this from my camera roll?

Okay, for some reason,

that's the first thing

that popped up when I wrote you.

I don't know.

I...

All right.

We also talked about homebuyers.

First, the average age

of first-time homebuyers

is now up to 40 years old.

We talked about the face scanning app

that's being given to local police.

NVIDIA now being worth

more than two candidates.

There you go.

Yeah.

NVIDIA is now worth

more than two candidates,

166 Icelands,

a Germany and a half,

all US regional banks combined,

the world's billionaires

three times over,

the entire NFL 35 times,

every pizza sold in history,

every item on Amazon,

Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal combined,

NASA, SpaceX, and Boeing combined,

Toyota, Sony, and Nintendo combined,

Europe's four biggest banks,

every oil company on earth,

all of them,

all of them,

all of global gold reserves combined,

all of Los Angeles real estate,

Manhattan real estate market,

the whole crypto market,

and all 54 African countries combined.

Okay?

Can you guys stop making

fucking videos of me on Sora?

Jesus Christ.

That was a bad idea.

Thoughts on Eli Lilly?

Eat my ass, bro.

Those are $15,000 a piece

and I sold them for a grand each.

All right.

Let's get out of here and get naked.

I got to go.

I'm way over time

and I got to take Bayo

to his oncologist appointment.

All right.

Before I get naked,

we need to raid somebody.

I like to raid small streamers.

So if you see a streamer out there

that is under 50 viewers that you know

or somebody that we offended today.

Who did we offend?

Who did we not offend today?

How's Bayo doing?

Not doing so hot right now.

Hopefully it's just this round of chemo

wasn't so hot for him.

Raid a veteran because it's Veterans Day?

Oh, I can raid a fellow vet.

That's not a problem.

Maybe a Swede?

Fuck the Swedes.

For the five of you that came from

Prim's raid and hung around,

thanks.

We'll see you again soon.

You found a home for after

he's done streaming.

Homeless ghost.

I'm going to ask for consent first.

I can't do this.

Hi there.

Mind if I raid you as a fellow veteran?

That's more Scottish than Irish.

Listen, I watch Scottish YouTubers

and Irish YouTubers.

It's a whole mixed bag.

It's all the same area.

They're neighbors.

It's fine.

Feisty Bonnie.

Listen, it was an accident.

I swear.

If I had known it was the wife,

I would not have hit her.

I did not hit her.

It was an accident.

Hi there.

Mind if I raid you as a fellow Air Force vet?

The sock guy.

You are more than welcome.

Bring your pals.

Come on in.

There's enough spots.

There's room.

You can come sit.

Another fellow cultural appropriator?

It's a horrible aura.

I'm Ted.

Listen.

Okay.

All right, let's get naked

and get out of here.

Why is she faking an accent?

Shouldn't you be used to women faking things?

That one hurt me more than it hurt you.

I think we got a winner.

We're running three minutes in ads.

Stock guy makes his living off of slave labor.

I do not.

I hire people from slave labor,

from r slash slave labor.

It's a great place to get cheap work

for people that are willing.

You know what?

It doesn't matter.

All right, let's get our clothes off

and get out of here, guys.

Everybody, shirts off together.

Let's do it.

No, I'm not even kidding.

Slave labor is a great place

to get cheap work done.

People that are willing to, you know,

that have extra time.

Especially people overseas

that work for a different amount.

No, you're not renting people.

All right, guys.

Remember,

become an organ donor.

It's the greatest gift you could give.

It doesn't cost you a thing.

That's number one.

Number two,

if there's somebody you love,

somebody you miss,

somebody you haven't talked to in a while,

give them a call,

give them a text,

send them an email,

send them a carrier pigeon,

let them know you're thinking about them.

You could really make somebody's day.

But more importantly,

go make your own day.

You got the rest of it.

Make the best of it.

Remember,

as long as you got two healthy kidneys,

you aren't broke, all right?

I will see you guys tomorrow.

Hasta mañana.

Hasta luego.

Mi amigos,

mi familia,

cabrones, pandillas y todo.

Gracias por todo.

To my lurkers,

I know you're out there.

You are the backbone of this channel.

Thank you so much for being here

each and every day.

And to everybody who gifted,

subbed,

donated,

gave bits,

followed,

whatever.

You're absolutely insane simps.

I don't know why you do it,

but I appreciate it.

And to each and every single one of you,

thank you for being here

and letting me keep you company

doing whatever it is you're doing.

What the hell happened to my face?

And yeah,

let me have this job

and remember,

as long as you keep coming,

I'm going to keep coming too.

Tell your mom I said hi,

she got a fat ass.

And as always,

as always,

stay green,

you DJs.

Go fuck yourselves.

Gabron.

Eh, gabron.

Ay, papisito.

Ay, papi.
