All right, good morning, you DJs.

It's that time again.

It's that time again.

That's right.

We're back.

We're back.

Hope you bought the dip on Friday.

All right, let's run it.

Let's go.

Let's go.

We got stuff to do today.

We got stuff to do today.

Not too late.

Pepper spray 1,991 just for sub for 43 months.

Get your shit together.

Pay down your debt.

Consolidate it.

I would personally like to see you not make stupid financial decisions, not overspend.

Put your money investing.

Allow it to grow so you can take a nice little key, unlock that chain, say F you, Karen.

Go home to your paid off house with your emergency fund and your retirement investing.

If you learn from your mistakes, they're investments.

They're investments.

All right.

Don't forget, you buy the dips, you sell the rips.

I learned from beyond today.

Dude, I started way too early on that, but I still got out with 12%.

Is Wednesday going to be your last regular stream?

Yeah, because I'm leaving.

Thanks for TVRD made rent.

That was wild.

I'm still in some of it.

Buy more GPUS.

Got it.

Oh, God.

I actually bought some at 46 cents this morning, but that shit's going to go bankrupt soon,

so be careful.

I'm running JZXN again.

I'm hoping for another pop.

Oh, shit.

I'm late.

Oh, God.

Last time you were late, you pumped out a kid.

I'm showing up for eight just resubbed for six months.

Happy six months.

Six months?

Are you only talking to Rokan on the topics of your title?

I mean, among others.

I bought Klarna and fell asleep drunk, and now I'm a community member.

Okay.

Like, I don't even know what to say to that.

Welcome, brother.

I mean, those are the main topics.

We're going to touch on other stuff.

Plus, I'm going to go into the questions you guys have.

W underscore DL.

Just resubbed for 53 months.

Stokki is the guy who orders a cheeseburger without cheese because he thinks it's a clever

way to order a hamburger.

What?

Congratulations to Salad Tosser for the W.

All right, StubHub.

Take me to the promised land today.

I'm in StubHub TVRD.

I'll play Beyond Meat if it goes under 80 cents again, and I'm looking at IONQ after

open.

All right.

Ding, ding, ding, ding.

All right.

So, let's keep an eye on Stub.

We're playing this as a main play.

Oh, I'm playing this as my main play today.

All right.

NVX popped 70% pre-market, but calm down.

Yeah, it hit over $5.

All right.

We're running.

NVX starting to move.

Let's see.

20%.

Let's go.

All right.

We got to put some stop losses in.

All right.

TVRD, we're still up 14% on that, so let's go ahead and put a stop loss of 7% on that

one.

Don't ask why we're playing this.

Even I don't know.

We'll keep an eye on IONQ.

The rest of our Beyond Meat.

We still got a few left at...

10% up, so we're going to go ahead and put our stop loss in.

All right.

8% turning stop loss there.

TVRD is moving.

All right.

We got us some movers.

All right.

So, we've got UUU up 20%, ladies and gentlemen.

We are now officially up 360% on UUU.

That is absolutely wild.

NVX, we're now up 100% this run.

Plug up 10%.

JZXN moving as well.

We're going to go ahead and put a stop loss on those.

And there goes IONQ.

We're going to keep an eye on IONQ.

We're going to keep an eye on IONQ.

Everybody loves to buy this dip and sell this rip whenever we get a move.

So, we're going to go ahead and keep a close eye on this one today.

Hopefully, AMAT can take us to the promised lands today.

All right.

We got stop losses set.

AMAT, yeah.

We went pretty heavy in AMAT.

Okay.

Biggest movers right now.

Okay.

So, we've got Divvy's down right now, but we got Google up 2%.

We got SoFi up 4%.

We got NNE 9%.

We got Gilt up 5%.

TSSI up 7%.

NBX 16%.

WeRide 6%.

Plug 9%.

Joby 4%.

Evgo 5%.

TVRD, we're killing it right now.

We are up 20% on that.

Rivian's up.

Stubb, that's my main play today.

We got Ford.

Poet is even green.

Well, no.

Cancel, cancel, cancel.

Jesus, don't do that to me.

I got this.

I tried contacting Schwab.

They said they don't see anything on their end about why 5%.

They said it could just be...

an update issue.

I'm like, but I don't need to update it.

All right.

So, let's go ahead and look at some of the stuff that we have.

So, AMET.

Pushing pretty nice.

There goes IONQ.

Remember, we're watching this because of the announcement this morning.

All right.

So, we've got some movers this morning.

We got our Joby calls that we took starting to move as well.

TVRD looking really nice here.

I don't really know.

Beyond Meat, we're still pushing on this one.

We kind of went heavy on Friday on the dips.

And hoping StubHub gets another move.

Lots of initiation upgrades this morning.

All right.

IONQ.

We're pushing now.

Yo, Zero Narrative.

Gifting 10 subs, dude.

Thank you so much.

Gifting to Grower, Chuck McNorris, J-Bow, Silent Wolf, Chris, GoBlueFoot, Mkins, Mr. Frolin,

X-Mart, and Missy Poops.

Yes, she does.

All right.

Yeah.

IONQ, obviously, big news this morning.

Beyond.

Absolute fucking...

Devastation.

I didn't take calls that opened.

There's no way on hell I was going to do that again.

You blame me for what happened Friday?

Some guy on Twitter actually said,

Just pump out some more Indian kids and take off whenever the market is red, you fake fuck.

And then blocked me.

I was like, you realize if I ever take off and the market is red, it's after I took off.

Like, I don't...

I've never seen the market red and been like,

All right, I'm quitting stream.

I just hate when they block me so I can't even like say something funny back.

I like to at least have something to clap back with.

Look at this.

This is the two things I got on, um, on Friday.

Look at this.

Keep popping out more Indian children and not show up to stream when the markets tank.

Such an easy job you have.

I said, you okay?

Go get another coffee sponsor while you have heart problems, you fake fuck.

And then blocked me.

I was like, damn.

Underscored.

At least with...

This guy, he goes, trash influencer.

So I liked it.

And I said, who the fuck do I influence?

Like, at least give me a chance to say something.

All right.

Beyond still moving.

Waiting for stub to get a second run here.

IONQ pull back here.

Probably going to bounce again.

We're going to see.

There should be some cooling off right now.

Just like with you guys.

I know you guys are being smart and you're, uh, you're, uh, you bought the dip and you're selling the rip.

Right?

Because you're being responsible.

Right?

Right?

Because you guys are responsible, right?

Right?

Why would somebody text me and ask me my Facebook code?

Oh, by the way, I finally got the ability to apply for the Instagram thing.

And they denied me.

I'm just, I'm just taking L's everywhere.

Let me go ahead and update my L here.

Uh, yeah.

I may have went a little bit, uh, uh, big on the, uh, on the margin.

Okay.

So here's what I'm going to do.

I am going to, um, hop into some IONQ shares.

I know it's crazy to do when they're already up 5%.

But I never said I was smart.

I am not a smart man.

All right.

We're having a really good morning.

Uh, we got AMD back over 220.

We got NNE at 49.

What's up, buddy?

Hey Stockerman, what do you deal with if I just held my stocks instead of selling for a quick buck?

Sold or closed for 200%, sold Q's for 150% and others that went thousands of percent, which I just sold early frown.

So my question is, is you must be pretty new to the market.

I'm assuming you didn't.

You can go through 2022 or 2018 and I'll tell you why every single time I start thinking, man, if I just would have held longer or held more, I would have made so much money and then you know what happens.

I remember when I did that and got absolutely destroyed because let me tell you something right now, it is much easier to get over missing out on profits on the way up than it is to hold too long and blow up your entire fucking account.

Okay.

You know, I mean, it's like, it's like winning.

It's like going to the playoffs in a sport and winning every game by one point.

Doesn't really fucking matter as long as you're winning.

Okay.

Well, shit.

Let's throw a Hail Mary to run up the score.

Hail Mary turns into a pick six.

You lose the game.

Run the ball, run the clock out at the end of the game.

Okay.

I'm telling you right now, these are, listen, I'm telling you right now, this is a long game.

This is not a short game.

You are thinking short term.

And here's what's going to happen.

If you do hang on to it.

And it doesn't.

It doesn't.

It doesn't.

If it does go really big, you're going to think you have it figured out.

And then it's over.

How many people do you think here went through 2018, 2020, 2022 thinking, oh, I've got it figured out.

I'll just keep running it and running it and carrying it and rolling it and rolling it.

Gone.

You're going to have that happen to you several times until you realize, fuck it.

There's another day tomorrow.

There's another trade tomorrow.

There's another hundred trades tomorrow.

And the day after and the day after and the day after for 20 fucking years.

Don't try to fucking do it now.

Because even if you do hit it out of the park and it runs it up, you're not going to quit.

You're not going to quit.

You don't even have to be a fucking gambling addict.

It's not even that.

You're not going to quit because you think, shit, I figured it out.

And now I'm going to turn 10,000 to 100,000 to a million to 10 million.

And then it goes to zero.

It happens to everyone.

Anyone who tells you that hasn't happened to them or isn't going to happen to them is full of shit.

That's just how it goes.

It took me getting punched in the face a lot of times.

It took my wife finding out about me blowing up an account one time.

But, okay, it is what it is.

You finally just learned.

I even looked at my wife the other day and I said, babe, if I would have held my Marvel calls for two more weeks, I'd have made 1,000%.

If I would have held my UNH and my SNPS and my whatever, I'd have been like that.

And she looked at me and she goes, yeah, but what if you held them too long?

You see?

I've been there.

We've all been there.

Just don't worry.

Just drown out the noise, man.

You know what it is?

It's looking at everybody else, posting their shit and talking.

Talking about their shit and it gives you FOMO.

Drown out the noise.

It's kind of like in life, right?

If you pay attention to everybody around you and all the nice things they have and how they're living these lives and going out and whatever like that, you're going to be like, man, why am I not doing that?

I should be doing that.

Fuck it.

I should go do that.

They look happy.

All the while, they're either in debt up to their ass or they're just posting their fucking highlight reels online and you don't see the real sadness and debt and crunch and fucking depression and anxiety they're dealing with behind the scenes.

It is what it is.

My wife and myself, our family, we live very.

Just normal, modest lives.

Everyone around us, you know, is like living this high life or whatever like that.

But I know how that shit goes.

I know how that shit goes.

They're putting on, you know, focus on you and what your path is and what your goals are and focus on that.

Okay.

Comparison is the theft of joy.

It really is.

I swear to God.

It takes you until hopefully you don't go bankrupt before you figure it out.

But comparison is the theft of joy and happiness.

You still on your clarna calls?

Yeah, I have one left.

I'm not trying to get all motivational this morning.

I'm just saying these are these are things that you got to think about.

If you don't, you're going to you're going to end up screwing yourself over.

But a Porsche get hot bitches.

No, it doesn't.

I'm going to be real with you.

All the money you spent on a Porsche to try to get hot chicks who probably won't even bang you anyways to get their attention.

You could have saved 90% of that money and invest it.

Take another 10% and actually paid somebody money that's hotter than them to actually close the deal with you and then leave.

And you'd still have 90% more.

Why would you spend all that money on the chance?

Maybe some superficial person hooks tries to hook up with you.

You're going to spend even more money on that.

It's you got it.

You're thinking the law.

You're thinking it the wrong way.

How's the move to Delaware going?

It's getting close.

It's getting close, man.

It's getting really close.

Really close.

All right.

We got we got a lot of shit really popping this morning.

All right.

We got to stop that on something.

Okay.

We got to stop that on.

AZXN.

I want to run TBH for fun.

By the way, guys.

TSSI for those of you guys about to dip with me on Friday.

Nice bounce back here.

Okay.

Evgo.

Holy shit.

I should have took those calls instead of the Joby ones.

All right.

NNE 7%.

We got SoFi 3%.

O is up.

We got TSSI flying right now.

NVX is our big winner today.

16%.

It hit $5 this morning.

So we talked about it this morning.

I could have a second run.

Plug.

19% going for $4 again.

UUUU 12%.

We are now up 330% on that.

TSSI big day.

NNE.

We ride 5% this morning.

Gilt 5%.

Stub hoping for another push today.

Celsius 4% today.

GRR 19.

So we got 3.5% there.

We got SoFi up 3.5%.

Joby 3.5%.

CLYM.

One of the Topher Yolos I'm in.

We're waiting.

I'm waiting for that to move a little bit.

Hasn't moved yet.

Just resubbed for 11 months.

MLGO back up a bit here.

Oscar over 19 again.

ATAI I got into this morning as well.

A little bit of it.

Not really moving too much right now.

We've got EBS back up and then a few others moving as well.

Pachiso, Ulix and Justres subbed for 19 months.

We're actually up 30% on Beyond Meat.

I said I was going to take calls out the gate this morning and I didn't.

And that kind of sucks.

But 30% up on the shares.

This one actually hurt a little bit because I was really worried that it wasn't going

to work out for me because I started buying at a dollar and I had to keep buying all the

way down to like 71 cents.

But now it's doing pretty good.

All right.

Good pickup on IONQ a few minutes ago.

Whoops.

I'm not updating right now.

Are you actually interviewing today?

Yeah.

We actually texted a lot last night.

I think we fucking nailed the bottom on that.

Almost the bottom.

Our entry is 73.27.

When to sell Beyond Meat?

I'm running an 8% trailing stop loss on it right now and just letting it go.

Did you tell him to sleep tight and sweet dreams?

No, no, no.

It's just we were texting last night because his PR lady had set up the thing and we just

double checked, you know, just ran through what we were going to talk about.

And that was it.

Why IONQ?

Oh, so we talked this morning in the call about the news that came out.

So in this market right now, retail.

It sells.

The first thing to sell they do is quantum computing and then AI.

And then the first thing that gets bought up is the same thing.

So we saw the sell off on Friday and then IONQ announced this morning that they actually

achieved a breakthrough for their quantum chemistry.

And it says it's showing its system can calculate atomic level, atomic level forces more accurately

than classical methods.

You know, obviously it's an early stage announcement for something longer, but that's going to

give people a little bit more time to think about it.

I'm not going to.

That's going to give people that want to buy that dip why they put it on IONQ as opposed

to potentially the other ones.

And that's why we're focusing on that one today.

It's FOMO stocky.

Thanks.

That's why I am thankful.

So FOMO stock is one thing for BYND this morning.

Are we holding IONQ forever?

I don't have a problem if you guys are if you guys are big on on on AI.

I mean, obviously, you know, I'm a big believer that if I don't understand something or it's

it feels like we're pricing something in too soon.

I like to trade it.

I don't want to really invest in it.

Again, that's just me personally.

You know, if you guys are more familiar with something, then, you know, obviously you you

want to invest in it, you know, long term, you know, and you pick individual companies.

But, you know, I I'm just more cautious than than than I probably was when I was younger.

Can I conflate my invasion points to U.S. dollars?

No.

What you invest in?

What do you mean what I invest in?

Are you like an Amazon for the week?

Man.

I'm still on Joby calls.

Yeah, I took those on last week.

Man, I'll be honest with you.

Amazon is not, you know, their retail side is struggling.

But I think that Amazon is a buy in this market, not just because of them falling behind everyone

else.

But I think their AWS backlog is not getting a lot of attention right now.

And I think that that's something that people are going to are sleeping on.

And so you've been doing this for years.

Come on, old man.

Dude, my eyes are on you, man.

You know, I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I am in a difficult situation right now.

And I think that that's something that people are going to are sleeping on.

And so, you've been doing this for years.

Come on, old man.

Do my portfolio is literally here every day.

My my long term investing in my swing trading portfolio is here.

Did I short the crypto market on Friday?

No.

But you know, Blue Throat, I'll be honest with you.

type of person who will be upset that you never get anybody to to talk and then complain and make

hard you know say things like that and then wonder why nobody wants to fucking come on the stream

so i'm glad you don't represent this community cloud we're gonna eat aws up and spit it out

okay then then then invest in cloud fair bro we're talking he asked me about a buy right now as far

as like a swing trade like he didn't tell me to invest for the rest of the fucking his life you

think amazon's gonna finally sell twitch no because because it's a money hack for it for them

it's a money hack for them remember twitch pays amazon for the streaming capabilities right they

pay them for the cloud right and then they lose money and amazon gets to write that down right so

basically they own a company who rents from them or or pays them and because of that they operate

a loss and because they own them

them they get to then write that down as a loss you see what i mean and so it's it's it's a money

hack for them holy beyond is cooked the amount of shares issued is insane oh yeah for sure that's

why we're only trading it we're just playing the the um the the retail bounce mnts not a money hack

oh i sold someone it popped at 152 this morning how's it looking right now jesus we got back

everything that we lost okay i'm gonna run it i'm gonna run tdic i saw this this morning i don't

even know what they are but i'm running them um oh mnts did fall a little bit okay i'll take what

i sold at 152 and buy here at 131 no but it's not only it's not only about um the the the write down

and whatnot you have to understand something live streaming is the future okay whether you like it

or not live streaming is the future and twitch owns that space it just does um you know it does

i mean yeah youtube gaming was doing pretty good but then even youtube gave

up on that even youtube was like all right you know what we're we're just gonna we're just

gonna give up on this and um you know facebook gaming disappeared um uh you know there's very

few out there that are compatible or comparable in any way so if you think about who owns the

kick kick is you have to understand something kick is while they've gained some because they're

basically all of the other companies okay so here's how you go okay let me let me put it to

you this way okay people are going to be like oh stokey doesn't understand

understand. No, I do understand. I do understand profitable or profitability and sustainability.

So they don't need to make money. I mean, even Twitch doesn't make money, but at least Twitch

has a way of making money and they have Amazon over them that they can file through. I know

people are going to say, well, stake. Yeah, but even them are only going to pay for so long as

long as they're not, as long as they're getting an ROI. If they're not, they're gonna have to

find out another way. So here you go. All right. So here you go. So here's an example. Okay.

In the last, let's just do the last 30 days, you know, even the last 30 days, because I feel like,

I feel like giving it long-term. I mean, I could do long-term if it helps people,

but let's just look at the last 30 days. Okay. So share of live streaming market.

Okay. So over the last 30 days, okay. Hours watched, right? Hours watched. You have,

hold on. Let's just do this actually. Cause let me see. Does it have anything,

but I don't want to.

I want to do longer than 30 days, but I don't think I even have an option here.

Let me see if I have a better one. Unc doesn't understand streaming.

If that's what you think. Sure. Okay. Here we go. I'm trying to get something that's

up to date out here. Not today. No, not today. Nope. I don't need you. Trust me. I'll handle

everything. What? Stick to politics, little bro. Don't you dare. I'm looking for the,

the, the latest numbers here because it keeps giving me, um, streaming like, uh, Disney and

stuff like that. I don't want, uh, that kind of live stream. I want firm head. He's typing in

chat GPT. No, I didn't even go to the GPT. I'm actually looking at global live stream markets

from, um, uh, from, uh, statistic, uh, all right, regardless, let's just, I'll just pull it up what

I got right here because this is, uh, this is the closest right now. So here you go. I'll just pull

up stream charts because they kind of keep it up to date. So over the last 30 days, okay. Over the

last 30 days, when you look at size of the, of the, of the platform and, and the amount on it,

so here you go. Um, globally. Okay. A YouTube over the last 30 days. Okay. Um, hours watched.

Okay. YouTube is at 3.96 billion. Okay. Twitch 1.33 billion. Okay. Now kick is at 508 million.

All right. These are the top three. Okay. These are the top,

and hours watched. Okay. But when you look at hours watched, you try to look at the amount of

people on that platform versus the amount of hours watched. So while YouTube looks like they're big

because they're almost three times as much, YouTube has 4 billion users. Twitch is like

50 million. So when you look at it from a percentage side wise, this is a much more

impressive amount, right? Not only that YouTube stopped spending money. They were, they were

putting a lot of money into it. They were putting a lot of money into it. They were putting a lot

of money into YouTube gaming. You saw all the creators that got paid all those paychecks. They

just stopped doing that. Okay. They just, they just, they just stopped doing it. Why did they

stop doing it? Because they realized that they're trying to pull from their, from their video

viewers to, to be live viewers. And while they're, the future is live streaming, they were,

there was no ROI. They weren't seeing enough growth post COVID to, to justify the amount of

money they were spending when they could spend that on other things. So they were trying to

like the NFL deal and new incentive package, creator packages. And what, what they're doing

now is, and I'm invested in Google. Another thing that they're doing now is, is they're trying to

bring a marketplace, just like TikTok has a marketplace. They're trying to go all in for

that because there's a lot of money in that, right? Twitch is just live streaming, right?

Twitch is trying to expand into live events. And I think the future for Twitch is going to be live

events as well. Kik, while Kik is picking up a lot of space here, a lot of that is also because

they allow some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some,

some content that is not really advertiser friendly. So when you look at something as far

as a long-term sustainability, right? You look at investors, right? How is this going to continue

to operate? Because right now they allow content that means they can't have ads. So there's no,

there's no revenue coming in there and they give 95% of subs to streamers, right?

And now that's great because remember that's that growth at all costs phase. You're willing to lose

money in order to acquire a user base, right? You,

you are willing to spend money and lose money in order to, to, to build your,

your, your, your brand and, and, and take market share away.

But the problem is, is then comes the growth at all costs in order for them to be sustainable,

either a stake has to, has to, you know, be able to make money from this somehow.

Now, some people will say, well, it's a direct pipeline to stake for gambling. Others will say

stake is just funding this because they want this to be a competitor to Twitch for a live streaming.

And, and, and the casino part,

it has nothing to do with it. However you look at it, here's the thing.

The reason that kick is, is, is, is as popular as it is because of these two things.

Streamers are there because they make more money per sub and viewers are there because number one,

TOS, right? TOS is much different and ads aren't there. But if kick does decide that they want to

be legitimate and sustainable, they are going to have to change these things. And the moment kick

cuts their revenue split with the streamers,

introduces ads and also bans users because in certain categories, because it's not ad friendly.

So change the TOS, the ads or the they're, they're, they're, it's not going to be the same.

The reason that a lot of people go to kick is because a, they get that crazy content.

That's not a lot on Twitch or B the user experience of not having ads.

Ask anybody, ask anybody why they watched kick instead of Twitch. Two reasons.

The content that's allowed there. That's not allowed on Twitch or the fact that it's an ad viewing or

an ad.

ad free experience. That's the only two reasons. And why, or if they say, well, there's a certain

user that's over there. Well, why are they over there? Is it because of this or because of the

split? So if they get rid of any of these things, what, what do they have? What gives them the edge

now? No ads. Exactly. What gives them the edge? What gives kick the edge? Because right now,

a lot of people that are, you know, over there are because they can't stream on Twitch or some

of the users like it there because the content is much more edgy or they can say things or get

away with things they can't get away with here. But from a business standpoint, this isn't

sustainable. You understand what I'm saying? People don't like when I say this because they

think I have something against kick. I have nothing against kick. Fuck. I would, I almost

think about multi-streaming to kick just because why not at this point, who cares, right? All I'm

doing is, is just, just getting people that are over there to watch. Fine. If I, you know, there's

nothing wrong with it. It's not like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm losing anything. I have nothing against kick,

but as a business,

and as an investor and as probably who follows the money, this is not sustainable. I don't think

anybody thinks that kick is sustainable this way. Yeah, but stake will keep giving them money. Yeah,

but even investors at stake are finally going to, at some point say, okay, we need to see something.

And, you know, especially internationally right now with all of the chat controls and stuff like

that, right? Do you work for the CIA? Do I look like somebody who would work for the CIA?

Motherfucker, I have no filter. I couldn't keep a fucking, uh,

you know, a state secret, right? Now back to what I was saying. So yes, you know, I, I, I'm invested

in Google. That's my biggest position I have in my entire fucking retirement and my entire

investment portfolio is single position is Google. I am a huge believer in YouTube and Google and

everything like that, but YouTube is going to have to just continue to pull. Now look, think about

all the ones that, that failed, right? Microsoft, Microsoft and mixer failed. Okay. You've got,

what was the other one? Um, Facebook gaming, which I actually had a, uh, they offered me a

contract to move over there. They gave up on that. YouTube gaming is still there, but they've pulled

money, right? You've got rumble, but they're, they're, they're, they're still very new to the

game. I think rumble is the most likely to move, uh, to, to gain more market share over time just

because of the, the type of content that is there. And it's more likely to move, uh, to, to gain more

more conservative, like focused. And I think that because of that, you know, especially as we get

more device diverse, you know, or diverse divisive politically, I think people are going to be

looking for that outlet because it feels like most places are very left-leaning on the internet.

Even if that's not true, it's just what they feel like. And so I think rumble has a chance to gain

the most market share in the next two to three years, um, as a, as a percentage of their current

view count, but you had all kinds of them. You have all kinds of them coming out there. I mean,

everybody was doing it.

Everybody was doing it. And I mean, even trading view started one up. They actually offered me

not nearly enough, but they offered me to move my live stream to trading view to be their

premier, you know, streamer. Everybody wants to get into live streaming. It's the future.

It's the future. Like we're turning into the Truman show. People are looking to, they can't

go out as much. They can't afford to go out as much or COVID really fucked everything up.

Everyone's looking for that.

That human interacts or that feeling of hanging out with people. And if you can't do it in real

life, you can do it in your game lobby and stuff like that. But then what if you don't want to play

games? What if you just want to sit and chill, right? Or you don't want to, you know, whatever

like that. That's where live streaming comes in. It's not about the streamer anymore, right? Live

streaming is no more about the streamer. It's about the community. I mean, look at, look at

Forsen for example, right? I found out about that guy a couple of years ago because him and I are

in the same agency. This guy literally just sits there and plays games. Okay.

Sits there and plays games, puts what most people would call minimal effort,

makes a grunt every now and then, and averages 10,000 viewers. It's not about the streamer.

It's about the community. And I think a lot of, a lot of younger or a lot of newer streamers don't

understand this. They're all like, do you think I should have this really good camera? Do you

think I should do this game? Do I think I should do this, interact with this? It's not about all

that. Okay. I have, I do finance and I have one of the most scuffed setups in the world.

Right. It's not about necessarily you. You're, you're the big part of it. You're the, you're the

captain of the ship, but the community and the community you build and the inside jokes and the

engagement and the, and the things, that's what keeps people right. That's what keeps people.

And that's why I'm talking about live streaming because people want to be a part of something.

Right. Why do you think politics are the way they are? And, and everything online is so divisive

and everybody's split and tribal right now because everyone wants to feel like something. Everybody

wants to have a fucking diagnosis or a mental, you know,

mental health designation or some kind of disability or something like that. Like people

want to feel like they're included. And so that's what it is. And so live streaming is the future.

It's not going anywhere. Okay. Guys together. If we work together, we can make me rich as a

community. Let's all come together in harmony to give me money. I thought the big reset would

happen over the weekend. Why, why do you know how much cash is on the sidelines waiting to be

deployed? All right. Beyond the,

beyond me, it's still going. Um, IO and Q good entry there. We waited for the pullback,

missed it by about a minute or two on the bottom, but nice, nice pickup there.

TVRD by the way, guys, this is the one that we jumped into and we still don't know why

from this morning. Uh, but we are now up 25% on this for two months. We're up 25% on this and we

are up. Oh, I got stopped out of beyond me. I got stopped out of beyond me. Nevermind.

I'm out now. Okay. You guys have fun. I got stopped out right under a dollar.

That's okay.

I'll take 30%. Um, and any 13%, we are right up to $51. Again. We bought some more of that on

Friday. Don't think too bad. I don't have any more of those calls left. St. Gaty five justice

subbed for 24 Google 3% Evgo 10%. I wish we had, do we, do we have Evgo leaps? No, we don't. Right?

No, that's an L right there. Uh, mirror, by the way, back over 24, up 33% on those, uh, 20, 28

leaps. Um,

waiting for Amat to come through. Amat's up 50% right now. Should be one of our sellers should

have hit already. Remember by the dip and sell the rip. Make sure that you, you guys are being

very cautious with your, uh, um, with your, with your, with your stuff. I'm not telling you to sell

everything, but if you bought, like if you went big heavy on the dip on, um, on Friday, make sure

you're legging out of some of that stuff. Okay. I bought my second house because of NNE. Thanks.

2,698 just for subbed for 16 months. All right.

And beyond there is open a, I just passing around the billion dollars they have with several other

companies. Oh yeah. It's, it's a circle jerk with Broadcom. Does this billion dollars actually

exist? No, but money isn't real. I mean, the world is $315 trillion in debt. So fuck it. Right? Like

who are we borrowing from? Damn TVRD still going. That was an accidental good pickup this morning.

All right. Legged out on my first Amat leap, uh, or call that we got. Um, so we're doing all right

there.

Uh, AEHR waiting for that to get another bounce there. Joby calls. Let's go ahead and start

selling. Those are up 20% today. I'm AB up 19%. You still in? No. Okay. Legged out of Joby. Legged

out of Amat. Beyond still going. I'm out of that. Uh, IONQ really good pickup. I'm going to tighten

my stop loss on this up. All right. So we've got back half of what we lost on Friday. I shouldn't

say lost. We were down because you only lose if you sell, right? Uh, we got plug up 18% for those

of you guys that went back in, uh, NNE 15%. We got Google air. Oh, what do we got? Holy shit.

Plug 17%. UUU 25%. We are now up 375% on UUU. Uh, plug up 17%. Uh, we got NNE up 15%.

Evgo 11%. Dpro 11%. NVX 10%. TSSI 9%. JZXI is 8%. NVNI is, why do I own this? Uh, WeRide

6% back to 11 bucks. StubHub is up 6%. Uh, Joby 6%. Uh, MLGO three and a half. Aerie.

Gur. Venu.

Do we have anything red today? Yeah, just the Divis. Okay. By the way, TBH is going to be a

funny one to watch. We're up 27% on TVRD now. IONQ is going nuts. Verizon was my worst shadow

of all time. Honestly, I'll be re I'll be real with you. Verizon didn't work out. I still think

it's going to, it's going to bounce back, uh, over the next month or two. But, um, the amount

of fucking absolute insane runs we had and one L I'll take it. I'll take it any day.

Uh, we got MO down 2% shit. Last time MO was down two. Fuck. I'm going to have to do it.

I just got to take longer than Verizon longer out. Watch this. Watch this. Watch when I take this,

the MO calls. Watch. This'll be the one that moons in two days. It's like, unlike Verizon.

And because I'm playing safe, it's whatever. All right. So I'm going to go ahead and grab me a,

uh, December, um, 60, 65 call. No, a little too expensive right now. What's the IV on that? 22%.

Actually, 67 fives are pretty cheap. The, just the, the, the, the, um, fuck the, uh, the,

the spread is too, too bad though. What about January, January, 67 fives are okay. Those are

better. I'm going to do that. Um, again, just because it's MO and, uh, do you keep fast with

your wife? You mean, did I fast with my wife for the thing? No, she didn't. Um, I tried years ago

and she just didn't want me to, because it was more along the lines of, um,

along the lines of just not something she wanted to do, or she, she, she didn't want me to do it

because it's about me or whatever. I don't know. It is what it is. You know, I try to respect my

wife and, and, and support her in these things. Your background is empty. Yeah. Clearing it out,

boys. Got to take some stuff with me. Got to throw some stuff away. Uh, the crazy thing is,

is that we are donating about 80% of the shit we own because, um, we're going, we're staying

in a furnished place for six months up there. So we don't need to bring anything. And, uh,

you know, we're probably going to rent this place out, even though it's going to take me a lot of

work. Uh, so I've been clearing stuff out. Um, it's going to be, uh, donations of tax write-off.

Nah, not really. Um, they don't really give you like a, a number. They just give you like a,

a slip that says you donated. Um, so we're going to be donating most of it. Um, why not give the

stuff to the renter? Because when you rent out apartment, if you're only giving them like

use a couple of used things,

it's weird. Either you have to be fully furnished or nothing, because if you offer them like, Hey,

listen, we're going to rent this out. You get one bed, one half working TV, a couple plates,

and that, that, that, that thing over there, you actually end up losing more potential renters

than you gain because there's people that just want a blank canvas that are going to see that

and be like, nah, I'm good. You know what I mean? Or if they don't want it, they're going to ask

you to remove it. And if you live somewhere else, so either you give it fully furnished

or completely blank. And I think a lot of people misunderstand how that works because people are

like, yeah, but I spent money on these things and somebody else is going to want it because it's

worth money. No, just because you spent money or because it's worth it to you doesn't mean it's

worth something to someone else. So when they walk into a master bedroom, if they see a master

bedroom that's completely open, they can do what they want with it. But if you've got like a used

mattress and fucking platform bed in the middle of the room, that's it. It's kind of like, you

know what I mean? It looks like some kind of like Eastern European hostel. I love how she goes,

Oh my God, we're really moving. See, like,

it's like, we're, we're, we're moving. It's true though. That's how you feel. Cause we've been

together in this room for six years. You know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's weird.

You should have a community yard sale, man. Go to hell. I don't want to do more yard sales.

Although if there's anybody in this community who lives in South Florida, knows anybody in South

Florida who actually needs stuff, please let me know. I'm more than happy to, to, to, to let them

take stuff. We've got, you know, you name it. I mean, I got, you know, giant Keurig I'm donating

and we've got, um, you know, uh,

plates. We've got, uh, appliances. We've got, um, I mean so much stuff we're donating

shelves, you know, uh, dressers, um, baby stuff. We've got, uh, all my, a lot of my,

my sponsor shirts are going out, are going to donation. Not that you guys are going to take

that, but I'm giving away all that stuff. After how much you said it's going to cost you after

you move up there, you should probably do an auction. No, bro. I got to figure out how we're

going to pay for that. I got to figure out how we're going to fucking pay for this. Let me tell

you this shit. We're going to be paying.

Listen to this. 3,000 a month for rent and everything. 2,000 a month for one kid's school

up there and another 2,000 for the other kids. What the, where the fuck am I getting seven

grand a month from? What am I supposed to fucking do? Bro, what the fuck? 3k for rent. Well,

it's 2,700 a month plus, you know, utilities, but we're getting a fully furnished four bedroom,

three bathroom house. You're putting your kids in private school. Well, my, my daughter's

four going on five and my son is going to be three.

In March. So yeah, I'm not putting them in public school. This room holds so many memories,

but I want you guys to look at Northern because remember this is only until we find a place to

buy up there, but I want you to look at Northern Delaware fucking public schools and you'll

understand nothing wrong with public school. No, it's not that it's that we want the kids

to go to school together. Um, and you know, uh, the, the pre-K for the, the, the, the three-year-olds

to the five-year-olds, you know, I want them in the same school.

Yeah. I want them to go to school. I want them to go to school. I want them to go to school.

I want them to go to school. I want them to go to school. I want them to go to school.

Sell IO and Q at 70, 25. When my stop loss kicks me out, I'll get out. All right. Stub back over 20

here. Which MO calls did you take? Uh, I took the, um, January 67, five calls. I got them for 200

a piece. Should've moved to Southern superior Delaware. No, no, we haven't moved. We're only

there because we want to see, we want to see how the weather affects my condition. Number one. And

number two, we want to give ourselves time to be able to look for a house. Cause if you are living

in Florida, trying to buy a home in Delaware, number one, we want to give ourselves time to look

at it, see how it goes, see how the roads are in the winter and how, you know, whatever. Number

one, number two, you want to give yourself time to buy, especially cause I feel like I'm going

into a time when the housing market is going to cool off or it's going to be better for, for

buyers. And I want to see how my condition goes. So, um, you know, because, because I, I, I, I'm

getting worse. You know what I mean? Like I'm coming out of my regression cycle and I, I, I,

I wasn't able to do much this weekend. I couldn't stand much and I wasn't able to walk

much. So I want to see how the weather affects that before we decide to move. And if we don't,

we'll come back down here. Of course, my wife wants to rent this place out within two months

of us leaving. So we'll have to figure something out. Um, but, uh, I got to come back and fix,

fix this place up anyways, paint the walls and fix some holes in the walls and shit. But, uh,

um, that's why I wanted to turn that around as a secondary source of income. But, uh, but we want

to check it out first before we do that. How much are you renting it out for? Uh, we haven't decided

yet. I think we're probably going to rent it. It's a full house. I think we're probably going to be

on something like that. Pretty cheap. Our neighbors who rent out are probably gonna be

pissed off. I don't know. I haven't talked to my wife about it, but a full two bedroom,

two bathroom house with, uh, you know, fully renovated with bamboo floors and black slate

walls and fucking, uh, you know, uh, uh, full patio that's screened in and the whole nine yards

on the corner here and they say with good schools and everything. Yeah. It's a steal. It's a steal.

Not fence. You dipshits. Does your HOA allow it? Yeah. They have to do like a, um,

are you renting it out if you don't want to be a landlord? Because my wife,

I just want to talk about it. We're going to be, I'm going to be hiring a property management

company to, to deal with it. But yeah, other than that, and it's, it is sold. Does it come

with the fence? No, it's not. There's no fence. Okay. Uh, am I down on anything right now?

Oh shit. We bought TDIC a little while ago at 64. It's already, it's already up 20%.

I don't even know what the fuck this is. Oh shit. It got all the way to 80. I didn't even see that.

That's kind of stupid.

56 months. 56 months. All right. I'm going to grab some more STSS shares.

I am on my paternity leave for one month. My three month old son and I are watching you.

My baby wants to say something to stop key.

Listen, I know it's okay. I understand it. It can be difficult having a special needs kid.

Um, but I feel like your wife has been taking care.

Of you for several years that she'll be a good mother to your child. Okay.

Stop still holding up. Ooh, we might've caught the bottom on MO. I don't want to get excited yet, but

can you explain pre-market buying? Yeah. So basically, uh, pre-market is, you know,

obviously not everybody has access to it, but, uh, pre-market buying is basically where

there is lower volume and there's much more wild swings and there's no stop losses available.

So there's a lot more risk involved, but pre-market post-market though is,

is when announcements happen or people try to get into positions.

Uh, and take advantage of that. Sometimes though, there's nothing you can do because

front-running happens very, very, uh, very, very quickly pre-market. And you'll notice like people

will be like, well, I don't understand why my fill didn't get filled or why I got a worse fill or

something like that. You have to understand something. The difference between microseconds,

milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds is everything. And you are getting front run

nonstop. You guys, maybe not because you have smaller orders, but if you do any type of large

order, especially if you're a big business, you're going to get a lot of orders. So if you're

on a low volume or low float stock or low market cap stock, you're getting front run.

It's just part of what you're doing. And that's why I like to put in buy orders at like different

levels or sellers at different levels, because I want to fuck with the, the, the algo, but,

uh, or not the algo, but the, uh, the, the computers and with quantum, it's only going

to get faster. So it's much more dangerous. But the reason that I like to position myself

pre-market is because I like to get, if it's a positive catalyst or a negative catalyst,

I like to buy or sell before retail. And before everyone else has the ability

to push you to the next level. So I like to get, if it's a positive catalyst or a negative catalyst,

I like to push it up or down because that is kind of like, okay, if this is a catalyst

and people are interested in it based on whatever the market open is and whatever the, the, the,

the momentum is, people are going to jump or in or buy out of this thing. And if I can

get in pre-market and I, and I'm correct about the, the, the, the direction I can then, you

know, ride that momentum one way or the other. Doesn't front running get called out by larger

firms? It's against the rule. Hmm. I don't know how to explain this to you, man. Oh,

see, we don't, we don't have those things.

I don't have to follow rules anymore, man. Used to, we used to, those were the days.

All right. Let's let's hop in and see what we got on our options.

Holy shit. Mirror is going wild. Um, fly up pretty nicely. Um, we got till rate puts are

starting to come back to life. Not by a lot, but we're getting there.

IV crush was insane on those sake. I was at the bank of America marathon, and I swear to God,

someone look like you? It wasn't me, bro. My ass ain't running marathons these days.

Oh, we know? Okay, listen here, son. All right. That was toxic. I know, right? I'm kidding. Ha,

ha, ha. No, you ain't. Don't back down now. All right. Other stuff that we were looking at today

that was really interesting this morning. A lot going on with China tariffs and everything like

that, which is funny because Representative Khanna, who's coming on later, actually just

returned from China. Y'all remember how we found out about that weird little subcommittee he was on?

Apparently, him as a representative of that subcommittee, he was just in China. So I want

to ask him about that and see what they're hearing and what they're thinking about with

all this terror stuff. A lot of back and forth. Feels like, I can't prove this, but it feels like

what happened on Friday was kind of set up. Again, just feels that way, and I'll talk about it.

And yeah, there you go. We talked about 38% of workers tapped into retirement savings led by Gen Z.

Gen Z credit scores have collapsed to an average FICO of 676. And in other news, in other news,

Indian households now hold $3.8 trillion worth of gold, which is equivalent to 89%

of the country's GDP.

Households now hold $3.8 trillion worth of gold. Excuse me. Most Indian households hit that L

counter. Nah, bro, that's a constant L. What is this? Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Are you kidding me?

Not yours, though? Thank you. That was the joke. It's so weird seeing the wall of means slowly

fade away. Okay, bro. Okay. First off, we are moving. Okay. We're not ending. Okay. I realized

that six years ago, we were moving. We were moving. We were moving. We were moving. We were

moving. So you want to know what's funny? The first decorations I ever had, this was back when

I first started streaming. I was like a month into streaming. And it was like 10 people who watched

my stream. I did this thing where I went around and I went to yard sales. And I told everybody,

I'm going to live stream yard sales. And if you see something you want me to buy,

donate the money, right, for how much it costs. I'll use the money to buy it and I'll put it in

the back. And it was like two giant stuffed fish and some other weird shit. And my bed was here

and there was a giant teddy bear. And I was like, I'm going to live stream yard sales. And I'm going

at least keep the J portrait up till the end. This is fucked. I hate this. There's no end.

There's no end. It's a new beginning. We're just moving, guys. We're all moving. Okay. It's a road

trip. Oh, shit. I got stopped out of IONQ. Oh, no. 7706. No. That's all right. Maybe it was a good

thing. What a good play. Sad to see it's finally the end. No, I don't want to move. What do you

mean you don't want to move? It's going to be a bigger room. We get our own room, guys.

We get our own room.

I've seen with a lot of streamers. Listen, anytime a politician wants to come on, I'm more

than happy to. Somebody asked me the other day, he said, Stocky, you've had AOC, Brian Deese,

and now Ro Khanna on. Why don't you ever have Republicans on? Because they don't. They always

say no. Literally, Thomas Massey. I reached out to his team and was like, hey, would you be

interested in coming on here? And they're like, no. I was like, what the fuck? I understand why.

Because Twitch, when they think of Twitch and politics, obviously they think of,

you know, what the headlines talk about. And it seems like a very hostile environment

for them. But I'm not a political ideology streamer. I'm not trying to push an ideology

or bring up a narrative. I talk about politics in relation to economics and finance. But I think

there's just that bad feeling there. But it's not about that. I'm more than happy to bring on

anybody from any party. It doesn't even have to have a party. It's just people from the

Republican Party don't come on here. I don't know why.

It has nothing to do with a preference here. It has nothing to do with a preference here. I love

having people that have inside knowledge and have, you know, the, you know what I mean, like inside

workings of the government and budget and economics and like whatever to talk about this

stuff. Because that's where you kind of gain the knowledge, right? I can speculate about this stuff

all I want. But, you know, hearing it from them, it's like, okay, let me ask you. You're somebody

who actually has a vote on this. Let's hear what your thoughts are. And so that's why,

like, having them on. But it's not for lack of trying. I mean, I don't reach out to everybody.

Like, I don't DM every fucking politician, but politicians, CEOs, I've had CEOs on for lots of

different companies. You know, it's hard to believe, but like, you know, it is what it is.

But like, you know, not everybody's going to say yes. Not everyone's going to say yes. Because not

everybody wants, especially live streaming, because a lot of people are concerned that

with live streaming, there's like, if something is said, then it can be taken, you know, you can't

because it's not like an edited video. But with me, I don't do I gotchas. I don't do like

hit pieces. I don't do any of that. I just like to talk and to learn and to discuss and have you

guys be here as part of it. Because, you know, you're always seeing it on like some news

organization or something pre-recorded or something like that. Here, it's us talking

and we get to do it. You know what I mean? Do you still drink that coffee you pushed?

You mean the whole bean coffee? Like, I only have the whole beans and yeah, I drink it.

It's called Kona beans.

It's made from Hawaiian Kona beans because I grew up in Hawaii. Madrinas? Yeah, I have,

it's whole bean coffee though. I don't do the powdered one anymore. That was more for younger

audience people. And so once the GameStop, you know, viewership kind of leveled off and everything

like that, I just went to the whole bean coffee because that's what I drink. Here's the good news.

One day we'll have to answer for our life and we would deserve hell for our evil, lies, stealing,

hatred, unclean thoughts. But Jesus paid the punishment we deserved. Then he rose again and

offers forgiveness and a hope that he will never again. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

It goes beyond the earth. So what you're saying is, is that I can keep doing that shit now

because of that, right? Right. I'm good now, right? Thanks for selling IONQ. I didn't sell it. I got

stopped out. All right. I really don't know what to do with AMAT here. We got 50% now today. Um,

well, 41% now today, which only puts us break even because of how bad the dip was on Friday.

And I couldn't, I didn't have any leftover capital.

So I'm kind of deciding what I want to do here. I feel like I'm going to hold on to the three of

them. No blurbs will not be on during the interview. Don't ask again. It is not. No, no, no, no. I don't

care what you say. You can call me anything you want. No, they are not going to be on. You are

out of your mind. If you think I'm leaving blurbs on when I'm having that talk, there is just no way

you guys are absolutely insane. If you think that that is staying on, it's part of the stream. You

know what? There's a lot of things that are part of the stream.

Okay. It's not censorship. It's not censorship. Okay. That is not censorship. That is just human

decency because I won't be able to talk. Okay. Raise blurb to a thousand. I should put it a

hundred bucks a pop. Then you guys will shut the fuck up. Stocky hates the second amendment. What

the fuck does that have to do with this? Okay. That TDIC play was really lucky. Are we still

in TVRD or did that get stopped out yet? What was your fill on STSS? Uh, 552. Nope. TVRD still in

it. Looking good.

22% still. Stopped out of beyond meat earlier. Uh, right at a dollar. That's okay. It was a good

play. 30% on that. Playing TDIC right now. Still in that. What else are we still in? Um, what was

the other one we took this morning? I forgot. Oh, we sold some poet this morning at 788. MNTS. We

got out at 152 on the spike this morning and now, now back in some of it. Oh, climb is the other

one. CLYM. We're up six, uh, about 1% of that.

Go ahead and put a 3% trailing stop loss on that. Just so I have that, um, ready to go. Okay. Big,

big day today. Holy shit. IONQ. No, no, I'm already out of IONQ. Um, that was a nice play.

We jumped in. We watched the pullback because we were watching it for a pre-market. Damn it. The

1% thing got me again on CLYM. Damn it. Well, I guess I'm green. Green's green, I guess. Yeah.

TDIC is wild. I don't even know what this is. I just saw it. I was like, all right, fine. Why not?

Cause there is no cock like horse cock.

Go into shock. You need horse cock. Of course, cock. Grab the loom the day.

Y'all are so stupid. Uh, Stocky, what I don't understand is how not to bag hold stocks. Like

if I buy something and it goes down 12%, do I sell or keep it because it's probably going to go back

up? Well, it depends on why you're in it. Are you in it because it's some YOLO shit you saw somewhere?

Is it something you're just like, Oh, this fell a lot one day. So it's got to go back up. Is it

somewhat, is it that, or is it something you really are like in for, for a reason?

If it's something that you're in for, for a reason,

and, and there's, there's no real like immediate timeframe on it.

Then you just buy little bits every, so a certain amount down, right?

I've bought stuff and it's gone down 10, 12, 15% before. And I'm like, all right,

every 10% down, I'll buy a little bit more. And then it comes back up. I can think of a lot of

stocks that were down like that, uh, that I kept buying that ended up going absolutely insane. I

mean, fuck, look at you, you, you, for example, we've got into you, you, you, it fell like 10%.

Then it went up like 30%. Then it fell down 40%. Then it was up. It, you know, it was up.

And now here we are at 400% up, right? Like

to wait it out. And then it, you do is, is let's say you have, you want to, you want to hold a

thousand shares of something, right? Let's say whatever. And you buy, you don't leg in. Let's

say you just buy a thousand shares of it. Well, let's say it done 10%. Well, you buy 200 more

shares. Okay. And then another 10% 200 more shares. Now you're at 1400 shares. Well, if it

goes up 10%, you sell 200 of those up 10%. You sell 200, you've made money. You're back to break

even. And you still have your original thousand shares, right? You can, you can leg in, or you

can buy and then DCA down or, or average down and then sell on the way up. Sometimes

it takes a week, a month. The problem is, is that we're so used to things being instant

gratification that if we buy something and it's not a 10% in a week, we feel like it's a failure.

Or if you buy something and it's down 10% in a month or 15%, you feel like a fucking failure.

I mean, look what happened with GPUS, right? That's a little bit degen, but we bought that.

We were buying that shit all the way down. And then it ran 2000% or 200 or 400% or whatever.

Like you just have to wait. GPUS is a bad example, but like if it's, if it's a conviction play,

or if it's something that you're really into, you have to understand that not everything you buy

immediately goes up. And it's not that you're,

wrong about a position. It's that it's not that you're wrong about a position. It's just that

sometimes, you know, you're early to it or money is moving elsewhere for different reasons that

have nothing to do with that position. Was that a blur? What was, what a blur? All right. NNE 12%,

EVGO 12%, um, guilt 5%, plug 15%, TSSI 8%. Uh, what do we got here? Uh, JZXN. Let's go ahead

and put another stop loss on that. Okay. We've got some dry powder here. What is that from?

Oh, it's cause of the accidental sell on, uh, on climb. All right. Rivian doing good. We ride

almost at 11 again. Just waiting for stub, man. I don't know what's taking that thing so long.

God damn you, you, you, we are now at 370% on that. That's insane.

NVX had a wild run this morning too. For those of you guys that were, um, in there pre like

early, early this morning, that was up. Um, it got a 50% at one point this morning.

What is TBH and why did I buy it? Oh, that's that stupid SPAC that's coming out.

All right.

Tesla. I'm gonna do it with you. Okay. I'm gonna run. I'm gonna run GPUS with you. Okay.

It's at 42. All right. Waiting for him to talk here. Yo, check NVIDIA. Are you still in plug?

Of course. How could I not be at this point, man? I don't know what to do with AMAT here.

I feel like it's going to run again, but am I willing to risk it? Watch Trump come out and say

some shit again. Jesus mirror is going, huh? What about max? How dare you bring that and say that

name? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Name. Okay. Yeah. That sucks. So IONQ was our main play today. Uh, waited for it to pull back,

grabbed into it and then got stopped out here. And of course it is going up, but that's because

of the quantum news today. But we also talked during the call this morning about why, um,

why these stocks tend to, um, be the ones that sell off the most during something like this,

but then also get bought up the most. And we figured during a rip, when everybody's buying

retails, buying up that dip, they need one with a catalyst and the catalyst for them was the big

one this morning. So that's why we're doing it. And then we're doing it. And then we're doing it.

That's why we kind of focused on IONQ today. I don't know what TDIC is. I'm glad it's going up

though. And then stub obviously already in it, but hoping for another run today off of all of the,

um, off of all of the, uh, the, the, the upgrades today, it got like a, I think seven different,

uh, initiations this morning. CRML. Yeah. All of them are. Did you see NVX? I mean,

we've been in UU for years, you know what I mean? And then, um, NNE and then we all,

by the way, we got us a new fresh meat in the, uh, in the nuclear sector coming out.

Made 30% on Oracle options today, but it's still running. Imagine being up 30% on something on

Friday and not selling because you thought it would run a little bit more and then losing it

all. That didn't happen. So take your money and run. Is NVX becoming your long-term or just

swinging it? No, no, no. NVX has become a long-term. Well, I don't want to say long-term

because I don't know, you know, like, like I don't really have a timeframe on it, but when we got into

NVX a couple of years or last year or earlier this year, whatever it was, it's because of the

graphite and the DOE contract and the plant and the facility. And we knew that, especially with

the Trump administration and the whole America stuff like that, like they were going to be in

demand. And you know, a lot of it is off of the future potential for them. They haven't even

like built the facility yet. Nuclear meat? No, not nuclear meat.

B-0B-4,444 just resubbed for six months. I think I'm actually going to stop using TOS

because there is no way in any world that a platform should default to these things like this.

That's insane.

Still going lower. I haven't been in geo in a while. What do you think of orbs? Oh shit. We

made some orbs was our hero on Friday. We traded orbs like four or five times on Friday. We're

going to jail for this one. This TD thing, 15% on second run here. We traded orbs a bunch of times

on Friday. It was a hero. It was an absolute fucking hero on Friday. I traded, I don't know

what was going on with it. I forgot why we, the reason I'd have to go back to the notes from

Friday freebies, but we traded a bunch of times.

And ended up clearing 9% for the day on it. And it was off of something. I can't, was it,

was it the AI thing? Is Verizon still a play? I think Verizon is going to have a massive comeback.

I just, it's going to, the Divi just happened. So I think it's going to be probably next month,

maybe. So I'm going to have to roll it out. I think I just, I think I just, this is the problem.

I made the mistake of doing that thing where I took a shorter dated option. And that's why my MO,

I just took for January as opposed to November, because here's the thing.

Be correct about a, I'm not saying I will be, but you can be correct about something. It just

takes a little bit longer to get going. And if you don't give yourself the time you fuck yourself,

right? Cause you think of, Oh, well, if I take it shorter dated and I'm right, and it happens now,

I'm going to make a bunch. So I'm really, I really think that Verizon is is, is set for a big

rebound. It's just, when does that ball get rolling? And I think it's just, I just went to,

I just got into early. It happens. You know, I just, I just got into early for it.

What's your mix between buying shares or

options of these kinds of plays? So generally, if it's something that I want to be in for a,

like a day trade, it's just option. I mean, just, just shares.

If it's something that I want to be in and be able to average down on, it's something I want to like

invest in for a trend or for longer, like a year or two or something like that. Then I buy shares

as well. If it's something that I'm speculating on, but I don't want to tie up so much capital,

I'll play an option on it because I'm basically just, you know,

leveraging the same position. So for example, if I have $10,000 worth of shares, right, I can put,

I can buy $10,000 in a lump sum or leg in or whatever, and then put a 6% trailing stop loss,

right? So what do I do? I, I, I have $600 is my max loss, right? So either $600 is my max loss

or $600, you know, or unlimited game or whatever. I put my, my stop loss up. Cause if it goes up

a hundred dollars and then falls at 500 loss, four or three up to a profitable,

I have to tie up $10,000. And if I want to use that for dips for my long-term or for my swing

trades or for day trading, whatever, I don't want to tile that capital up. But if I'm willing to

risk the 600 over that same period of time, I could just buy $600 in leaps of the same position.

And if for some reason it just goes to zero, which it's not going to, but it goes to zero.

Well, it's the same max loss that I offered myself with the $10,000 in capital.

It's the same loss, right? Because if you're in a leap and it goes to zero, you've lost more than 6%

anyway. So you're really, you're going to lose a lot of money. And if you're in a leap and it goes to

zero, you're really giving yourself the same amount of downside risk.

But if it moves up in a short period of time, you can actually make more than you would on the

shares because of that volatility and sell for a gain or whatever, and not tie up the rest of the

capital. The problem is, is people don't look at it that way. They look at, I'm only going to do

options because this is how I'm going to make money. It's like, no, I want to do this, but

I'm going to take six months to a year out leap on this position, tie up the same amount of capital

as potential loss with the shares. But instead of tying up $10,000 in shares, I'm just putting

that same $600 on the line that I am for that position. And if it jumps, you can sell it

immediately. Let's say, let's say it goes up a 10%, right? You make 60 bucks, it goes up a hundred

percent or 50%, you make 300 bucks, right? That's like 3% on those shares, but a 1% move could move

that. You see what I'm saying? Like obviously to each their own with experience, but it just

depends on what I'm looking at. So for example, um, applied material, the reason I jumped into

Amet on Friday was because I was looking at the, the China, um, export curbs and stuff that they

had put in before Trump made his announcement, uh, that he retracted on. Um, but, uh, but the

reason that I did that was I was like, okay, well I don't, you know, Amet's at 300 something dollars

a share, right? Like I don't want to tie up, you know, 30 shares here, you know, for, for, for,

you know, whatever, but I'll give myself a max loss of, of, of, you know, 500 bucks or whatever.

And so by buying, um, by buying, you know, the position at, you know, $500 a piece for the call,

I'm only tying up that same 5%. However, it fell. So I ended up averaging down. So I ended up giving

myself instead of $20,000 in capital for potential of, of a max thousand dollar loss. I'm only,

I only gave myself a thousand. And so I added, and then it came back up today, but these are

for December. So I wasn't really worried about,

you know, losing it. You don't have to worry about losing it all because Amet's not going to

zero. Well, 67, five MO calls mean you need to go beyond a all-time high with that premium.

I'm not, I'm not planning on holding it that long. I own a shitload of MO shares. I also

oftentimes sell covered calls on MO. Whenever, whenever MO gets to above $66, I start selling

fucking covered calls on it. This is, Hey, all I need is for MO to get back to, you know,

I mean, look at, look at the Greeks on this thing. All right. So what would the gain loss be on your

LLI leap stocky? I'm not looking at LLI. I sold that for like $1,500 profit. And the next day it

was up $6,000 a night and it crushed me, but it was still a good play. I own LLY shares ever since

the insiders were buying up like crazy after the dip I did. So basically for my MO calls, right?

I'm not holding, planning on holding these long, right? Like for example, I don't hold something

more than 5% of the money per month. But if I take something, if I plan on trading something,

within a week, I take three months out, right? If I, if I, if I plan on trading something over

the course of a month, I'll take six months out. Like I like to give myself time because days like

Friday, people that are short dated got absolutely fucking wiped out, wiped out. If you know, if you

realize the amount of retail traders that got wiped out on Friday, it would make you cry inside.

Nobody talks about it because all the fucking discord sellers and all the fucking signals and

all the fucking course sellers and shit.

Like dad are going to be like, yep, this is part of the game. Oh, shouldn't risk more than you want

to lose all the while when it's going up. Yeah, man, fucking let's go. Keep rolling it. Let's

fucking go. Right. But they got wiped the fuck out because they're all trying to sell a dream

of making so much money with so much risk in a short period of time. One day like that wiped out.

I took a hit. I took a hit on my portfolio, but because I'm a slow gainer and a slow loser,

right? Like with that, like I put that risk. I still,

even with the dip, look, right. Just over, I want to give you a three month timeframe because

I want you to see what I'm talking about as far as where it is. Right. I may not have a vertical

portfolio, but let me show you something. This was the Friday dip. Okay. Pretty decent size dip,

but because my shit is so much, I keep, I keep less risk and I, and I, whatever

the dip was significantly lower. There are people out there who did this,

okay. Margin calling. Okay. I took a dip, right? I was down 6%. Pretty big dip,

but in an options portfolio, that's not that much. Sure. I could be up 149%, right? Instead of 49%,

but I also would have lost 60, 70, 80%. And then, you know, what's going to happen to those people?

They probably bought all the way down until it was a dollar or two for their fucking contract,

trying to average down.

And they've lost everything. Okay. So, and remember with this portfolio,

every time I get above a certain amount, I would draw money so that I don't over-risk it.

Ghost zero airbay just resubbed for 35 months. Boomers.

You see what I mean? So you see how I have that, that, that buying power left

because I, I, I don't want to have all my money exposed, right? Buy the dip, sell the rips.

Can you explain a bit of market behavior? Mere $30, 20, 28 leaps are down despite the stock being

up today. Is that simply due to small volume or such a far out?

Is there some other mechanism at play? Well, generally it's a good thing. If,

if your longer dated leaps are falling in value while the stock is up, that usually is a good

thing because that usually means there's one of two, well, it could be good or bad.

Good because it means more buyers are in there, which is tightening up the spread,

which could make it lower than what it closed at the previous day, because there was,

there was less interest, meaning that the, the, the ask bid was much wider,

or it could be the,

opposite. If there's only two calls trading, maybe one is up. There's a spread issue right

now. So let me take a look at them right now until I tell you any comment on the open AI

situation, which is a microphone. Um, I just read that they committed 10 gigawatts of broad,

uh, broadband right after. Yes. Open AI is literally just cycling money. I drew the thing

for you. It's on my, my, my, my socials. It's literally just here's a hundred,

a hundred billion dollar investment. Cool. All right, cool. Now, um, we're going to take that

hundred billion and we're going to invest with this company. Okay. Well that company is now

going to give a hundred billion dollars to this company. Well, that company is now giving a hundred

billion to open AI. Well, open AI is now giving a hundred billion dollars to there. Well, they're

giving a hundred billion dollars to NVIDIA. NVIDIA is getting NVIDIA. NVIDIA is due. NVIDIA just did

a, a, a multi like a, like a, like a, like a $20 billion investment into XAI. By the way, XAI is

paying NVIDIA 18 billion to rent their GPUs. I'm gonna say that again. NVIDIA makes a $20 billion

investment into XAI. XAI turns around and spends $18 billion and gives it to NVIDIA to,

to rent their GPUs. Do you understand what's going on right now? This is just one big circle

jerk, except they're just bringing more people in. This is like Guinness world record kind of

thing. I'm just waiting for we, uh, we ride to get involved because they have been sitting in

the cuck chair of this, of this, of this circle for a while. Is it legal? Technically it's legal.

Why would it be illegal? I'm not saying it should be legal, but why would it be illegal?

It's like when somebody buys a quadplex as an investment property, they can then go to the

bank and use the future potential rent on that as, as, as a line for equity to borrow against

to buy another property and do that over and over and over again. Dude, we can ask Mr. Mr.

Kana when he comes on today. Listen, there's a channel in discord. It says questions for Ro Khanna

ask these questions. I'm going to discuss a few things with him that we're talking. We already

planned on talking about, and then I'm going to hop in there. I'm not going to ask you some of

y'all's dumb ass questions, but put them in there. I'll be more than happy to, to, to, if we have

time to do it.

To bring them up. Did you get stopped out on MNTS? I would need a stop loss to get stopped

out. I actually got, so I had a, um, random, uh, sell order for one 52 this morning and I saw it

got filled. I was like, what the hell happened? It spiked up to one 52 and then came right back.

I was like, all right, cool. Oh my God. I bought into a stock and it's going down for the two days

since I bought into it. Fucking loss. I'm selling. Okay. Do you think that the AI speculation is

similar to the.com bubble or is it something new and entirely different? Completely different.

It doesn't mean that we're not going to fall. It's just, you, you, you can't base the 2000.com

bubble, which was based on a lot of fake shit that wasn't ever going to happen, but people were just

scrambling for money versus speculating on something that is going to happen. And everyone

just trying to get in early. Um, these are real companies. Even if they don't make money,

they're real companies. They have products. They're not just random websites that have.com

at the end with no product and nothing.

And people are just pumping them. So yes, it's just a different type of bubble.

Okay. How long are you going to do that until I look over and make you happy?

Put some pants on. I wasn't thinking about you at all. Oh, okay. Oh, oh, you didn't have to say

it out loud. Oh, like even if that's true, you don't have to say it. Like you could just like

keep that one to yourself. Is she still coming with you to Twitch con? Yeah.

Which is crazy because like we, we, I've got like all these like invites for like different,

uh, events and, and, and things and parties and stuff like that. But like every one of these like

major like events, they're like no plus ones. And I have to be like, Hey guys, um, I know you said

no plus ones, but my wife's coming with me. And, uh, yeah, you know how it is. Can you make an

exception? I mean, I'm just being real. Like I'm not going to leave my wife behind to go to an

event. That's just fucked up. But at the same time, I gotta be like, Hey, listen, I don't want

you to make an exception for me, but I'm going to ask anyways. That's because you're the plus one.

That's true. At this P at this point, it's her meet and greet. Okay. She keeps you out of trouble,

bro. Not only do I, the only trouble I get into at Twitch cons is that I go too hard on the,

on the event. Like I go, I'm just not enough sleep and I do it. She's literally going to keep me

from doing that. Otherwise, literally when I get done with Twitch con, I go out for dinner,

do whatever. Then I go home. I take a shower. Uh, I FaceTime my kids and then, um, I either go to

bed or do like an IRL.

And then go to sleep and get up at Twitch con. Like I am like the, the, the, the least worrisome

person to, to be at a Twitch. The only thing she has to worry about is me like, you know,

going until my heart stops. Other than that, like I'm that guy who's like, I'm everywhere and I'm

involved in everything. But like, even the people that are at Twitch con, not that anybody would

ever want to, you know, whatever with me, but even they look at me and they don't even bother

because they're like, nah, he's not, he's not, he's not even worth it. Like when BB said, uh,

uh, stock, he's a very safe guy. I'm like, that's a compliment.

It is. I'll take that. Um, all right. Uh, are you going to wear the cardboard sign again? I

might. That was actually a lot of fun. Every Twitch con produces an insane stock guy clip.

Well, I, all my clips now kind of happen on other people's stream. Cause I don't, I, I having more

fun IRL and other people's streams, but all of my most watched clips of all time were, were from

Twitch con Trump. Not, not doing this thing today. What happened to your shelves? Did you sell all

the stuff? No, no. I just separating what I'm taking with me and what I'm not.

For example, I don't know what happened with hut and Sue, but ever since they did the, the, the

merger thing with American Bitcoin or whatever, they, they just kind of like, don't really,

Holy shit. This TDIC thing is going nuts. We don't really, I don't really hear from them much.

So, but they sent me something before, like, this is one of those things where I have it,

but I'm not going to keep it. So I should give it away in commemoration of them. We're, uh, you

know, partnering or merging with, you know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't

know. But they sent me a hat and so like, but I don't, I don't wear hats anymore. So like I should

do a giveaway or something. Otherwise I'll just donate it with all my other hats.

The one thing I made sure to keep is the, uh, all the Christmas cards and birthday cards and just

nice cards. You guys have sent me, I've kept those for sure. Um, the stuff I got sent to me

from the beginning. Um, I've kept, um, I finally got my play button, but I don't know if I should

send it to Delaware or wait till I get up there. The problem is I'm about to fall under a hundred

thousand subs again. So I better, I better, I better, uh, order it soon. Uh, long time viewer

here. Do you know what made gold and silver jump so much from Friday? Yeah. Uh, uncertainty with,

uh, the China trade war. Are we getting a new PO box in Delaware? Probably because I'm going to

keep my business address down here. So I'll do a PO box there. The problem with the PO boxes is

that I have to remember to go get stuff. And if people don't tell me to go get stuff, I just leave

it there and it gets sent back. Yeah. We rented, we, we, we rented out for six months up there

and we're staying just North of Wilmington. And I, we don't want to be in Claymont because that

was like not a fun area that we stayed in when we were, um, uh, doing a Airbnb up there, but it's

in like a quiet area and it's near the coast. So it's not really bad. And it gives us access to,

to, to the airport in Philadelphia, which is pretty close. Uh, I want to go, I want to, if we

buy, if we decide to stay up there and the weather doesn't crush me, I want to stay up in Hokanson.

That's where I want to go. I want to stay up there. I want to stay up there. I want to stay up there.

We went up there for the 4th of July and it had a really nice feel to it. Um, and, but my wife

wants to be in Newcastle, which I think is a bad idea because it's just, okay. You crazy? Oh, okay.

I'm crazy now. Apparently we spent all that fucking time wanting to buy in Newcastle and rent

Newcastle, but now I'm fucking crazy. Okay. Huh? Newcastle was just the first year. Hokanson.

It's Hokanson. Don't say Hakason. Okay. Hak-tua. Okay. I said Hakason one time and somebody who's

actually the one guy that lives in Hokason, Hokason,

that has internet was like, that's not how you say it, Stalky. It's Hokason. Okay. And I'm like,

I'm sorry, dude. That was me, but I don't live there. Solo trip to Scotland to see castles.

Nah, best I can do is Newcastle. Why are you thinking of moving to Delaware? Try to pronounce

Worcester. What's wrong with Worcester? It's not Worcester. W, no, not Warshire sauce.

Warshester. He said W-O-R-C-E-S-T-E-R. I pronounce that as Worser. I mean, Warshester would be

how you pronounce it, but somebody local would probably call it Worcester.

Ever seen those videos of a praying mantis male? Guys, y'all gonna have to chill with that. No blurbs

today when we have our thing. Okay. It's just, you know, not everybody ready for that. Okay.

Cause you could see his, he's smiling. He's like worth it. That must be some good mantis

sussy or something. I'm gonna check my email and see if I got a cancellation yet. Nope. Not yet.

Okay. Oh, what are the topics? Oh, lame. I'm just tripped up for 11 months. Am I what?

You type like you're lifting weights. No, I was reading like three things at one time.

Got a lot of fucking, a lot of stress right now with this move. Holy shit.

I sent you a DM on Twitch where Trump, Trump, Trump is talking. Has he talked yet?

Foggy underscore C just resubbed for 56 months. I'll miss this place. So many good memories.

Have you tried not being stressed? Bro, I want you to imagine that all of a sudden

your fucking monthly expense about to go up by between five and 7,000 a month and be like,

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

Yeah. Nothing to worry about there, bro. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like thinking about this.

I'm like, bro, am I going to have to like, uh, should I just sell this house for kids renting

it? Maybe you should sell us out a bit more. I'm not going to sell you out, but I'm doing one,

I'm doing one sponsorship coming up with a company, uh, that does futures trading,

but it's, it's similar to like the prop firm, not the same, but similar with, uh, with, with,

you know, the way it is, but it's a legit company, but they, they, they allow futures and I want to

practice. So I'm doing one where I get to practice futures on stream and people started DMing me.

Oh, this is the end. Oh, you, this, I'm like, bro, this isn't some fucking shady fucking little

company where I'm out here. Like it's like, it's like a company that, that has those, the tiered

levels and has the profit thing. And like, but they let you do future. I want to try it with my

little lines. People lose their mind. They think they, they don't see past what it is and they just

get this idea in their mind. But I might have to turn down, um, I might have to turn down my, um,

my, uh, Coinbase sponsorship. Uh, I haven't decided yet, but, uh, they're, they have a new

product out that, that, that, that they, they wanted me to look through and look at. And I was

kind of cool with it, but I really just don't understand it. So I want to kind of learn more

about it and then decide if I want to do it or not. Um, how much did they pay you to abandon

your morals? Can you name one moral I abandoned? The UN thinks we are joking about our threat,

Stocky. Um, you should do more sponsors. To be honest, I never see you do any. I do some.

No, I have to turn down about 90%.

Of my sponsors. I, um, I, uh, I can't, I can't, if it's something that I always said,

I will only do a sponsorship. It's something either. I, I either, uh, I either a have used

B would use C think is a viable option or something people could be interested in.

And if it's something I haven't used or I don't, you know, I haven't used before. I want to look

at it and then show people as an option. And then I have to make sure that everything about it's

legit. And that's on top of that. So like, I'm very, very picky. Like even my, um,

even my agent is like, I asked him, I said, anything new come in in the past week or so?

He's like, yeah, but you wouldn't want any of them. I'm like, okay, that's fine.

What happened to Manscaped? That was only a one month thing. How much is Rokana paying you?

You think I'm getting paid? Oh, it's a first time chatter. They're trolling. Okay. I thought I was,

I was like during the fricking DN, the, the, the, the, the election, the D the DNC paid

streamers a lot of money to, to, to, to host things. I had,

I had the opportunity to host somebody. And I said, I am not, there was no way I was taking

any money. Literally was like, I cannot take any money. They didn't, they, they knew my agent,

let them know, but there was no way. Cause the problem is once you take money from somebody,

you don't have the ability to ask, to talk to them. And on top of that, you know, I don't,

that's not how I operate. And so I've had, I had AOC one time I had Brian Dees on. Um,

and I've offered, I've, I've, I've reached out to a lot of Republican people too, but they just,

they just never come on. And I think it's because of the, the, the way, uh, Twitch is. So, uh,

no, uh, first time chatter. If you're not trolling, uh, I don't get paid for these things.

I have not, and, uh, never will get paid from a political party, uh, or somebody, uh, coming on

for a sponsor to push their narrative. Never have never will continue to go up in the short term.

Nick took money from Kamala Harris. I actually was supposed to have, uh, Harris on, and then they,

uh, they, they, they pulled out at the last second, but Brian Dees was actually really cool

because, you know, regardless of if somebody has an R or a D next to their name, if they

understand economics, they're going to be able to do it. So, uh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

or there's somebody who actually is involved in the process of it. It's a good talk to have with

them. Um, and I tell all of the people I'm on too. I I'm not going to do political slanting,

right? Like this isn't your election can't reelection campaign, right? You're not going

to come onto my stream and, and, and, and, and, you know, do that. Like if you want to talk about

these things and I want to talk about these things, let's do it, but we're not going to spend

time like doing a fucking like, Oh, they, they, they, they, this, and the way, well, this person

and that, but it's like, Hey, listen, let's talk about the ideas, what you're doing, how it's

involved in what it does.

And how they actually works in, in, in this, right? Like I'm very clear with that. And, um,

you know, obviously politicians are always going to say things in their light because that's what

they do. But like, I make sure it's the narrative. There is no narrative. It's it's, here's what

we're going to talk about. And people are really, really good about that. Um, I've had politicians

and other people turned down, uh, coming on here because I'm very, very, just like very blunt with

that. Um, I, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to be told what I can and can't say, or what I can and

can't ask.

I always understand if there's something personal people don't want to talk about,

or if there's like a specific touchy subject, I'm, I'm willing to not, you know, in, in whatever that,

but like, as far as being told what questions to ask or what I have to do, I just turn it down.

It just absolutely turned it down.

No narrative, only a script. You think I have a script? Have you ever seen my stream?

What's the benefit for Roe to come on? What's the benefit of having a sitting member of Congress

who a literally studied and taught economics,

before he became a Senator B somebody who is, uh, you know, involved in a lot of major

bills right now, including the whole stop trading thing among, you know, uh, uh, you know,

Congress, uh, the Epstein file release also somebody who's on the committee for China and

was just in China who could talk about tariffs, talk about how the budget's working. How about

they're doing like, like, like what is, tell me what the downside of having that person on and

asking them questions.

Is like, I'm, I'm so confused. Like what is the downside? Like, Hey, I don't agree with this person

on politics, but they have knowledge of something. I don't, I don't want to know that knowledge

because it's not coming from somebody who fits my narrative. Therefore, anything they say is

completely, you know, irrelevant. No, you're the type of person who sits at home and go,

hell yeah, brother fucking God damn right. Or, Oh my God, the fucking, they're trying to kill

our babies and cut off our dinner. Like, what are you, what are you doing? Broaden your horizon,

talk to people.

You got to stop pigeonholing yourself. Even if you disagree with somebody, if there's somebody

who makes decisions and has inside knowledge on, on, on the operations of things, you should

probably find out from them. I mean, if you don't want to, that's fine. I'm not going to force you

to stay here, but you could probably learn something. Uh, people are too soft. No, they're

just, they're just not used to it. I don't care what somebody's, uh, political ideology is. If

they're coming on this stream and they're willing to talk to us and have a conversation about these

important issues.

100% I'm going to have them on 100%. The problem is, and this isn't me trying to, to, to, to make a

statement. It's just the truth. People from the Republican party don't come on here.

Now I understand why people from the Republican party are very, very cautious of coming on Twitch

because all of the news and the headlines and all this stuff that's coming out from Twitch around

politics is obviously in the headlines is something that people that are Republican are probably going

to want to avoid. So I get that part.

But I, I invite everybody and you know, I'm more, I had Thomas Massey, who's literally the co-sponsor

with Ro Khanna on two different bills, invited him, but his people said, no, they didn't want to come

on. And it's like, okay, I can't force people to. So it's not about me pushing a narrative. It's just

whoever says yes is who comes on. Okay. We got to run marbles and then, um, see what Trump has to

say. If, uh, if, if, if he, if he doesn't black out and then we got to talk about a few more

things. TDIC is still going, um, waiting for stuff to get another run here. We're doing pretty good

today.

Pretty damn good today. Good. Goodbye. The dip. Make sure you guys are buying the dips and selling

the rips. Okay. Um, make sure that if you guys do have any questions for, um, uh, uh, for Congressman

Khanna that you put it in the ask questions for him in the discord channel. Uh, I'm not going to

answer your dumb questions or ask them, but if we have time, I'd like to hop into a couple of

y'all's questions. Uh, he seems pretty open about the conversations. So for those of you guys who

don't know, we're going to be talking about, um, the debt, the budget, um, tariffs, what's going

on with that, uh, congressional trading and, and, and, you know, what's going on with all that.

And then the Epstein files, because you guys can't get enough of that shit. And he co-introduced the

bill for it. So I figure why not? What does Roe get from this? Man, you on one today. I would

assume that, uh, being that it's become a independent media world that if you want to be

relevant and you want to be seen and you want to reach new audiences, you have to go this route.

And I feel like more and more politicians are doing that. So I feel like by talking about these

things, they get, they get more reach because remember the boomers that voted for all the

people that are in office are dying off and you gotta get the, you gotta get in front of the next

generation. So if, if you're a politician, you need to be on these things in order to, to, to

get out there. One thing I will give this guy respect is this guy is, I got to ask him about

this. He's all over social media.

And he gets fucking flamed. Not like me. I get flamed differently. It is just constant,

like kind of like with, with AOC or with like, um, some of these other guys, they're getting

flamed online. I don't know how they have the fortitude. Like you just post something and

they just don't read it. Like, I don't know how you deal with that. Not wrong. Twitch is one of

the last places where you can reach people on both political sides. Yeah. I'm not, again,

I am not here to you. I don't know why I have to say, I don't have to fucking say this.

If you think that I, if I have some kind of, uh, uh, narrative or something, uh, you know,

underlying intentions with having these events, you're, you're, you're actually brain dead.

I can't help you. I'm not stupid. I know a politician wants to come out to reach a new

audience, but if they want to be in front of a new audience and I want to learn something or

get something from them and have a, have an interview or questions from them, that's called

reciprocal. It's going to be it. I'm not going to fucking say, Hey, donate here or Hey, vote for

this person. I fuck all that shit. You ain't you in the wrong channel. If you think that's coming

from me. Um, did you brief him on questions? No, we just went over a couple of topics.

Do you think he owns gold? I mean, I don't know. I would assume that if he's got, you know,

if he's diversified, he's got it. Will there be able to hear blurbs? We're not having blurbs on.

I, there's no way in, in this, on this planet that you guys are going to have blurbs available.

That is absolutely insane that you even think that I would let blurbs happen there. You guys,

you absolutely need help. If you think that I am going to keep blurbs on, there is just,

I got to have mercy on your soul. If you're somebody who believes that I'm going to leave

that shit on. So you're saying there's a chance. No.

Uh, speaking of discord, am I supposed to have two people, uh, DM me under your name after I

join? They're not under my name. Go back and read it. I guarantee it's misspelled somewhere.

Anytime you join a discord, especially a large discord, there's always going to be people who

try to make or bots that make fake accounts and try to catch you up and stuff. I will never DM

you. It's not because I don't like you. I mean, I may not like you, but it's because I physically

can't, or I, I can't, I, they don't allow me to add new people. So it's a scam. It,

the best thing you can do is, is realize that the streamer is not reaching out to you.

And number two, put the settings that say only accept invites or messages from people you share

a discord server with so that you never have to worry about that. It's definitely because he

doesn't like you. That's not true at all. Denying the guests of the complete immersion of the stream,

leaving out blurbs. No, you're not going to gaslight me, bro. You're not going to gaslight

me. All right. IONQ was our main play today. Absolutely beautiful. I don't know what TDIC

is. It's working. Stub is our secondary play. Still up on it. Not sure what to do with it here.

Then the other one was, uh, Beyond was a fucking banger this morning. I, that almost didn't work

out though. Like I got, I got a little concerned there for a while. I thought, okay, this, I might

have effed up here, but I guess I'm okay. You, you, you, my darling angel, man. That was, that's

a wild one. That's that, that's like a community one we've been in for a while. Happy to see it

coming back to life. Not because I'm happy that you guys are doing well, because I don't want to

see you guys get wrecked. All right. I think I'm gonna let the last of my fly go here. We're gonna

run marbles here in a second, but we're up, uh, we're still up, I think 200% on fly. All right.

100%. How far do you think NNE and UUU will go? I mean, UUU is more legitimate than NNE,

especially after last week, we talked about all the positive bullish news that came out for, uh,

for, for UUU. Are you still on MLTX? Yeah. Why? I'm hoping that kid gets his, uh, tuition paid

for off of that, which is fucked up that we live in a, we live in a society. Okay. Let's run marbles

and then we're going to come back and we're going to see if this, uh, Trump press thing happens.

And then we are going to, um, have, uh, have the Congressman come on and we're going to talk. We

only have a limited time.

I think, yeah, we talked about EOSC this morning. Uh, there was news this morning about, um,

new report coming out saying that they're expecting a, uh, uh, what was it? Uh, quadruple,

uh, the, the energy needed, uh, on the planet in the next 10 years for, uh, for, for data centers

and whatnot. And, uh, they're saying that AI data centers will quadruple global power demand

the next 10 years. And EOSC got a, a lot of, uh, is getting a lot of, um, coverage because of that

for battery storage, obviously Tesla, but they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,

okay.

Let's get it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Marbles getting, getting, getting, getting,

get in, get in. Congratulations again to salad tosser for your W early this morning. Uh, but

let's go, let's go, let's go. We got a, uh, got to get going. Are you streaming it all on Thursday

before Twitch con? Oh no, no. I have to leave the house at like 6.00 AM to get on the flight

to San Diego. I'm up over 500% on you now. Hey, yo. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Everybody get in.

It's time to do this.

All right.

Let's do a mashup to piss some people off, and then we'll go.

I'm trying to think if there's a mashup I haven't played that would upset you guys.

I feel like I've upset you guys with everything.

There's always more to upset more people.

All right.

Let's go.

Everybody in?

Is everybody in now?

Are we good?

All right.

Let's go.

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

They want shady.

I'm chopped liver.

Well, if you want shady, this is what I give you.

A little bit of me mixed with some hard liquor.

Some vodka that'll jump.

Start my heart quicker than a shock when I get shot.

At the hospital, by the doctor, when I'm not cooperating.

When I'm rocking the table while it's hot, Miss Chaney, but your husband's heart problem's

complicating, so the FCC won't let me be.

Well, let me be me, so let me see.

They try to shut me down on MTV.

But it's not.

It feels so empty without.

So come on, let's jump back.

Because this is about to get heavy.

I think my favorite thing is how uncomfortable it makes some of you that you like it.

Look at this little controversy, controversy, because it feels so empty.

I'm feeling like prison is helpless until someone comes along on a mission and yells

bitch.

A visionary vision is scary.

We start a revolution, pollute, and the airwaves are rebel.

So just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass.

Congratulations to Tasty Beef.

Curtains.

Damn it, Daniela.

Do not hands up him.

Attention.

Please feel the tension.

Soon as someone mentions me.

Can you explain what that means?

All right.

I posted the song in chat if you want to.

Controversy.

Cause it feels.

Task it.

I go tipper-tap with Danny.

Who's talking this and that?

Chris Kirkpatrick.

You can get your ass kicked worse than a little Limp Bizkit bastard.

It's kind of a banger, though.

You could get stoned.

36-year-old.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

You could get stoned.

Why did somebody send me this?

Eight signs of a weak man?

I've been in a hole ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol.

But sometimes, man, it just seems everybody only wants to disgust me.

So this must mean I'm disgusting, but it's just me.

I'm just a scene.

Why should we max our 401K?

Though I'm not the first king of the world.

Because unfortunately we live in a world where if you don't invest your money.

At all.

and, and, and you're not born into a hedge fund or sorry, um, uh, what do you call it? A, a trust

fund. And you don't somehow win the lottery or start a business. You have to do that. You have

to invest your money. It's the only way you have a chance of, of, of having some part of your life

where you're not working. That's, that's literally, unfortunately the truth. If you don't invest your

money, you, you, you're not going to get there. That's just the unfortunate truth that we're in.

I don't like it. It's not nice. It doesn't feel good, but that you can't hide from the truth.

So if you don't invest your money, okay, you are not going to get there. And anyone who tells you

that investing your money in the stock market is just gambling and stuff like that is an idiot.

Okay. Gambling is, is, is betting against the house. No, the stock market is rigged in

your favor. If you just get out of your own way, dollar cost average, it'll buy the tops

and the dips and the rates. Well, what if the stock market goes down one day, it doesn't come

back up. Well, you got bigger things to worry about than your 401k. So, so why, why even care?

That's just how it is. Okay. Okay. The, the, the, the next crisis that no one's talking about

is the retirement crisis. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put it to you this way. All right.

We have a retirement crisis crisis coming. Okay. And nobody's talking about it.

Because nobody wants to talk about it. Why? Because we're supposed to spend,

we're supposed to be a consumer, you know, little piggies, 30% of the world's consumer

consumerism comes from the United States, even though we only make up, you know, what 5% of the

world's population. So let me, this, this is the median 401k balance by age. Okay. And this is

considering stocks are at an all time high and people who've been in, you know, for 20, 30 years,

should be up hundreds and hundreds of percent. Okay. All right. At the end of last year,

the median overall 401k balance was $38,000. Okay. Under age 25. Okay. The median 401k balance last

year. Okay. Was $1,948. Okay. 25 to 34. The median 401k balance was,

$16,255. 35 to 44. Last year ending median balance, $39,958. Age 45 to 54. Your Gen Xers,

$67,796. Age 55 to 64. People that are supposed to be retiring. The median 401k balance at the

end of last year, ending median balance, $39,958. Age 45 to 54. Your Gen Xers, $67,796. Age 55 to 64.

End of last year was $95,642. There is a retirement crisis brewing in this country that no one is

talking about because it's uncomfortable. This is a problem. And for those of you saying, well,

yeah, but it's locked up in home equity. How are you going to tap that? A reverse, a reverse

mortgage. You don't want to live on a reverse mortgage. You're gonna be house poor like crazy

until you lose your house. Okay. This is, this is a very big problem. And this is,

what concerns me the most. We have 13,000 people a day turning 65 right now. So when you think

boomers have all the money. Yeah. Yeah. Of course they do. They've been in, they've, they've, they've

owned assets for 40 years, of course, but not all of them. The ones who do have a lot. And a lot of

it's just because they've been in for so long. That's why I tell you, I don't care if it's $10

a month, start investing your money. Because the thing is, is that that money,

it's about time, not about the amount of money. It's about the amount of time. Start now. I don't

care if you are 18 or 38, start adding to it. Add what you can. Give up going out one weekend to the

bar, uh, one night, uh, to the bar a month and save 150 bucks and put that shit in your 401k,

your IRA, HSA. I don't care. Put it in there. Okay. Yeah. But the market's at all time high.

We had 54 all time highs last year. Okay. All those people are still waiting for a dip back

down there. It's not happening. Okay. You have to do that. You have to do that. You have to do that.

You have to do this because every 10 years you wait, you have to five to seven X the amount of

money you put in every month to catch up. It's hard to save your way out of poverty with no

money. That's a defeatist attitude. That's a defeatist attitude. How do you do this? If you're

at, okay, you're in a, you're in a shit situation. You have an uphill fucking battle, but instead of

being a victim, you use it as motivation. Okay. That's what it is. I've always said this. You

hear people with cancer call themselves a victim of cancer. No, they call themselves a fighter or

a survivor. Okay. You have to get rid of that because here's the thing. Yeah. But that's easy

for you to say. You don't know what it's like. Really? And I'm not saying everyone's going to

have a journey. Some people have it way more difficult, but the mindset around, I have to

give up or I, it won't happen for me because of X, Y, Z means you've already given up and you

will never get out of it. You will never get there. Okay.

Oh yeah. But you're just, you don't understand. This isn't about understanding.

If you lay over, if you roll over and give up because you feel like that, guess what?

Then you're right. It's over. You've given up. But if you want a chance at it, you have to look

past that and say, okay, I have been dealt a shit hand. I am in a shit situation. Life fucking

sucks. This isn't fair. And you're right. It absolutely is not fair, but you can not get

that victim mentality. I understand that that sounds like I'm being very brash, but that's how

I have to speak to people nowadays. Okay. Okay. If you see somebody who is, is, is, is severely

overweight and they're in a bad situation. Okay. And they say, well, look at these people running.

I'll never be able to run 30 miles. Look at me, whatever. It's like, bro, just, just, just, just

stand up and walk to the front door every hour. And then next week, walk to the mailbox and then

walk down the street little by little by little by little. You may never be able to run there,

but you're not going to, if you don't give it a shot.

You know what I mean? Like it's the same kind of thing. I understand. And it sounds,

it's easy for me to just play into it and tell you, oh, you're, you know, you're, you're this,

these people are holding you back, or this is a reason why you're not where you want to be.

Maybe that, that, that, that is part of the reason, but you also have a lot to say in your destiny

and you may never get there, but I can guarantee you, you won't. If you just roll over.

Okay. Even if it's a dollar, I don't care. Just start.

It just helps you understand. You know what I mean? But yeah, there is an absolute retirement

crisis in this country that no one's talking about. Okay. And the reason I bring up median

for those who are unaware, median is just basically the middle of the line. Like, right,

like, like, like you take everybody and you kind of find a middle line. The reason I don't use

average is average is skewed, right? The average balance for somebody 65 in this range right now

is about 300,000, but that's because it's skewed heavily to people who really put in a lot.

Okay. Now this also skews. If you go by income, people making a income of 150,000 and up.

Okay. Um, the median, uh, 401k is one 88, which is still pretty low, but less than 15,000.

Okay. Is $3,000. Cause that's obviously small, uh, younger people. Now, if you look at overall

median for males, it's 42,250.

63, this is overall. And for females, it's 31,000. And this is why, you know, you guys think that I'm

simping to the ladies when I talk about this stuff, but no, a lot of women have been, um,

you know, obviously over time it's changing now, but didn't work nearly as much or didn't have

control over the finances or didn't whatever, but there, but it's becoming more of a thing.

And so this is going to rise, but this is, this, this is, this is a lot. I mean,

people don't really understand how messed up we are. Okay.

Now it doesn't get much better with IRAs. Okay. Okay. Median IRA balance for people under 35.

Okay. $18,000. I thought we stopped funding them in the eighties. No, no, no, no wrong IRA.

Okay. My wife just started her Roth at my request because she claims that she is

going to get a state pension. I asked the stocky question. What if they take it away?

You really taking props for that, huh? You're going to hold that over her head. The rest of

her life. You started that because I told you to, do you do stocks? Yeah, we do stocks.

We're, but we do a lot of things, including, you know, IRAs and 401ks are usually stocks, right?

Now, some of you guys will see the median here and actually realize you're doing better than

you thought you were because you're always comparing yourself to other people. A lot of

you guys are doing a lot better. Okay. And it's not here to compare. I don't want you guys to do

comparison. Comparison is a theft of joy. It really is. But understand if you were 24 years

old and you have 2000,

you're above the average. You're above the median. Okay. If you're 35 to four, if you're

under 44 and you have more than 40,000, you're crushing it. Okay. Is 780,000 at 55 good? I mean,

you're doing a lot better than most people. I mean, again, you know, it really depends on a

lot of factors. Like, do you own your home? Um, how aggressive is that? How is it split up into,

into fixed income versus, versus equities? You know, like, uh, you know, do you, do you,

you know, have a business? Do you have other, other sources of secondary income? Is it dividends?

Like there's a lot there. Um, you're not, he's being gentle. $780,000 at age 55, 10 years from

retirement at this point, especially since contributions are going to be able to go up

is not terrible. Okay. At the rate of even 7%, because you guys forget about how compounding

works. Okay. 7% of $800,000. Okay. They're going to add another fucking, you know, $60,000,

this year. Right. And then compound that for another 10 years. That's part of that exponential

cycle. It's not ideal, but being at 788,000 while still contributing, being able to contribute more

pretty soon, because you're going to be getting close to that, that, that, that, uh, part where

you can actually add more and the way compounding works, they're doing okay. Okay. Sitting here and

telling somebody that you know, you're fucking, you're going to die. You're going to work until

you fucking die. Fucking all in on goddamn AEHR weekly.

Right now, or it's over. Like that's stupid, right? Like they can't change where they're at,

but I can tell them that if you own your own home and you, you know, and you, and you still work and

you're still contributing and you have, you know, and your expenses aren't crazy. You can, you could

do okay with that, especially with social security stuff. They still got 10 years. Okay. Plus a lot

of you guys forget that people can move to lower cost living areas. That's what a lot of retirement

people do, right? If they want to. Now, I don't like the idea of retirement, especially

early retirement. I like the idea of retiring from giving a shit. That's kind of what I like.

Like I can still do a part-time work or do something cause I want to, but if somebody

tells me I can't with fuck you, you know what I mean? F you money, not fuck you money, but F you

money, right? Like you, you don't want to retire from something. You want to retire to something.

Um, you know, take some time off, relax or whatever like that, but you want to have a purpose,

whether it's starting a small business or whether it's, you know, you know, doing something online

or whether it's, you know, whatever. Cause the idea that I'm going to go travel, it's going to

drain all your money. I'm going to go fish. It's going to, you know,

whatever I'm going to do this or I'm going to sit and rot and do stuff like that. Then you just

fucking, you know, you just, just rot away mentally. Um, but you know, 700, you guys are

thinking he's retiring today. I want you guys to understand how compounding works, right? Like

this is why a lot of people don't want to, people don't want to invest because they're like, Oh,

I only go up 7% a year and it doesn't look like that much. I want you to look at this real quick

on a compounding calculator. Oh God. Okay. All right. So if you have $788,000 with

10 years to go, right? So $788,000. Okay. Let's say he's contributing, you know, what? Uh,

I don't know. What's what's at 55. How much is the, is the max? Um, still standard. Okay. So

31,000. Um, so let's say he's added, he's putting in, uh, 2,200 a month. Okay. Or 2,100 a month.

Whoops. Okay. Got 10 more years to go. Okay. We'll do 8%, which is on the,

low end right now. It's about 10%, but we'll do 8%. Okay. Shut the fuck up guys.

You guys don't understand how fast that, that compounds. Okay. Compounding calculators look

very flat. And that's why a lot of younger people don't invest because they look at it and say, Oh,

well in 10 years, I'll only be up this much. Once you get to a certain level, the compounding just

picks the fuck up. Okay. How do you get 8%? Well, if he has it, a total market fund, the S and P

about seven to 10% a year right now, it's been averaging more, but let's give it a few years.

Right. Also, if he did his Roth conversion back in April, when I was screaming at people that

were 55 and older to do their Roth conversions, he's probably really set. Cause now he doesn't

pay taxes either. Okay. If you add, if you, if you added this up to, let's say 10% right now,

see, I was trying to talk shit, but if I were talking to someone I cared about and they told

me they had 78,000, I would seriously urge them to adjust their living situation. He said,

it's 788,000. He didn't say 78,000. Can you explain a Roth conversion real quick? Yeah. So

when you get to a certain age, you're going to, you're going to convert your traditional IRA to

a Roth IRA. And so basically what you're doing is, is your, um, uh, you know, you're paying your,

your, your, your, your, your tax on it without penalty and basically transferring it. So you

pay on your, your, your capital gains, right? You're going to pay on the, on the gains of that.

And then you're going to, it's going to, it's going to take the remaining amount and put it

over. So you don't actually lose your shares. You just have to pay the taxes on it and convert it

now that you've paid the taxes. Any additional gains from there are not taxed. And the reason I

told everybody to do that in April was because, um, stocks were down 25%, right? So you're not

losing any of your shares, but your gains are down 25%. So when you do do that conversion,

the amount you owe taxes on is going to be 25% less. You still get to keep all your shares,

move them to your Roth and guess what? 25% discount. And now the gut market is completely

gapped back up. So you end up doing your conversion 25%.

Discount on the taxes paid and you fully gapped up and no taxes on that 10% is too high. Well,

I started with eight. I was telling somebody else, even if you did that all in dollar mean,

all right. IONQ still going TDIC. I don't even know what this is. Um, really good day today.

Really good day today. So if I'm 26 with like 11,000 in my Roth and I could do it 500 a month,

I should have 14 million. What the fuck you miss cipher again. So if you have 11,000,

I'm going to help you out, bro. You have 11,000 in your,

your account. Okay. All right. You're 26 and you're telling you whoops. And you're saying

that you put 500 a month. Okay. 8%. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. Length of years. You're 26. So what? Um,

39. I'm not sure where you got 14 million from, but yes, I feel like a zero might be missing

or you might've added a zero. I got to turn off blurbs.

Stucky changed. Chucky's a sellout. He won't let me put horrible shit on when I'm, when we're,

when we're, when we're talking to somebody. All right. What a day, huh?

Anonymous. Thank you for gifting 20 subs. Um, thank you for gifting one to, uh,

Augustin Gnomes D, um, anal, no, astral pet, petricor, Baker man, Sean's kill,

Um, all right. Did you clear off your shelves in the background for the interview? No, I'm moving.

I'm, I'm moving. Uh, if you guys forgot, I am, uh, I am moving, um, to, uh, to, uh, to, to Delaware.

Okay.

What the fuck is a Delaware? It's a state. It was fun, guys. Guys, I'm not leaving. I'm not ending.

I'm not quitting streaming.

Um, bonk. More like Delaware. Okay, bro. Java, stop crying. You've been crying all morning

about the move. It's not like we're family moving and you're gonna miss all your friends.

I'm just, I'm just, I'm gonna have a bigger room than I'm overpaying for.

Invest in your 401k. My final message. Goodbye. I'm not going. I'm not leaving you.

Thanks for the few years of signal services. Be nice to Java right now. She's fragile. Okay.

Can I have your old underwear? No. There's at least 48 other states you could have picked.

Call Java. She's crying. No. It was nice to have you. I'm not going. Will you still come to my

wedding even if you vanish? I already told you I'll go to your guys' wedding if you pay for it.

My wife won't let me go otherwise. Just one more signal for old times? No.

For 53 months. Last stream stock hug. Are you getting front page for this? Is your partner

manager hooking you up? I mean, if they want to, they're welcome to. I don't, I don't ask them to

do anything. I never thought this day would come. Yeah. State tax is going to be, uh, higher in

Delaware. I'm actually leaving my business in Florida. It's actually more business friendly

to stay in Florida right now. Okay. Um, I'm going to give you guys a 30 second marbles. We're going

to run an ad now so we can hopefully clear it for, for the, for the, for the, for the, uh, uh,

thing. He's coming on five minutes. Okay. So let's get you started. I'm going to give you a 30 second

marbles game and then, um, we'll run an ad during marbles as well so that I can, uh, make sure that

you guys don't get, uh, uh, miss anything from this. It's going to be a great interview. Uh,

hopefully everything goes well. Um, it was a fun 50 months. Good stuff we're going to talk about

today. Okay. All right. All right. Let's go real quick marbles, real quick marbles. So everybody

can get ready and we're going to run more, uh, an ad during it. So that way we can get rid of the

ads. Is it Channing Tatum? No. I still can't believe Channing Tatum follows me on Instagram.

Why?

It's not, this isn't a finale stream. It's not my last guest. This is not my last stream and it's

not my last guest. Oh my God. Get in. All right. Get in guys. Hurry up. We got, we got four minutes,

four minutes, four minutes. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

All right guys. Three minutes. Let's go. This is not the final stream.

Thanks for the EHR, EHR, uh, signal earlier. No. All right. We're going straight into it. Let's go.

This isn't sad music guys. It's not a final stream song. Tomorrow I'll hopefully be free

of this bug forever. Did you just call me a bug? I'm not leaving tomorrow. Damn Java.

All right. Where do I, where's my ad thing at? Oh, I can't run an ad. Oh crap. All right, go.

Who am I going to watch now? I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even leaving for like a month.

Please tell me you're getting a new PC. Soon.

I think. Do we get the channel? I'm not going anywhere. You guys are DJs. All right. Blurps

are off. Okay. I'm not letting you guys, you guys are not doing blurps. Okay. I'm sorry,

but it's not happening. Okay. Don't cry. Cause it's over. Be happy. It happened guys. I'm not

going anywhere. I'm not even, I'm not even like, like I'm going to miss two days of stream. I'm

driving up on Sunday and Monday. I should be back on Tuesday that of that week. What are you talking

about? All right. Let me turn off my camera so I can do this right. Cause last time I did it wrong.

Let me make sure I turn off my, um,

my, my, my, my, my, um, face cam. All right. Make sure I do this right this time

because last time I did it wrong and you guys laughed at me. So I gotten better at it. Okay.

All right. Let's see. Let's see if I get it right this time. All right. We got it working first

time. All right. Oh, welcome. Thank you so much for, uh, for taking the time to, to, to come on.

I think a lot of people were actually excited for this. That's great. I know you as the stock guy,

what's your name? Uh, well, my name is Jason. I, I, I don't really use it.

Uh, much because, uh, it's just a weird with, uh, with the way the stream goes to have your first

name. All right. So I should just call you Jason, call you the stock guy from whatever, whatever,

whatever's comfortable for you. Because, uh, honestly it, uh, it's, this is more about you

than it is about me. We just really wanted to, to, to, to get to talk to you. So for those who

don't know, um, uh, do you, is it, do you prefer, uh, uh, is it Kana correct? Yeah, but you can call

me brother. Okay. All right. My wife, like I said, my wife's Punjabi. So she corrected me. She said,

that's not how you pronounce it. I said, that's, that's not how you pronounce it. I said, that's

if that's what he says by, that's what I go by. Um, all right. So, uh, you know, you and I actually

had a little of an exchange on Twitter and that's how we got to know each other and, and, and was

like, okay, well, how about we hop on this call and, and, and talk some, you know, you know, nuts

and bolts about, uh, some of these issues because, uh, you know, I think my audience likes to hear

directly from, you know, the source about a lot of things that are going on and, um, yeah, I'm

looking forward to it. So if you're a Punjabi wife, I'm just, I, I, I,

follow your stuff on social and looking forward to the conversation.

Yeah. I, I'm going to need some tips after stream, uh, to, to help me out with that one. Uh, but if

you'd like to introduce yourself, uh, and like some of your background, it'd be great because,

uh, you know, these guys would love to hear about it. Well, I'm a Rokana and my parents are

immigrants from India. My grandfather spent four years in jail as part of Gandhi's independence

movement, fighting for India's independence. That's what inspired me. My parents came here

in the 1960s. Uh,

I was born in Philadelphia, uh, our bicentenary in 1976, grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,

a tough loss for the Phillies to the Dodgers recently. It was, uh, hopeful for that. Uh,

and then after school moved out to Silicon Valley and now represent Silicon Valley in Congress.

It's an extraordinary district, Apple, Google, uh, and Tesla, Broadcom, NVIDIA, all in my district,

probably the wealthiest district in the world and leading the AI revolution.

And I've been following the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh,

the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh,

and that is that we've got to tackle the economic divides that are tearing this country apart.

We need to figure out how do we make the economic success of regions that were left out of

globalization and families that aren't getting a fair shake, our highest priority. Uh, we should

be taxing some of the billionaires in my district so we can provide childcare, education, healthcare

housing, uh, for Americans. And we've got to create economic activity and job opportunities

in every part of the country. So that's been,

in a nutshell, what I stand for. Do you find that there's any conflict or of interest or like

difficulties for you being that you represent some of the, like you said, the, the, the, the

region that all of these major corporations are out of. And yet, you know, this is something that

you're kind of focusing on, but that's your biggest hurdle. Like, how do you, how do you

manage that? Every day there's tension. I mean, that's the biggest tension because I represent

this extraordinary wealthy area of technology. And I say, look, I'm for innovation that three

people who got the Nobel prize today in economics all talked about how innovation technology leads

to economic growth, how culture needs to be open to new ideas to have economic growth. So I

obviously believe in innovation and technology, but I think that the fundamental problem in the

country is income inequality and the economic divides. So for example, I'm for a billionaire

tax and a tax on people over a hundred million. And that's something that people in Silicon Valley

don't agree with. But, you know, I, I say, if we don't have this, you're not going to,

you know, be able to support health care and childcare and jobs for people. I call it the

anti-revolution tax. Another area is I've championed the internet bill of rights. I think

it's, it's crazy that these social media companies can get all the data on us and then have algorithms

that make us hate each other. So there, there are places that there's obviously tension, but I

fundamentally believe that we need to have investment in communities from these technology

companies to create,

the tech trades, the next generation of jobs. And we can't just wish away the modern economy.

It's not going anywhere. Anywhere. We need to figure out how do we get people participating and

succeeding in that economy.

On the, on the billionaire tax that you were talking about, I hear a lot about the, the

billionaire tax and, and, and, and I understand a lot of where that's coming from. And I'm often a

person who says, you know, if you want to tax them, it's good, but you have to also get your

spending under order because if you tax them and you don't cut spending, you really kind of,

you know, defeat the purpose. But one thing that I'm often very vocal about is, is just putting a

tax on them. You know, it seems like the, with the way Congress moves, that's almost never going to

happen. And even if you do like an income tax, there's ways of doing it. Why do we never really

hear about the loopholes? Like for example, the borrowing against equities at, you know,

which is not taxable or the, the, the, the grant, um, uh, you know, trusts where people are allowed

to do the annuity to pass it on. Like, I feel like, why is it? We never hear about the action.

Things that could actually get where that money's going as opposed to just the,

the raise taxes or put a tax. I think both are absolutely correct. I've called for actually

taxing is a realized, realized event when someone borrows against their estate. So,

you know, what happens is you're a billionaire, you borrow a 10 million, 50 million dollars

from the bank. The bank lends it to you because you have all these assets and then you live off

that and you never have realized income. And I've said, when you borrow, that should be realized

income. Uh,

and you should be taxed on that. And that, that, that should be a realization event. And that's

something that we could get past. I also think we need to have a step up in basis when you,

uh, set, give money to your kids, right? Like, so you give Facebook's, you buy Facebook stock.

Uh, it's worth a dollar. It goes up to a hundred dollars and then you give it to your kids. Well,

they, when they get it after your death, they, they don't have to pay the capital appreciation

from one to a hundred dollars. They just get it at a hundred bucks. Well, no one paid the capital

appreciation. That's not fair. So I have to say, I don't think that's a good idea. I don't think

step up in basis. So there are technical fixes that could raise more revenue. But I think when

people say a wealth tax, let's get two to 3% on these billionaires or people over a hundred

million, it's just expressing the anger that, uh, that they're not paying enough tax, the details

of it. We can talk about the concrete ideas too, of which you mentioned. Yeah. Uh, actually speaking

of which from your district, uh, Nvidia CEO, very famous for doing that for his kids. He's used the

grant as a way of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

of basically giving his children, I think what, what seven saving $7 billion worth of paying taxes

because he used that loophole. So he was able to put what exactly is the grant. So that's,

that's not the capital gains step up in basis. Explain to me what, so it's, it's basically a way

that, that, that you could take assets, put them into a trust pays out an annuity. You, as long as

you keep it, you know, uh, up to the, the, the IRS tax level. And then the original amount you put

in goes back to the, to the, to the benefit or to the person who put it in the beneficiary then

gets to keep the rest of the remaining tax-free. They don't pay any tax on it. Okay. Outside of

whatever the IRS tax rate is a 7% or whatever. Uh, outside of that, there is no, there's no

inheritance tax. There's nothing like that. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a loophole to close that

loophole and it's called a grant. Yeah. It's a grant. So it's, uh, uh, the, the exact, um,

I'm going to look it up after this. Cause I think that, you know, I've talked about the step up in

basis and I've talked about the realization, but I think, uh, uh, after this, I'm going to look it

up and I look, I know, uh, Jensen Wong is a, and he's obviously a great immigrant entrepreneurial

story, but he should pay tax on that money. I mean, that, that, that, and there should be an

inheritance tax. That's, that's the way the system is set up. That doesn't mean he didn't do a great

company and we don't want his company to succeed. And that's why I call myself a progressive

capitalist, which is I have no problem with Jensen Wong. I have no problem with him becoming a

billionaire.

I have no problem giving money to his kids and his grandkids and setting his family up for

generations. And he can do that while paying a wealth tax. And, and, and, and the old saying

is don't hate the player, hate the game, right? It's like, he's just using the system. So the

way that the, like I said, the, the, the grant or retained annuity trust, the grant, this is kind of

something we're seeing how so much of the wealth that, you know, we raise estate taxes, we do all

this, but it doesn't seem to have an effect because there's loopholes like this, where

you can legitimately put these things in, pay a small amount,

get the annuity, get the retained back, and then you're inherited. You don't pay anything. So I

think, I think his not to put him on blast, but it's just because he has the biggest one. I think

his kids are going to save out on seven to $10 billion in taxes paid because of Nvidia stock

since then. So I just thought that was something interesting. Cause again, I like to hear you seem

to be doing it with a lot of your bills about like, you know, actionable things rather than just

this, you know, put out this.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

Yeah. I'm going to look up this grant for a returning annuity trust because I, I honestly hadn't studied them.

things on the step up of the basis. But there are a bunch of these things we can do to increase

revenue. Now, you said, what about the spending side? First of all, it's important to understand

that we are a low tax country. I know that sounds defiant to political rhetoric, but in the OECD,

which is basically all the European countries and Western democracies, we are number two in the

lowest tax place. We don't tax wealth nearly where other countries do. So we can increase

those taxes with some of the ideas you've been saying, but we can also decrease spending. Where

can we decrease spending? We don't need a one over a trillion dollar Pentagon budget, 56% of defense

for a legacy industry when a lot of the fighting in Ukraine and the fighting in the Pacific is

going to be need a credible drones and submarines and autonomous vehicles and

and

and

and

we have a legacy industry which is going to defense contractors. Musk actually disrupted it with

SpaceX, with Lockheed and Boeing. We can disrupt a lot more of the Pentagon, lower spending there.

We can eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. The Medicare advantage is ripping off the American

people. They basically are saying people are sicker than they are and they're charging billions. Not

just me, it's documented and conservatives talk about this as well. Those are three places that

we can cut spending. There are a lot of duplicative agencies, but I think it's important to

I put out a plan for people who want to Google it that lowers the debt by $12 trillion over 10 years. It brings the deficits down under four percent of GDP, where we need to be on peacetime. And it has very specific revenue increases through taxes and spending cuts. People can disagree with it, but I feel like every member of Congress of the 435 should put out their plan of how they're going to actually get the math to work.

Yeah. And you were just touching on health care. One.

Yeah.

One.

One thing, like I'm one of those people where even if I disagree with a politician or a party or anything like that, I like to make sure that I'm critical of what they're doing wrong, but also not blind to potential positive things that have happened.

And one of the positive things I would say that has come out a little bit is the talk around PBMs and how they've affected this.

And I feel like that was a dark shadow no one knew about for a long time.

And recently we're getting more, it's kind of quieted off, but talk about PBMs and how that's affected.

I personally am, you know, I'm a veteran, but, and I have some healthcare that's subsidized to the VA, which is a mess, another conversation.

But, you know, I pay a lot out of pocket for mine.

My stepsister has a condition that is also very, very, very problematic.

And we're talking about, you know, it hits home with my family, and I'm sure you probably do with your constituents, that these drug prices and these insurance companies and how this is working, those PBMs affect it.

Now, is Congress, you or anybody?

They're actually thinking about potentially, like, addressing that?

Or is that just something that's kind of like part of the business?

It needs to be addressed.

Look, I supported Donald Trump's executive order, which basically said Americans should not pay more for our drugs than people in other parts of the world.

And Bernie Sanders and I had an almost identical bill where we said, if you're paying more than people are paying in Japan or Britain or France,

then we will.

We'll take the patent away from the pharmaceutical and have a generic that they can't be charging Americans three times more than they're charging people in Europe or Britain.

And Trump had that through executive order, basically saying, look, if you're charging more than other countries, we're going to penalize you.

That hasn't gotten any votes, even though either the Democrat was the one who was trying to introduce Trump's executive order and the pharma is going to sue Trump's executive order.

So that's not going to be in effect.

But we should have a bipartisan compromise.

We're not paying.

We're not paying through an arm and a leg for our prescription drugs.

Yeah.

And I see that you and Thomas Massey have really kind of like teamed up, kind of like on a lot of the bills that have been put forward from you guys.

You guys have co-sponsored a few bills I've seen because that's obviously the bipartisan there, which actually I invited Thomas Massey on.

But I think that they weren't quite ready for the for the Twitch jump yet.

So if you can put in a word, I'd like to I'd like I'd love to pick.

Massey's great.

They say he and I have become good friends.

We have disagreements.

But, you know, we've been partnering up on getting these Epstein files released.

They've literally shut down Congress.

That's why we're not in Congress.

Yeah.

Let's let's let's dive into that.

I was going to get through a few more things.

But, hey, listen, you're here.

It's something that especially the people that watch Twitch and younger generation are very interested in.

Could you kind of give us a rundown of the of your bill with Epstein files and the significance that you feel that this plays and what's holding it up?

Sure.

It's about basic justice.

Right.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've been rich and powerful.

You've raped underage girls, 13, 14 years, told those girls to go recruit other people to be abused.

And they had no justice.

And this has gone on for decades.

And there's a files that are existing by the FBI that have interviewed a lot of the other men who either covered up for Epstein's pedophilia or participated in the farm system of of having sex with these with these women.

It's the biggest American sex scandal, probably a politics scandal.

It's the biggest American sex scandal.

It's the biggest American sex scandal.

It's the biggest American sex scandal.

And we've had politicians in history, certainly in modern history.

And people are like, why should the rich and powerful get a different system of justice?

Why do they get away with everything?

Why are they making the money?

Why are they getting to do these kind of trusts that don't avoid that avoid tax?

Why do they even in the case of a pedophile get away with everything?

So what Maxine and I said is we want to release the files.

Trump promised to do that.

J.D.

Vance promised to do that.

They haven't done it.

And we've gotten 217 signatures to force.

the vote because the speaker isn't bringing a vote. And it turns out that there's a 218th member

which would force the vote. It'd be a majority of 435. And that person is Adelita Grijalva. And she

has won the election in Arizona. And for two and a half weeks, she hasn't been sworn in because you

have to have Congress in session to be sworn in. So the speaker is so afraid of swearing her in

and having a vote on the Epstein files that for two and a half weeks, we've literally not been

in session to the point where you as a veteran will appreciate this. And thank you for your

service. I don't know what branch you were in, but I was talking to a mom and her daughter was

concerned she wasn't going to get paid. Usually Congress is in session so we can pay the troops.

Now, Trump is rearranging money and he's found $8 billion from some other fund, the Pentagon.

Who knows the legality? I'm glad that the troops are being paid. But call Congress in today,

tomorrow, any day, so that we can pay the troops, so we can pay federal workers, so we can

get government running again. The only reason we're not in,

is because they don't want us to have a vote on the Epstein files.

And from what I gathered, and correct me if I'm wrong, what I heard, at least coming from

the administration, was push our bill through for the budget or whatever, without the health

care subsidies and whatnot, then we'll reopen the government and then we'll revisit it. So

it seems like they're kind of holding this hostage, or what do you take from that?

They're basically holding it hostage. First of all,

vote, right? They have 51 senators, they have the House representatives majority,

and they have the presidency. They could pass it tomorrow. People say, well, what about the

filibuster? Well, they got an exception to the filibuster to confirm judges, to confirm

presidential appointees. Why can't you have an exception to the filibuster to keep government

open? So if they want Democratic votes, then the Democrats are saying, you've got to extend the

Affordable Care Act tax credits, because otherwise premiums are going to skyrocket in this country.

They're going to double for people.

And that's all the debate is really over.

And as far as the budget, when you guys, because obviously this budget is massive. I mean,

one of my biggest gripes about the way sessions are done, I think a lot of Americans feel the

same way, is that it's especially earmarks, right? Obviously, we're not in a society now where you

could have single issue bills because it would just stack up for years on time before they ever

hit the floor. But earmarks.

Bill could say, you know, save, you know, starving homeless children bill. But inside it's

subsidies for this and, you know, this and that. And then everybody has an earmark. And so

just to give you an example here in Florida, a few years ago, we had a vote on our ballot and

it says, do you want to have the ability for oil rigs to be off the coast within a certain mile

of the coastline? Right. And if you voted no, then you also voted for banning vaping indoors.

But if you wanted to vape indoors, you had to vote yes for oil rigs at the beach. Like that's the

kind of thing like like is there ever going to be a way where we can or is that just par for the

course now? That's exactly how they play the game in Washington. That's why some of us like Massey

and I have been pushing for single issue bill votes. Right. Don't lump everything together and

force people to vote on a big, big conglomerate bill that has tons of bad things in it. Have

votes on particular issues and get people on.

That's the way the game's played. Look, they're literally shutting down the government because

they don't want a single vote on the Epstein files and they aren't allowing us to to vote on things

like paying the federal workers, paying the troops. So, you know, people feel that Congress

and government has has really been broken for a number of reasons. One, the hate that's been

perpetrated in our society and hating each other, the extremism. Second, the role of money in

politics. I mean, I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of

times where I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of times where

I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of times where I've had a lot of times where I've had a

lot of times where I've been corrupting. And then I don't think a dime of PAC money dine the

lobbyist money. There are about ten of us in that no PAC caucus, but the role of big money in

politics has been corrupting. The gerrymandering has been corrupting. So it's a dysfunctional

system. All right. Well, this is great because we're just like rolling it. I want to spend more

time on each each area here, but I know you have limited time. So I'm just kind of letting you kind

of take the lead here. And you're rolling in a few things. As far as political action committees now,

know that um you know citizens united wasn't it well it wasn't what made it it kind of allowed the

the the secondary uh case that allowed for for the the political action committees and whatnot

and you know we got like a a three-pronged problem here right we've got political action committees

we've got think tanks and we've got lobbying right and right now you know we've kind of pushed from

it used to be the nra was the big one that was talked about now it's apac i hear a lot about um

from from people talking about the the politics and and the money that comes from there uh think

tanks um and and lobbyist groups you know obviously the money's going in there how would we and i'm

sure we're never going to get there but how let's just pretend that we could do it you and i we could

build a put a bill that's going to get voted on how would we get money out of politics i mean my

idea is is that every politician should wear like a nascar type thing and their sponsor and their

their their donors would have to be a patch on their thing but i don't feel like that that's

what would you do if you if you were like you you or you could just do an executive order right

because apparently that's the cool thing now how would you get money out of politics well first of

all i think we need more politicians taking a pledge like i have not to take pac money lobbyist

money and i've been able to raise money now look i represent an affluent area silicon valley but

online you can raise tons of money now uh being tell me how please i because i'm i'm hurting over

here well you're not running for office you're running for congress i don't want to i don't

want to you guys can have it

so you know i think we need more politicians who are going to be going to the grassroots and not

taking pac money not taking lobbyist money we we have a bill uh summer lee and i to abolish super

packs and that would say look if you were giving a candidate money for congress you can only write

them seven thousand dollars for a cycle but you could go in the next room and write a million

dollars to their super pack how is that legal even under citizens united so what we need to do is say

you shouldn't be able to contribute more to the super

pack than you can to a candidate that would get rid of a lot of the super packs in this country

and then uh we need a to overturn uh citizens united ultimately uh and have uh strict contribution

limits for uh for for money and not have packs and lobbyists i mean it's a it's it's it's one of

the biggest things you have defense contractors you got pbms you got insurance money uh all of

that's preventing us from having health care and child care and housing forever

um and citizens united was a big one but i think a lot of people also know that citizens united

wasn't actually the one that that caused it it was the one that opened the door it only allowed

for like it actually citizens united actually a lot of people don't know i'm not a fan of it but

i think a lot of people don't know that actually allowed unions to start uh uh raising money as

well it was the one after that that was the actual um case that that allowed super packs and packs to

have unlimited funding so um yeah and which is which was a mistake i think it was a mistake i

think it was a mistake it was a mistake it was an unconstitutional act in the dc court

and that's why she got the super pack and so that was the actual case but but what they

had specifically decided in the dc court that didn't go all the way up to the supreme court

because what they said is that uh you couldn't restrict the contributions to super packs why

like why is it that you can restrict the contributions to a congressional campaign

committee someone can't give a million dollars to a member of congress's campaign but they they can

United in Maine did it. 70% of people in Maine supported it. How many bills do you have out

there right now? We've got, I've got probably about, uh, 30, 40 good bills that are, that are

working on some of them obviously become law, but there's a core of Congress. No, it's impressive.

I mean, like, you know, that, you know, to, to be able to, to, to constantly like come up with

these and obviously they're not all going to get voted on, but it like puts it out on the record.

And speaking of, um, what we were just talking about, one thing that I've, I've, I've always

found, and I think most people are frustrated with this is that we want changes in our government,

in our Congress, because, but the problem is, is that the people who are going to vote against

their interests are the people that are gaining from it. Right. So for example, what you're

talking about, like why would Congress vote to stop their funding? Like, where is that

self-preservation there?

They could lose their job. They could lose their job. I mean, if the citizens care enough

about it, right? Like, why is it that Congress has never passed a pay raise for members of

Congress in like the last 25 years? Right. Why, why doesn't Congress just say, okay,

we're going to vote to pay ourselves a million dollars a year?

I can think of a few reasons.

I don't want to give any people any ideas. Anyway, it's because that everyone knows that

if you vote for a congressional pay increase, uh, you're going to get hammered back at home

and you could lose your seat. Now you probably get that, that, that, that's the, that became

a big issue. And so the only time Congress votes against their interests is if people

actually care about it as a voting issue. Most people fundamentally view what they care

about is what are you doing for them, right? What are you doing to improve their healthcare?

What are you doing to improve their jobs? What are you doing to fight for them? And

they're more concerned about that. The problem is with the corruption in Congress, with the

role of big money in politics, with the role of super PACs.

Hard to get the agenda that's actually helping people. So we have to always link, okay, if

you make this change or reform, how is it going to help the person in your communities?

How is it going to get them a good paying job? How's it going to make sure they get

healthcare? How are they going to get a living wage? Because most people aren't paying attention

to politics 24 seven, you know, they watching the 49ers game or they're go Jags. We've got,

we've got too many injuries, too many injuries. Yeah. Whatever excuse. It's cool. It's cool.

It is what it is. It is. Yeah. So, you know, that, that's, that, that, that's why, but I think

right now there's a whole frustration on corruption. I mean, look at the president,

right? I mean, like his family with cryptocurrencies making out millions and millions of dollars.

They've got like foreign governments investing in cryptocurrency and meme coins. And that the

scale of that is, is so shocking for people that they want, they want a accountability that they,

you know, a certain kind of people in this country believe the American dream is slipping

away. And yet rich and powerful people that are continuing to build wealth and public

service has become a means where people end up building well either during public service

and needs to be outlaid or afterwards.

I have a bill that says don't let members of Congress become lobbyists. Like you go

on the armed services committee, you sit there for nine years and then you go work for right.

Yan or locky come on.

But, so,

we really, a lot of people. toutes.

woman.

Are although.

need to reform the system but fundamentally we what we need to do is tackle the economics as

well i i agree with that but i want to you know be very candid here no you know as a politician

i understand you know the idea of of you know of of of saying or not you but like as a politicians

as a whole you know talking you know about people vote for who helps them but i'd like to counter

that with at least how we see it please it's no longer voting for someone it's now voting against

someone a politician no longer has to go out and prove they're the best candidate they just have

to prove that if you vote for their opponent america is destroyed and i feel like the average

voter first off young people don't vote in primaries i hear people all the time say congress

needs to have uh term limits or age limits and i'm like you know that you they don't we don't need

that's the easy way that's the lazy way right

the real reason is is you need to get out and vote in the primary because what happens is is

younger people don't vote in the primaries they vote in the election and the the candidates

already chosen for them so they keep saying why do i have these two terrible candidates right

well it's because older people who know that their interests are going to be protect are the

ones who vote and you're just left over so maybe you know a national holiday for primaries or

something because younger people have kids and jobs but i find that it's no longer about proving

you're the best candidate it's vote for me or if the other person wins america

dies or you are going to lose this or lose that so it feels like it's more about fear

and less about i'm i'm a good candidate who's going to help you as opposed to if you don't

vote for me they're going to you know destroy america you're absolutely right and uh you know

that's why i was drawn to president obama who ran much more on what he was going to do vision

and bernie sanders who ran on what he was going to do for people right bernie was talking about

free public college and medicare for all and taxing the wealth i mean whether you agreed with

him or not he had a vision and president obama was talking about how we're going to bring change

in a politics that's more aspirational the problem is that we've gotten so cynical that people just

look at trying to attack the other person they'll find something about them that that people don't

like and uh they know that no one trusts politicians and so we've eroded trust and

it's the easiest thing to do to make another politician seem that they are not in it for you

that they're corrupt and because there has been a lot of corruption in washington there has been

a role of big money there has been people making uh money off of like uh cryptocurrencies and there

has been money uh being abused and so we're in a system where people don't don't trust folks

and that's our biggest challenge as a democracy how do we restore trust and then how do we restore

uh a economy that works for everyone i i don't you know talk personal politics because i don't

the my what i do but one thing i i do believe and i'm going to bring this up here is is that

the reason that the two-party system has no accountability is because there's no third option

right it's either you're with us or you're with them right and yeah and when and when and when

competition you're an econ you're an economic economist you know you understand this competition

drives quality right because if you have competition you are forced to be better quality

but because there's only the r and the d which are both

private parties they're not even you know they make their own rules i mean that's just how the

dnc and rnc are without a third viable option there's just no other you know uh ability for

for for quality control nobody's gonna you know all i have to do is is be be not what the other

side is and it feels like you know with the way the rules have been set that we're never gonna

see that so without that option and you know without you know and just this idea now that

we're getting more polarized

do you think it's gonna get worse before it gets better do you think well i'm a big fan of third

parties and candidates running i mean i'm a proud democrat but i've never said don't run as a third

party i've never tried to discourage people bernie sanders famously was an independent right who ran

in the democratic primary and if you look at the people who've done well and i have plenty of

disagreements obviously and vehement concerns about what trump's doing for the constitution

and rule of law but they've both kind of been bernie was and trump mavericks of saying look the

system isn't working we've got to change things so i i i think we want more people running in

primaries i think we need a new generation running and challenging and comments i think we need multi

candidates running in places so that you do have accountability so you can't just say oh the

republicans terrible you have to worry about other parties as well uh and we need people who are going

to offer a change from where the status quo is a clear road map how people's lives are going to get

better uh and how we're going to have a

politics where we're not just attacking folks i i mean all that we're trying to do is attack attack

attack attack as opposed to like here are my ideas here's what we want to do that to make things

better i feel like we're you know we've gotten to the point though where like if you i get called a

fence sitter uh a centrist or something not because i i i'm i'm always like a both sides

kind of guy but because i just don't take a a policy stance because of the the the the content

policies affect economics and finance and yeah and not and not so much like oh well this is good

because xyz so but i think more and more people are feeling that like i you know it's it's like

almost like a radicalization like not quite the horseshoe theory yet but we're there so you know

to move off of that one thing that and you've introduced a bill for this that democrats and

republicans tend to be on the same page with is what we're seeing now with with congressional

trading right like this has become a big thing

and you know this is something that has become a big thing and a lot of younger audience my

audience pays attention to it uh a lot of people are following congressional trades on some of

these websites my stepsister the same person we were talking about earlier she's even in on it

now she's doing that pelosi tracker thing right you you know she you know pelosi's kind of like

the the even though she's not the most prolific she's kind of in like the they even have etfs

named after her so yeah there's a pelosi etf tracker there's whatever and so people follow

congressional trades you introduced a bill to to kind of stop that

let me ask you this do you as somebody who's up there and sees it do you see that there is a

conflict of interest there and with a lot of these these guys that are doing this and if so

does it you know is there a way to to stop it or is it just kind of par for the course

yes there's a uh conflict of interest and uh the it erodes trust in in in government if someone is

uh doing their job and voting uh and at the same time trading sucks now do i think that

majority of members of congress uh are doing it in a way uh to game the system i don't but it is a a

conflict of interest that people feel uh erodes trust and so that's why i supported abigail

spangberger and chip royce trust act years ago uh to ban it and to say people should uh family

members can put their uh money in a trust uh and members shouldn't be trading uh and i introduced a

uh legislation i supported it recently which

aoc and uh a republican teamed up i'm trying to uh tim burchite uh to ban uh ban the trading the

the challenge has been we haven't gotten a vote i mean i introduced a five-point political reform

plan that went viral where i said ban members of congress from trading stocks have term limits for

members of congress members of congress can't become lobbyists and take away pac money and

lobbyist money clean up the system that people are desperate for that but what happens is that we

every couple years we introduce

these bills uh term limits people have been introducing since the 1990s and then the speaker

of the house whether it's a democrat or republican uh hasn't brought it for a floor for a vote it's

kind of the same thing with the epstein files right once we get a vote on the floor of the house of

the epsom pulse i think we'll get an overwhelming uh vote uh majority of huge majority with

republicans and democrats i think if you have a vote on a bill banning stock trading banning pac

money banning lobbyist money telling

members you can't become lobbyists you'd have an overwhelming vote so the game is uh don't don't

uh bring it for a vote so how can people here because you've got a savvy audience really see

where folks stand they can look at who sponsored the aoc birchite bill who sponsored the trust act

like where where do members stand and i i don't think we're even at 100 co-sponsors anywhere

close to 100 co-sponsors yet yeah out of 435. uh so we've got to get you know at least 200 250

and not to put you on the spot because obviously you know near air but i remember when pelosi was

actually asked about it when she was speaker she said no i think it's a free market you know

congress should be allowed to trade and then now the speakers of the when there's people

of republicans up there they're like we don't want like it's very difficult to get this done

when the actual speaker of the majority parties are kind of like hey it is what it is i think

that that's right i mean and then i think she said no no okay now we should listen to people like we

abandoned i think her point was that most people in congress republican or democrat

uh aren't coming to congress to game the system and engage in insider trading but what she wasn't

seeing is that the perception out there is so negative and that there are uh conflicts of

interest to restore trust in government i'm not saying this will restore trust we've got to also

ban pac money we've got to ban lobbyist money but yes we've got to restore this trust and by

the way we should do it for the president and the vice president too oh yeah yeah what happened on

friday we could talk about but here's what i think a lot of uh politicians may misunderstand about

the regular voter when it comes to this stuff it's not that we think that their votes their voting

you know you know is so much that they're they're making votes that are affected by their trades or

their their investments it's more the other way because you may not vote you may not make a vote

that affects your investment but your investment is going to affect your vote you understand what

i mean by that

so in other words they may not be buying something and trading or making a vote on

that trade they made but if they do have money in individual stocks that they've invested in trade

over time you can't see your nest egg your retirement the money you have when you leave

congress and say i'm going to vote against my my best interest you know even my self-interest it's

almost an inhuman thing like why would a human being have money in a defense stock or you know

in palantir or in whatever and then vote against their interests right were they you know i'm saying

that the the the i agree but i think people can look at people's voting records right like do they

vote against the defense budget would they vote for it do they vote for uh holding prescription

drugs accountable or not in terms well that could be packs as well or donors right like we were

talking about some of the the packs like you you talked about uh like i said i don't i'm not getting

into the politics of it but you you had recently talked about aipac right i had it but but i want

to be clear because apec is just one path yes there are hundreds of these packs and my view is

we need to abolish all the facts and the most pernicious wet packs are big pharma actually

they're the ones that put the most lobbyists and the most money into congress and so uh the

question i think people need to ask is why is it that people aren't standing for medicare for all

or take having uh insurance companies not be making the profits that they are uh or uh americans

paying so much for prices uh or our huge bloated defense budget yeah it's in my view the biggest

reason is the packs and the money of into the campaigns i'm not saying that the stock trading

isn't an issue with christ but when i actually ask members interact with members of congress

and i see their reluctance to vote uh with the people on these things i think that the

biggest issue is is is money in politics and that's why bernie when he started with his

campaigns and uh a lot of the reform candidate campaigns start with get rid of the super packs

get rid of this uh get rid of this money but i think in addition we shouldn't have

members becoming lobbyists we shouldn't have members trading it's an easy way to we shouldn't

have the president the vice president trading we shouldn't have supreme court justices trading and

that this is a reform and there are trusts that the trust access let's put it in a trust where

it's clear that the member isn't uh engaged in any of that activity so the truth is some of us are

just jealous i'm not even gonna lie sometimes it's not even about the trade it's just like

i wish that because remember right before covet happened you had that group of congress

uh members go

in with that closed door meeting with scientists and with uh people from from you know the

you know that whole world come out sell all their stocks and then two weeks later the whole market

tanked and that kind of that was that was really uh what triggered a lot of this yeah that's what

kicked it all off because i think that there are people were really uh had some kind of information

uh now you know just because i want to be factual none of those uh senators after investigation were

found for you know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know

insider trading but who investigated them i i really don't know i i think the justice department

did investigate but but the point is that that people said well look you you shouldn't be in

a situation where you're getting sensitive information uh and then uh and then making

decisions based on that or the perception of that and that's why i think it's a a very legitimate

issue and that's why right after that i got on the abigail spain burger and chip roy trust act and

this. And my view is that we should be having more people in Congress push for it. I mean,

people should be asked about it, right? Like, I never get asked about this in a town hall. Are

you on the Abigail Spanberger Trust Act? I don't get asked about it when I travel. So if people

want this to be an issue, then members of Congress need to be asked about it. I get asked a lot about

health care. I get asked a lot about billionaire tax. I get asked a lot about the issue of jobs.

So I think we need to get more members of Congress calling for the ban.

All right. And I know, how much more time do you have? Because I want to make sure I respect your

schedule here. I think they've got me scheduled. How about 10 more minutes? Is that good?

10's good. Because I'd love to tap on two more things and then ask a question or two from the

audience that's not crazy, because these guys are... So real quick, tariffs. One thing...

How have the comments been?

Oh, they... Because my audience,

this is probably the most diverse and oldest on the Twitch site. It's a lot of people having fun

and trolling and having a good time. But so far, everything's good because I think the one thing

that they appreciate, at least I appreciate the most, is that you're not campaigning on here

because I don't like when some politicians do that. You're being very straightforward.

Have you had a lot of politicians on?

I had AOC on when GameStop happened. You know, Brian Deese, the former head of the national...

He was on recently. I've invited Republicans on, but they all say no. And this isn't a slight at

them. I just think...

You know, I think that the Twitch atmosphere probably comes across as a little bit different

in the political space. So tell Massey that I'm okay to come on because I'd like to pick his brain

too.

I think you're very substantive. And I think that we need more conversations like this. And I

learned something about that trust thing that I've got to look up to have...

Well, one thing I like to do is I tell my audience, like, raising taxes on billionaires is great,

right? But if you don't cut spending, it doesn't do anything. It's like having somebody who has a

spending problem, and they make $250,000 a year, and they don't cut spending. And they don't cut

spending, but they spend $300,000 a year. Well, all of a sudden, you give them $400,000 a year.

Do you think they're going to not up the... Is it going to... No, you've got to get their spending

before or at the same time you get the revenue increase because it really... And then I like to

talk about what's called, in my opinion, what's called actionable things, right? Like you talked

about when I talked about the taxing or getting money from borrowing, like the billionaires do,

they just take their shares and go to the JP Morgan and say, hey, I'll put up this as collateral. Let

me get 3%. I don't get taxed. I don't get taxed. I don't get taxed. I don't get taxed. I don't get

taxed on it. And I'll just pay the interest with what I have left over and come back again,

right? Or the GRAT, which is being... That's where... Like loopholes with corporate tax rate.

You can't raise a corporate tax rate to 35%, but if Apple's paying zero now, they're going to pay

zero there. You've got to find the offshore loopholes where they're basically billing some

third party that they own in Cayman Islands for everything and showing zero revenue. So

these guys like you. It's great. I appreciate this. This is a good... I like substance conversations.

One of the things is that I...

I think we need more people who are reformed politicians, right? Massey's a reformed

politician. That's why he'd be great. AOC wants to reform the system. I call myself a reformed

Democrat. Why? Because I don't take PAC money, lobbyist money for banning PAC money, banning

members of Congress for being lobbyists. I call out my own party. I pick fights with PACs that

are supporting a different candidate. I've been for a ban on stock trading. Like we need to make

sure that the big... One of the big issues in this country is, are you a reformed politician

or are you for the status quo? Are you a reformed Republican, reformed Democrat, or are you just

like everything is working and let's just keep going and not rock the apple cart? And my

fundamental view is we need big reform. But do you find that you're towing a very

fine line between political suicide by doing that? Well, yeah. I mean, look, I get attacked.

I mean... I'm talking about from your own party.

From my own party too, yeah. I mean, one of the biggest things I got attacked for was when I

put out a letter saying, I'm not going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm

saying that we should have recognized a Palestinian state as a part of the two-state solution. I got

huge attack from my own party on that. I got attacked from my own party for calling for no

PAC money, for no lobbyist money. I've gotten attacked for my political reform plan that

members shouldn't be becoming lobbyists. People didn't like it. I was one of the early people who

was on banning stock trading. Now it's kind of more people are...

I'd say a third of Congress is there, but I was early in that. I got criticized for that.

I got criticized when I've called on some people in my party to step aside to make a new generation,

wait for a new generation, call for the old guard to step aside. But I think at the same time that

I get attacked and people then go after you in vicious ways. And that's why folks don't speak

up because you have the right-wing groups like Laura Loomer or all, they go after you in very,

very vicious ways.

That's why people say, okay, just keep your head down. Don't say anything because otherwise

they're going to come after you. They're going to try to go after your character. They're going

to try to demonize you. And if you don't say anything, then no one's going to attack you.

And so because I'm so vocal on banning PAC money, releasing the Epstein files, a stock ban,

it's starting a no PAC caucus. You put yourself out there more in the line of fire.

And you're also from a district that you probably don't have to worry as much about

being primaried against because...

It's pretty, you're pretty well known. You've been there a while. So, you know...

I don't worry about being a competition election. You never take that for granted, but I'm willing

to take certain positions and take... What's the point of being in politics if you're not

willing to take some risk and take some stands? And so I'm willing to now say, hey, here's what

I believe. And if people don't like it, they don't like it. It's the attacks. And it's with

social media, actually, the viciousness of attacks.

How do you do it?

People don't see the whole context in here. That's, you know, that you got to have really

have a thick skin. But when you're out there, I mean, they're doing this now to Marjorie Taylor

Greene. They're going, Laura Loomer is going after her because she's taken certain positions.

They're saying don't cut health care. She's talked about standing up on the Epstein files.

If you take positions that go against the system, then they all come after you. And then the way

they come after you is they go after your character. And they say, well, I'm not going to

say, oh, he's going after corruption or Marjorie is going after corruption, but they're corrupt.

And then if everyone's corrupt, then no change happens.

Do you see a similar fraction in the in the Democrat left side between people that are like

moving to the more Democratic socialist side versus the moderate Democrat? Do you see that

kind of not that, you know, but I mean, do you see like kind of that similar thing?

Well, what I call it is that I call it the reform side of the anti-status quo side.

Uh, look, I call myself a progressive capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist. But but I,

I do think that the fundamental challenge of capitalism is income inequality and we need to be

taxing wealth more and expanding child care, health care, uh, free college. And so I've

campaigned for Bernie. I was his co-chair in his campaign. I've supported Zoran Mamdani. And but

I also believe that we need sort of a free markets and and and the private sector to be part of job

creation. Are you friends by any chance with the one congressperson from Delaware?

Uh, oh, Sarah McBride.

Are you?

Yeah.

Oh, damn. Okay. Never mind. I'm moving to Delaware and I was like, all right, well,

listen, I'll run you. Can you can you endorse me? But never mind. I got you. I'm kidding. I'm never

going to be a politician. Oh, never know, Sarah. Oh, we throwing Sarah to the side. Never mind.

All right. Let's go, Roe.

She's incredible because a lot of people

know Sarah McBride just because she's the first transgender congressperson. But she's actually

a brilliant political philosophy thinker and a liberal. You know, you should get to know her when

you're I actually have no idea who who it is. That's why I asked you because I'm moving up there

and my wife wants to move to Delaware. So I but I didn't realize it. I don't want to start any drama.

I was just I thought it was funny because Delaware only has one room for start. All right. You may

have a recruit the stock guy campaign. I'm on Twitch. So I got to be careful with that one. All

right. Yeah, I like us. If it don't think too hard about it. If I said, Okay, Sakai, you're

President of the United States. Here are the three things you could do. What would be your first three

things?

Well, I might you talking about like executive order or like as a champion, this is the you're

speaking to the country. You just have been elected. Here's your three point agenda that over

the next year you're going to get done. I mean, the first thing I'm going to do and I don't I'm

not sitting here running for office. Okay, and you got me on the spot. First thing I'm gonna do is

spending under control. We are absolutely insane with our spending, especially our overseas military

spending. You know, you know, I think that we have a bloated defense and spending budget. I think that

we need to do that. I think that we need to do that. I think that we need to do that. I think that we

need to do that. I think that we need to do that. I think that we need to do that. I think that we need to do that.

We need to cut that down a little bit. And I would want to actually go in and find out where

this is. The problem is, is that we're in a world where once you give somebody something, you can't

take it away right without without setting the base. Are you familiar with the cheese caves in

Missouri? I'm going to send you my video on it something about dairy subsidies that we did back

in 80s. But we can't take it away even though we don't need it anymore. Because you know, it's that

idea. One is get spending under control a fine where that is. Number two is I'm going to I want

to work on like you said, safetiness.

Social safety nets. People don't want to talk about it because it's uncomfortable. You're a

capitalist. You don't want to talk about it. But we have the ability to have social safety nets.

The problem is, is that in my opinion, if we wanted to go tackle homelessness, we could do it.

We print money for everything else. Why can't we print money for that? Right? So so it's not that

we need to. No offense, but it's not that we need to raise money off of billionaires right away

because that's something you would do. But if we really wanted to tackle it, Congress could go out

there right now and say, you know what? Hundred billion dollars. The problem is, is where does

that money go? Once it goes into the government red tape, it's gone. It disappears.

And then it trickles down. And so, you know, I would want to work on a government social or

social safety nets because I grew up in the system. My mom was a was a prostitute. My dad

was a drug addict in the hospital or in the prisons. I grew up in a children's home. I got

out. I had nothing. I went in the military. I came out, you know, so I had to you know, I was I was

an addict. A lot of stuff I did. So, you know, social safety nets are there, especially for

people alive. Yeah. But especially for people who, you know, kids and stuff and, you know,

in homelessness. And then the number three thing I'm going to do is if I could,

work on a way to instill trust in the American government. And in my opinion, the way to do that

is to actually go through and call people out and actually let it be known. Everyone's so afraid of

offending everybody. You know what? I'm in for four years. You can't you can impeach me, but

apparently you can stay in when you're impeached. So I'm going to go after and I'm going to try and

instill that. And it's going to be, hey, listen, you know, I'm going to I'm going to put this out

there. And if you don't vote for it, I'm going to blackmail you. I'm sorry. But, you know,

in other words, I'm going to say, didn't you receive money from here? I'm

obviously doing this for content. But no, I think I think if I was president,

you know, it's difficult to say because I don't want to be president. I don't want to be a

politician. I don't want to be in charge of other people's lives. I want to hold our politicians

accountable. And I want to be somebody who says, hey, I don't want to be in charge of other people,

but I want the people who are to know that we're watching and that they need to be better.

Voted defense budget. You know, one of the clips where I vote against the defense budget is on

Facebook. People are watching and they all like laugh at me. It's a 67 to one vote and everyone's

like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How are you going to vote? And then they kind of boo when I vote

against the bloated budget. But we're giving all these overseas bases, 800 bases,

defense contractors, companies making five million dollars in its taxpayer dollars,

56 percent of the defense budget. And then I agree with you that we need to make sure the

money is actually effective and being well spent. And I agree with you on trust and calling people

out, like call people out, saying like, OK, they voted for against

Medicaid cuts. And by the way, they're getting all this money from insurance industries and big

pharma and they're or they're getting where their money is coming from. That's the biggest thing,

I think, in politics is whether it's a NASCAR like shirt or whatever. We've got to look at

where the sources of money for politicians is coming from and why they're voting a certain

way. And I think a president needs to call that out. And like the V.A., you know, instead of

fixing the V.A., they just figure we'll throw more money at it instead of reforming it and making the

money go. And I'm somebody who watches the V.A. is broken, but everyone's afraid to fix it because

they're afraid if the things they implement lead to one that, you know, something happening to them,

it's political suicide. So everyone's like, just throw more money at it. It's like that's the

government in a nutshell. Let's just throw money at it and never fix what's wrong with it. Instead

of saying the money is that's put into it is more effective. Let's just add more and that'll solve

the problem. And all that does is bloat our budget without ever fixing the problem. And so. So here,

listen, next time you need to fix the problem, you need to fix the problem, you need to fix the problem.

Someone on your side, OK, about economics or whatever, you need like a like a straightforward

hard nosed guy in Congress. You call me up there. I'll be there, OK? I'll do it. I'll do it. If it's

I'm wondering if you're this is the beginning of your political. No, no, no. I have too many

skeletons in my closet. I've been on a dress here. I have things that are called blurbs that would

make me unemployable at McDonald's, let alone be actually, you know what? Nowadays, that actually

gets you elected. That gets you elected. You need your you need your share of scandals to be

considered. All right. I'm sure Sarah is like behind you. I'm sure Sarah is like behind you.

I'm sure Sarah is like behind you. I'm sure Sarah is like behind you. I'm sure Sarah is like behind

the camera yelling at you that you got to go. So final thoughts. Can I ask one last question?

Yeah. Last question. OK. If the Epstein files actually get released, your field goes through

the full Epstein file, get released. What happens next? What do you think happens next?

I think there's a call for a prosecution and and and people who.

No, no. I mean, like the fallout. What happens in your opinion?

I think American people say finally, like finally, these these rich and powerful

people who thought they could get away with anything. Finally, they're being held accountable.

Finally, people are starting to listen to that. See, there's an anger in this country. They see

my district, 14 trillion dollars of wealth, five companies over a trillion dollars, all these

billionaires and trillionaires. And they look at their lives and people say, you know what? I don't

know. My kids are going to do better. I don't know if you have kids. I don't know if you think your

kids are going to do better than you. And they think, what the hell has happened? Why? Why is

the country not working? Why are we not being able to make enough money to have pay our health

care bills or child care bills to education for kids, make the mortgages or rent? You know, why

is it that it looks like the community I live in is less well off, less jobs than we used to have?

What is our government doing? And they kind of feel like the government has just been co-opted

by these rich and powerful people who, by the way, can rape young girls and still get away with it.

I think the Epstein thing says, you know what? Enough accountability. We're watching you.

And the game is over. The free ride is over. You're going to now have people in politics

who are going to stand up for accountability. And they expect you to be working for people.

Now, you may not always be perfect and you may make mistakes, but we're going to make a

fundamental judgment of are you in this for the people? Are you in this to protect the system

that has basically been enriching the powerful? And that's, I think,

Epstein matters. That's why it's resonated so much. That's why people are cheering Massey and

me on. And that's why it's so afraid. I'm not cheering Massey on. He ghosted me.

Oh, you know, you would tell him to get over here. He's got 20 million dollars being spent

against him. You know that you got all these trolls attacking me, attacking Massey, attacking

Marjorie Taylor Greene. And they, you know, people don't realize that when you put yourself out there

on something like this, you're inviting a lot of anger. You're inviting a lot of criticism.

But ultimately, people that this.

This country has a sixth sense. They are able to tell, is this guy in it for the people? Is he?

Yeah, we don't agree with everything. He's not perfect. But is he in it because he wants to make

a difference or is he in it for himself? And that's, I think, the country desperately needs

a new generation that are going to be more in it to change things up and for the people.

And you think the last one, do you think the Fed's going to cut rates this month or you think

they're going to stay, stay, stay the course? I think they cut rates. I think the job,

job rate. I got to change my bet. It's a joke. It's a joke. I know. Hey, listen. Hey,

I know you got to go.

Sarah, Sarah. No, listen, Mr. Conner, Roe, I appreciate you coming on. This was a lot of fun.

I feel like, I feel like we could have done this a lot longer. So can I book you for a second,

second time to come on soon? Sure. I mean, hours is a long time.

I'm happy to do it. How about we do it in a, in a, in a few months?

Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

Let's do it. I mean, I appreciate it. I appreciate the conversation. I think

it's important to have these kinds of conversations. I think you're, it's great that you have a voice

out there.

And, and, and I really appreciate you being transparent. You know, I mean, I know as a

politician, you got to be, you know, sometimes careful with what you say, because, you know,

you're in a, in a spotlight and there's, there's, there's things going on, but you've been very

transparent. And, and I learned, I learned a lot. And I think you got something to go back to. And

listen, you got my number. If you ever have a question about something, not that you would,

but it's something about it. Like, Hey, whatever, send me a text. I'd be more than happy to, to,

to do. And you know, my thoughts on it. So and

Keep the conversation going. Thank you. And thanks to everyone for watching.

Yeah.

And, and like chat loved you. So come back anytime. All right.

Appreciate you.

Thanks a lot. Talk to you later.

All right. Let's see where, where my thing is here. All right. How'd that go? You guys liked it?

Good interview. I feel like that went really well. I feel like it was a good combo. I feel like

we got a lot out of it. I think it was a really good thing and appreciate you guys being here

for it. I'm really glad that we, that we, that we got that out of the way.

And not out of the way, but that we got that done on stream. You know, all jokes aside,

we do a lot of memeing here, but if I get the opportunity to talk about

these things with somebody who has more experience, more understanding and more inside

ability I like to, I like to have those conversations. And I think that it's one

of those things where even if you guys are disagree with somebody, whether it's their

politics, their party, their way that they do something, the way they handle something.

I feel like having conversations is,

is what allows us to grow and allows us to, to you know understand you know how, how things

are done. So I know some of you guys were like, Oh, you know, you as a Democrat, he's

going to do this or that, or he does it regardless. You know, if he was Republican, a Democrat

doesn't matter. Somebody that has knowledge in something you can learn from them and understanding

where somebody comes from. Something is important. He's not in my district. He's not in, you

know, my, my Congressman, he's, you know, whatever. And, and I, and I have no party

affiliation.

So it's not like he's one of my, but somebody like that is really awesome. And, and, and

to, to be able to do that. I got stepsister in twice, by the way. And so, yeah, so again,

shout out to, to, to Ro Khanna for coming on and being part of the interview. I feel

like we touched a lot of topics. I feel like we got into it in and, and thanks to him to,

to spending extra time. Yeah. He gave me an hour and I respect what that means. I'm sure

Sarah's going to send me an email.

Um, I blacked out for half of it. I only went on one blackout. I only went on one blackout

and I caught myself. I only went on one blackout when I caught myself. And that was, that was

on something else. And then when he asked me about being president, I was like, you

know what, let me just go full throttle here because I'm not running a campaign like, you

know, but, but then I was like, all right, I got to remember that he's not used to my

specific, you know, so I was, I, whatever, but I did, I did okay.

The fact that you gave solid info is on loopholes. He may use to influence policy in our country's

amazing w you know, I, I don't like to think that, um, that I have any influence on anybody

and I don't know where that's going to be, but that's kind of like people often hear

me talk about something like, Hey, just saying taxing billionaires doesn't solve the problem.

And people like, you don't know what you're talking about. You're just, and I, and I say

that, no, you have to understand where I'm coming from. Like things are actionable. This

is how you get it done. And you know what, by telling somebody in Congress about something

they may not know, and they are someone who says they're going to be reforming on this,

you just never know if that moment in time changed the course of whatever, you know,

who knows if it doesn't, it doesn't. But it, like you said, it's nice that we were able

to talk to somebody directly. Cause you know, something people talk about wanting to talk

to their representative, but never get the chance to do it directly. And hitting him

with the cheese caves was a nice touch, man. It was a good interview and just resubbed

for 15 months. Okay. And to the person who called me a snitch, when I told him about

the loophole, listen, I get it.

Okay.

Okay.

I get it. I'm not a snitch, man. Some guy goes fucking snitch. Like I'm not a snitch.

I was just saying like, if you like, this is just some information. Okay. I respect

him for coming on. I do too. You know what I mean? Like, you know, it takes a lot for

somebody to go on to a space like Twitch that most politicians don't know. He's never been

on here before. It's a live stream. You don't know what you're getting into and to sit down

and do that. It takes some balls. I give him, I give him that anybody who comes on, it takes

balls.

Um, but the more we do these interviews, hopefully more people that know that that's

just kind of how we operate here. No blurbs was definitely the call. Yeah. There were

three ads or an interview, bro. I can't help you with that. I'm sorry. Okay. Oh shit. Something

in my portfolio has been mooning the whole time too. I need to get them on sooner. AOC.

Well, no, AOC had been on Twitch before. She kind of knew, uh, understood it a little bit

better. Not that that doesn't, you know, take away from it, but just so people are aware.

Um, have you had anything to chase?

I bought serve in my portfolio on Friday and I went balls deep in, uh, Keurig Dr. Pepper

recently, but those are the only two things I've added. Uh, post a full interview. I want

to send it to my brother. It was good. It's, it's there. I mean, I can try to just post

it as a full video on my, um, um, on my YouTube channel. I still have the Brian Deese one

too. Look at KDP. Wait, why? I haven't looked at KDP since two weeks ago. Oh my God. Our

main play today.

Oof.

I'm going to be honest with you guys. Um, that was a, that was a, it was a good, really

good interview. Like I said, I'm really happy we did that. Um, I got, I did get, Oh, what

happened here? Um, I, I, I am going to be honest with you when we started talking about

the Epstein files and he dropped a couple of those words, like you'll notice my eyes

went big. Not because it just, I mean, because I'm so used to doing certain things on Twitch.

I was like, Oh, it took my brain a minute to be like,

to be like, is that allowed? Because I forgot that when you have, it's all about context

on Twitch. When you have a sitting member of Congress, who's talking about these files,

it's a little bit different than when somebody just kind of like drops that in the middle

of a conversation. So my brain had to take a little second. I was like, Oh, like, I don't

know if we can say that. And then I was like, no, we're okay. You're getting better at interviews.

You let you ask questions and led rather than talking over. Okay. Um, you're moving to Delaware

to unseat. Uh, no, that's not what I'm doing. I honestly had no idea who the Delaware Congress

person was. I just was, it was funny because Delaware only has, has two centers, but only

one Congress person. So the joke was like, do you know that one person? Yeah, I'm going to go

unseat them. Are you going to endorse me? And then when I found out, I was like, Oh shit, no,

no, I don't want to do this segment right now. I don't want to do this segment right now because

this is going to get taken way out of context. I had no idea that the Congress person from Delaware

was the first like transgender.

Congress person looked like a good old boy from Florida going up there to unseat them. You know,

like that wasn't what I was trying to get across. Now that I know that I'll vote for you. Okay,

bro. Don't make the joke go too far. Okay. Honestly, that was the best interview I've

ever seen on Twitch. Okay. You don't have to simp to me. You didn't ask him for a YOLO.

I kind of did. If you don't know that I can't help you, but, but that was it. I feel something

Felicia day was the best interview of all time. I forgot about her. No, no, not like,

not that she's irrelevant, but like, I forgot about that interview. I did a lot of interviews

years ago. The interest rate was clutch. Did you do good today? Oh, you did good today? Question

mark. I am here for stocky Taylor tearing down the Delaware political sphere. I'm going to move

to Delaware and I'm already going to be on like six lists from the government. Like, like they're

going to think I'm coming there for like, for a political, like, uh, like, like, like a disruptor

or some shit. Like the local police are going to be watching me and shit. The Congress,

he's coming, you know, like, no, no, that's what I was doing. You're telling me you couldn't get all

five people in Delaware to vote for you. There's more people than that. Can you get Anna Paulina

Luna on next? I mean, if there's any, you know, I always love talking to politicians because

I feel like when they come onto this stream, like regardless of, of what, um, you know,

they're, they can't, they have to be held accountable. I don't, I'm not a gotcha person.

I'm not a person who like tries to, to corner people or anything like that, but you, you,

you, you going to be held accountable and I'm going to hold people accountable.

You know what I mean? Regardless of him or Congress. That's why I even said,

when I talked about the insiders in Congress who sold all their stuff and he said, well,

they were found to be not guilty. I very clearly said, and who investigated them?

The justice department. Exactly. You know what I mean? That's like, oh, we investigate ourselves

and found no do wrong. I'm not blaming him for that at all, but I'm just saying like, I, I,

I'm going to hold people accountable, but you know, he, he was pretty, he was pretty transparent

about things. So like, you know, I mean, my job is not to be like,

I got to, you know, it's just, if you're, you know, I liked that. It was a really good stuff.

There was a few things I want to get to. I wanted to get to tariffs and stuff like that, but we just

had a lot of fun. That was a really good conversation. Okay. All right. All right.

This was a hell of a, of, of a time. Sarah and I, his PR director and I are talking and he said,

you know, do you want me to get my, she said, do you want me to get my name out of it? But I

didn't see it. I said, thanks for giving him to me for the extra 15 minutes. She goes, that was

great. Thanks so much for having it. And now I'm going to say, bring,

me, Massey.

Should I send it? Oh, I hit send. I hit send. I hit send. I hit send. Burn the bridge.

FBI going to be calling you. No, no, no. I didn't mean, bring me Massey like that.

Man, we nailed it today. IO and Q was our main play because that catalyst big jump today,

spy right back up. Man, we had some really good stuff today. No, I didn't say bring him to me

in a trunk. What is this? I didn't say bring him to me in a trunk. I didn't say bring him to me

in a trunk. What is wrong with you guys? All right. I guess we're going to skip what we learned

today because we really didn't do a lot. That was a very quick day, but a really good, really good

worth it. Why no YOLO? There's certain things to joke about and other things not to. You really

should run for office. No, I don't want to be a politician. I really don't. NNE 18% today, guys.

EVGO 10%. Joby five. We got plug 11. Guilt is going. TRVD from TVRD from this morning is still

going. We're now at 11. We're at 11. We're at 11. We're at 11. We're at 11. We're at 11. We're at

Clit is green too. A clit, clit, clit. Clear is good. C-L-I-R. All right. Who are we rating today,

guys? Oh God. That TBH we bought this morning. We're up 50% on it. Why didn't you guys tell me?

Why didn't you guys tell me that? What did we buy that at? 90 cents. We were late to it too.

Okay. Well, I'm going to go ahead and

just stop loss that. Jesus Christ. Between TVRD and TBH, we're having a damn good day.

All right. Let's go ahead and rate somebody. I got to get out of here. And that wore me out a bit.

Worth it. But thank you guys for hanging around and being part of that. And hopefully we have

more in the future. Good stream, good trades. You're retiring? No, I'm not fucking retiring.

I'm moving. Okay.

And stop talking about it because Java's getting really emotional. We're not leaving you. I'm

leaving in a month. I'm just clearing out things so I can separate what I'm giving, donating,

what I'm throwing away and what I'm keeping for the move. And then we're going to do all that.

It's okay. How come Will hasn't put any of the whiteboards up lately? Which whiteboards? What

are you talking about? What do you mean? The Japanese illusion thing and then the McDonald's

thing? Give him some time. Okay. He has to put one clip out every day. Okay. He's under a lot of

stress. All right. He's got to put one, one minute clip out every day. He's, he's, he's working hard

for that money. Okay. Give him some time. Punk ass. When is the interview going to go up on your

YouTube? Um, is this how Rome felt? No, we'd be gone for more than three years. No, I'm not.

Guys, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm leaving it. We're leaving in a month. I'm going to miss one day of stream

as I drive up to offload myself. And we're going to have a bigger room in a bigger house, guys.

We're going to have more room. Okay. We don't have to share bunks anymore. One minute clip.

How much?

Is he able to do that per day? I know. And he gets paid more than most people in third world

countries. Hey, stock jock. That's funny. Cause I'm about to get off stream right now.

You missed the interview or did you watch it on your stream and call me an idiot?

You should have done. If you didn't, I'll, I'll, I'll never. If you weren't watching that interview

and roasting me horribly, then what are you? I'm sure everybody here knows. Um, no stock jock is

one of the, one of the true, uh, real ones in the game out there. A lot of people out there,

bullshitting and lying about their trades and their trading and they're selling courses and

shit like that. Stock jock's not one of those. He's a real one. So, uh, for those of you guys

who, uh, need somebody who's not as annoying as me to watch in the morning, um, check them out

mods. If you already shouted them out first time watching, but I guess this is the last time as

well. Now, wait, this is your first time watching it. I'm not leaving. This is I'm moving in a month

guys. I'm just clearing out some stuff. Will you, will you stop it? Okay. I'm not going to get milk

coming back. This isn't goodbye. I'm not quitting stream. I'm not even moving yet. I'm moving to

Delaware. I got to go to Twitch con in two days. Okay. Then I'm coming back. I got like two weeks

of sponsored streams and then I got to drive up and then I'm just setting up my stuff in the new

house. He is a real one. He will actually stream the rest of the week. Jen, you are toxic this

morning. I like it, but damn retiring from what? I don't have enough money to fucking pay my rent

next month. How am I going to retire? I thought they didn't have internet in Delaware. Good luck

stocky. I'm not, what do you mean?

Good luck. This is like when my ex said we just need a break. No, no, no, no, no, no. I hope you

have a great retirement. Miss you. What, what, what, what is this? What does this have to do

with my retirement? What are you talking about? Retirement? What the fuck? All right. Any of you

still in IO and Q great trade today. Uh, everything else is absolutely moaning too. Uh, if you're

still in a TV RD, we're up a 35%. Uh, TBH we're up 50% poet. Nice bounce back. Good stuff. Keep an

eye on stub hub. The rest of the day might have a secondary.

Run. All right. I'm not taking a break. Don't listen to these guys. They're just being

degenerates. I'm sorry. I didn't sub more often. Stocky, please don't go. I don't need your money

or your, this isn't, you got to plug your YouTube more often. Your videos are amazing. Is that my

new editor's alt account right there? I got a, I got a raid for you. One viewer, dad, he's the goat.

Why do they want a dad? That's not going to leave them. Is that your just call me born

Sanj. Hi there. My YouTube editor threatened.

To stop making my videos. If I don't raid you, is it cool if I send people? Okay. All right. Will,

is that the one look at this dude streams for four hours and says he's beat and has to leave,

but bitch. Okay. Will, is that the right guy or not? Cause I'm about to, I'm about to send this

and I don't want to send it to the wrong person. Then cancel the raid and get canceled again.

Jesus. Will is so bad at this.

It's yes or no. Just call me born. Okay. Is that you texting him right now? Telling him you're

trying to, you're trying to, trying to raid him. Hey man, I got this guy going to raid you.

Will you be a full-time streamer once you're in Delaware? What's your definition of full-time?

There's somebody out there working a hundred hours a week on an oil rig, calling you,

laughing at you about being full-time. Okay. This guy that you want me to raid isn't even

reading my message. So I guess I'm going to have to skip over him. Cause he's not even,

he's not even paying attention to what's getting read if I send people. So,

hey man, I got a retired Twitch streamer trying to raid you, man. Be nice.

Hey, good pick Will. It's just like your pick of a what, what, what clips from the stream to put

out there. TikTok getting 600 views a video. Will you ever stream from market open to close? I do

sometimes, but I have, I have kids, man. I got to go pick up my daughter. I can't just leave her

at school for three hours. This dude still hasn't read chat. Wow. Will good job, bro.

Oh, finally.

Of course you can send people.

Okay. There we go.

Tell your YouTube editor that he's a bully.

My YouTube editor has a disability. I can't fire him. Okay. All right. For that guy that was asking

earlier. Yes. We do stocks, basics and stuff like that. If you go into discord to top where it says

stock market basics. And for beginners, there's two GitHub links that send you to all the free

info that you need on the internet. You don't need to pay anybody for that shit. Hang out here. We'll

learn some stuff, but I don't have time now. I got to go. I'm too good for you. Sorry.

That's all I can say to that one.

But to everybody else, it's time to get naked and get out of here. Okay.

What's the YOLO before you go? What do you mean? That's a YOLO. I already, you already have YOLOs.

Um, um, what is this?

It's your breath.

Um, Yodel. Y-O-D-L because you Yodel from a mountaintop, right? At the top. So it's got to

go up like a mountain. Okay. So there you go. Yodel. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's not Yodel. It's

Yodel.

Y-D-D-L. One and one green technology. One and one equals two. And it looks like Yodel. You know

what? Fuck it. I'll buy a couple of shares with you. All right. Just so you don't feel alone. Okay.

Here we go. Y-D-D-L. Okay. I'm going to buy 100 shares just to be with you. Okay. I don't know

what that means, but what this stock is. And it's got double D's in the middle. And you know what I

mean? Y-L. I'm sorry. Let's go. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's get

naked. We got to get our clothes off. All right. I hope Roe and his team aren't watching. Or Sarah.

I'm about to get naked. All right. Let's go, guys. All right. Remember, become an organ donor. It's

the greatest gift you can give. It doesn't cost you a thing. That's number one. Number two,

if there's somebody you love, somebody you miss, somebody you haven't talked to in a while,

give them a call. Give them a text. Send them an email. Send them a carrier page and let them

know you're thinking about them. Guys, you can really make somebody's day. But more importantly,

go make your own day. You got the rest of it. Make the best of it. And remember,

as long as you got two healthy kidneys, you ain't broke. Otherwise, I will see you guys tomorrow.

Hasta mañana. Hasta luego. Mi amigos, mi familia, cabrones, bandidos, y todo. Gracias.

Por todo. To my lurkers, I know you're out there. You are the backbone of this channel. Thank you

so much for being here each and every day. To everybody who gifted, subbed, donated, gave bits,

followed, whatever you did. You're absolutely crazy simps. I don't know why you do it,

but I appreciate you. And to each and every single one of you, thank you for being here and letting

me keep you company doing whatever it is you're doing each and every day. And as long as you keep

coming, you know I'm going to keep coming too, baby. I appreciate you guys. Go fuck yourselves.

Tell your mom I said hi. She got a fat ass. And as always, as always,

stay green, you DJs. Remember, short week. Literally going to be here tomorrow. What is?
