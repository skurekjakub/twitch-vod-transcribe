Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

All right, my main play is Rumble.

I got some NMRA and...

What was the other one?

NTLA.

Keeping an eye on Pump, PayPal, and Fate after open.

Got us a day-to-day.

Five stream streak and you basically own the stream now.

How are you?

I'm not good.

I'm not good.

But I'm going to get through it.

I needed this stream, honestly.

I need this stream more than you know.

All right, let's go.

All right, we got a lot to look over today.

Lots of news over the weekend, too.

China stuff, everything.

What's the Rumble play about?

They're adding Bitcoin and crypto tipping on their platform.

And with IWM moving this morning, I'm just seeing if there's a perfect storm there.

Are you still in KDP?

Of course I am.

I went hard on it when it went under $26 in my Chase account.

So we'll see if they call me again.

All right, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

We are live.

All right.

So, China trade news.

Obviously, we've got that.

We've got a lot of stuff.

PayPal is going to be one to watch.

Fate is going to be one to watch.

Pump if it comes under $7.15.

Let me grab a little bit more NMRA.

All right, big, big morning.

Palantir, 3%, up over $190.

Google, $2.66.

SoFi, $30, guys.

I don't know if you guys got into JZXN with me last week, but they pumped 60% this morning.

All right, let's close some positions here.

Buy the dip, sell the rip.

WeRide might be an interesting one to watch, too, with the news this morning.

Plug having a good morning.

Uh, everybody having a good morning right now.

Everybody.

Um, GPUS has been free money at $0.36 as well.

GERD, a little nice move.

MLTX going again, so we'll keep an eye on it here.

A-R-A-A-F, OTC stock.

Okay, I told you guys you got to be careful with OTC.

I'm glad it worked out for you.

Y'all got to start being more careful with that stuff.

Okay, um, Klarna looking good.

We got Joby doing really well this morning.

We took a Disney call last week, too.

Everybody in the market getting tipsy.

It feels like that.

Buy the dip on UUU.

I think, I don't, I think it might dip a little bit more, but I would buy the dip on it.

Just because this, uh, the, the, the rare earth, um, export thing that the, uh, the Chinese are talking about is only for a one-year extension.

Three just to sub for 44 months.

I hope you get well soon.

Did you get stopped out of Sava?

Yeah, I got stopped out of Sava, yes, uh, Friday.

I'm not telling you to buy UUU leaps.

That's not what I said.

All right, so we're watching some of these here.

We grabbed a little bit more NMRA here, um, just off of the, uh, of the Guggenheim upgrade.

Um, Fate.

Also got a big one this morning.

Pump.

Uh, they're going to be powering data centers, so that's going to be interesting to watch.

Uh, got a lot of dry powder from last week, so I haven't really deployed it yet.

Uh, we've got, uh, Mir doing really well.

Our, uh, our, I, I grabbed the 2028 leaps, uh, but they've been doing really well.

Uh, Piton trying to go for the 300 apiece.

MOH still going for those of you guys that got into it.

Helena Troy, finally, finally.

Even though they're not moving that much, at least the contracts are doing nice.

Um, Palantir new.

All-time high.

I know, right?

That's wild that Palantir, uh, you know, fell, you know, the way it did, and then it's right back where it was.

All right, I'm going to grab.

I'm actually going to jump into some UUU calls.

I already have my shares, so.

I mean, the January 26 calls, which are kind of crazy to think about, but they're only 300 apiece.

Yeah, Palantir was a tough one when I first started buying it in 2021, because it kept falling.

All right, PayPal.

Looking interesting for a day.

Trade here.

I think I'm going to jump in on shares.

Normally, I wouldn't jump in on PayPal, uh, but, uh, the, uh, that MasterCard integration is kind of big for them.

So, oh, shit.

I forgot we had IONQ shares from last week.

So, I'm going to day trade this.

I'm going to leg in here in case it falls.

And then, uh, add some more if it goes under 70.

Again, I, I, be careful, guys.

Oh, there goes fate.

Um, be careful.

With, uh, with, with stocks today, guys.

We've seen this before where we've seen a huge gap up overnight and then profit-taking happening.

So, just, just, just don't get locked in or, or, or, or tie, uh, you know, uh, you know, too locked into a position.

I know it feels like every time you sell, it keeps going.

So, you sell early, but then when you don't, uh, it, uh, it, uh, it ends up, uh, hurting you.

So, don't, don't, don't let yourself get caught in that, okay?

All right.

Um, are you selling KDP today?

No.

No, I, I, I like it for a defensive play.

So, that's why.

That's why I'm still gonna stay in it.

Are you buying the Chewy Dip?

No, but I'm sure I'll hear about it at some point this week.

I, I don't know if I will or not.

Good day to get into UU.

I mean, it depends.

I mean, again, again, I, I, I think there's a chance it pushes a little bit lower, but

even with the rare earth, um, deal with, uh, with China coming out and saying, hey, we're

going to be, uh, uh, uh, you know, curbing our export, uh, or, or slowing, you know,

canceling our export ban for a year.

It's only one year.

Turn off the ads, bro.

You're rich.

Realize that ads are, like, not a choice, right?

I think a lot of people forget that it's a requirement on the platform.

Are you still in Klarna calls?

I am.

That's what y'all are forced to say.

That's just, I, I'm gonna be real with you.

I don't mean to say this, but I, I ain't got the energy to deal with some of y'all today.

Just have at it, but I'm not gonna engage.

I just don't have it in me today.

I just don't.

I just don't.

You still have Ryder calls?

Uh, yes.

Boomer energy?

I wish that was the case.

I'll, I'll, I'll talk about it later.

I don't want to kill the mood right now.

So, um, yeah, so PayPal shares there.

Just see how it's going.

Um, and, uh, are you an NVX?

Yeah, we've been an NVX for a long time.

Oh, oh, we nailed it.

Almost the bottom there.

Okay, half a percent up.

I got a hundred shares.

So I'm gonna put 50% at, uh, half a percent, or 50 shares at half a percent and 50 shares

at, uh, one and a half percent.

So it's a 1% average, but I got it.

It's tiered.

You sold KDP last week?

Feels like that's how it goes.

Sometimes, right?

Can Willie be into the bear gang?

Okay.

Because I also was basing it off of, you know, uh, uh, the way that I have always, you know,

gauged the market.

You're up 9% on the UU call stock, you thanks?

I just bought them a few minutes ago.

I haven't looked at them yet.

Oh, shit.

I'm up 20% on them already.

Okay.

That wasn't bad.

Why is UU down?

Well, because, uh, the, uh, the, the, the news from China is that, uh, as we talked this

morning, is that they have the, uh...

Uh, uh, Besset said that they had a nice talk.

The threat of 100% tariffs on China are now off the table.

China's expected to resume substantial U.S. soybean purchases.

Besset said he's actually a soybean farmer.

And Beijing says they're going to delay rare earth, uh, export controls by one year.

So the, the fact that there's a, a, a less chance of, uh, of, of, you know, or more supply

potentially in the market is obviously going to drive it down.

But I still think UU is still a play because I don't, because I still think that that's

just a flush out from rare earth that we expected if the talks went well.

But that, um, uh, there's still, you know, a demand for uranium.

And not only that, that UU, you know, any, any change, any change in the China trade

talks with, with, uh, Trump set to meet Xi, if anything doesn't go well, boom, it's right

back up.

Oh, the, um, Wilmington VA reached out to me.

I'm not used to 302 numbers yet.

Thanks for the UU signal.

Not a signal service douchebag.

Do I have a hostage?

Thanks for the 30% on UU.

No.

Out of all the planets in our solar system, the only one I'm interested in exploring is

Uranus.

Okay, bye.

So Coinbase fell through?

No, no, no, no, no.

Um, Coinbase I'm working with very closely because I want to, uh, make sure that, um,

you know, I'm, I'm familiar with the platform and everything like that.

I'm not just going to throw something in front of people.

Um, wow.

I forgot that we had the IO and Q shares.

Huh?

Chewy's under 35.

Well, you know what to do.

Just buy a couple of shares at a time.

I remember buying it from 20 all the way down to 15 before it went 180%.

So great exit on NTLA, dude.

Uh, it's not a great exit.

It's just a trailing stop loss.

You know what I mean?

Like I, I have to do it for every time I have a trailing stop loss that, that, that, that

stops out.

And then the market, the stock moons, there's a hundred times where I stopped out and it

was a good sell.

Any news about your dog?

We'll talk about it a little bit.

I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, mess with the morning vibes yet.

Number one.

And number two.

Um, you know, I, I, we're, we're, we're, we're having to, uh, handle that as a family

and I'd like to just kind of keep most of it as, as, as the family.

All right.

Um, but I'll update you guys.

All right.

Joby looking good this morning.

Did you reach out to your friend, Miz?

What's going on with Miz?

Just saw the Lulu deal with, uh, NFL.

I have had a very, very rough weekend.

So I haven't kept up with anything.

What's going on with the puppy?

I'll, I'll talk about it a little bit.

If it's something that, if it's something.

That's going to give me stress or anything, please guys, just not today.

Okay.

I know that I usually don't show what I'm dealing with shit, but I got a lot of shit

going on right now in my life.

And, and I, I was numb all weekend.

I just, I, I, my, so I, I, I was really looking forward to the stream cause I needed it, you

know, for my health.

So, so let's just, let's just catch me up on it later in the week.

Okay.

Any reason my fidelity account isn't updating the market?

Have you refreshed it?

What's the earnings play for this week?

We got to go over earnings because I want you to know that if you look above you and

below you.

In this chat, there is somebody that is here today that will not be here next week.

Okay.

Someone in this chat above you and below you right now is not going to be here next week

because of this.

Someone is going to, someone is going to absolutely make an ungodly amount of money and lose it

later or lose everything this week.

Okay.

Because I want you to see this.

I want you to see this tonight.

Tonight we have waste management, bed, bath and beyond whirlpool.

Tomorrow morning, SoFi, PayPal.

I almost want to take PayPal calls.

I know I'll get hurt.

UNH, UPS, JetBlue, Royal Caribbean and Wayfair.

Okay.

Tomorrow evening, Enphase, Bloom Energy, Seagate Visa, which I have shares in, Electronic Arts,

Cheesecake Factory.

Wednesday morning, Verizon, Boeing, CVS, Caterpillar, Pfizer, Etsy, Kraft Heinz, ADP,

Phillips 66.

Then Wednesday.

Wednesday after hours.

Meta, Microsoft and Google all on the same night, which is crazy because they will affect

each other.

If one of them moons or falls, it could reverse the other stock in a way just because of that.

Right?

Chipotle, Carvana, ServiceNow, Sprouts Farmers Market and Starbucks.

Thursday morning, Eli Lilly, which I think is an interesting one.

Roblox, Baxter, Advance, Autopart.

Then Thursday, Amazon, Apple.

Coinbase and Reddit all in the same night.

Western Digital, Rocket Companies, IOT, Cloudfair and Roku.

Okay.

And so far, only 18% of the S&P 500 is reported, but 85% have beat.

Thanks for KDP three weeks ago.

It's funny because that was the first time I'd ever even traded KDP.

And I was like, I'm going to buy this for my long-term portfolio.

And I gave the whole reason why.

And I bought, you know, I bought a good bit at $25.90 something or whatever.

And then this morning, I didn't even realize I had earnings this morning

because long-term shit like that I don't look at on an earning-to-earning basis.

But at one point, they were up 10%.

They hit $30 this morning.

Will you full port SoFi?

I already have enough SoFi shares to deal with it.

Although I'm going to have to sell some of my equities this week.

I want a choice.

I want a choice.

Kit, nice W this morning.

Thanks for the WeRide call.

We actually talked about WeRide this morning.

WeRide had...

Had...

Uh...

There's all these little hints.

There's all these little hints out there.

And this morning, during the morning call,

we talked about what NVIDIA's CEO said.

And again, like, nobody's saying it out loud,

but there's some, like, there's some...

Our little theory might get a chance to get, you know, get real.

$45,000 is too much, bro.

First of all, if you don't know what I'm talking about,

and second of all, Eagle, not the fucking time.

Not the fucking time, okay?

Not the fucking time, bro.

I mean, I'm not trying to be a dick, but not the fucking time, bro.

Are you cutting rates?

Are they cutting rates this week?

I mean, everyone has priced in the rate cuts of 25 basis points

because they did say that they're going to do two by the end of the year,

and there's only three months.

But, um...

But the thing is, is that of the three months that they might skip,

there's an outside shot on CalSheet and PolyMarket and stuff like that.

It's only 3%.

But there's a chance that they might delay this month

only because they've not gotten any of the data.

But who knows?

I mean, basically, it's almost 100% priced in that they're...

They're going to cut this week.

We ride time to join the orgy?

No, they're just edging us.

Because NVIDIA...

We talked this morning.

NVIDIA's...

And that's why we were watching a rewrite from Open this morning.

NVIDIA's CEO just comes out and goes,

Hey, um, we are, uh...

We're...

We're gonna...

We're planning a robo-taxi project to challenge Tesla and Waymo.

So, okay, we know that NVIDIA's partnering with Uber right now,

and that's just data collection.

So if NVIDIA is now saying that they're reportedly...

It's reportedly planning a robo-taxi project to challenge Tesla and Waymo.

And they have a small stake in WeRide, which is a robo-taxi...

You know, I mean, again, I just don't...

It's just like we're getting...

You know what I mean?

It's just like...

It's just like...

It's just like...

But, you know, I don't want to put all my hopes and prayers into one position or one play

because if it doesn't work out, then, you know, you're effed.

And I own...

I own...

I own Uber.

We all bought Uber earlier this year at $60-something.

That was our, like, sleeper play of the year.

So it's not like I'm not...

I'm not positioned to take advantage.

But still, it's like, ooh, you know, like, what's the thing here?

Also, GPUS, guys, every time it's hit $36, we've bought...

It has been free money.

It's gone over $40 almost every single time.

Yeah, I actually picked up more WeRide the other day when it went under $10.

I think the best play last week was when we bought all those Hive shares

when it went under $5 because Hive came out this morning

and was like, hey, yeah, you know how we're targeting $30 exahash?

Uh, yeah, we just surpassed $22.

Yeah, we were at $11 earlier this year.

It's like, wait, what?

Yeah, also, we're mining Bitcoin from a fucking waterfall in Paraguay.

Do you still like cybersecurity sector?

Of course I do.

It's the most undervalued sector in the stock market.

Man, that Ford run last week was pretty wild.

Any thoughts on the space sector?

Which one?

Rockets to send stuff into space or actual value of stuff in space?

Because the actual space sector is...

The only value that comes from it is communications.

And, um, and military and defense, right?

So, um, if that's the case, then, you know,

it's all going to come down to mostly government contracts in the beginning

before they become, you know, more privatized.

So the question is, is who is going to get those government contracts

and who's going to do that?

Because people think that, oh, well, they're going to go mine fucking asteroids and shit.

No one's going to mine an asteroid.

It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

Okay?

The dumbest thing I've ever heard.

Oh, we're going to make money from mining asteroids.

That's just, that's just dumb.

Okay?

So I don't, I don't...

I don't get that.

So it's either telecommunications or weapons and defense.

And you're going to rely on the government for that.

Especially for weapons and defense.

Now, if you're talking about, like, um,

if you're talking about, you know, regarding, I don't know, uh, you know,

the rocket launch, you know, who's going to send them up?

Obviously, you know, we got the news last week that a bunch of, uh,

EU companies are going to start taking on, uh, Starlink as well

because there's, you've got the global race.

But, you know, you've got a lot in there.

You've got, you know, uh, AST, well, AST has more, more, more satellites,

stuff like that.

But you've got Rocket Lab.

You've got...

You've got, uh, uh, Lunar.

You've got all these different companies.

And they're all competing with the private sector as well.

So, uh, you know, I'm not sure.

As far as, as far as the communications space, I'm big in guilt.

Um, I have a huge guilt position because I've been buying it for, you know,

over a year because I've been focusing on the communication side of it

that nobody's paying attention to because everyone's focusing on rockets and defense.

And I kind of look at what's the undervalued part.

And Galid Satellites has been a very consistent,

kind of like how I switched from ACHR to Joby a couple years.

Because if that sector does take off,

I figured I want to be in a company that's, like, the more solid and has the,

you know, not, not the meme run and not the, like,

has actual, like, boots on the ground and has permits and contracts and,

and whatever, FAA deals.

And so I've been doing that with Galid.

And Galit, Galit, uh, Jalit, you know, whatever you want to pronounce it,

Satellites has been absolutely, just unbelievably backlogged on contracts.

Like, they just keep getting contracts.

And internationally, too.

They're getting ones in Peru.

They're getting ones in, in, in Europe.

They're getting all of these defense, or these, these, uh, communications and,

and, and, and, and, you know, uh, satellite deals.

And so, uh, you know, other stocks have done, like, this and this and this.

But they've just consistently, you know, gone up.

So, you know, I mean, to each their own.

Like, I don't want you to invest the way I invest.

But, you know, if you ask me, I'll tell you.

And, and this was one that, you know, was, was one that I just was like,

okay, I did my research on it.

I followed it.

And I was like, okay, this is, um, this seems like the kind of thing I really want to,

I really want to, I want to invest in.

And so we found it right here at $4.30.

I am shorting the, what the fuck is that?

Is that even real?

That's not real.

Although LGBTQUSD Gaze Inu is real.

Wow, it's gone down recently.

It's gone down a lot.

Holy shit.

I didn't know this was a real thing.

I learned something.

Holy shit.

Wow.

It was a wreck for a little bit, but then it, it just collapsed.

This is like a pump and dump.

That's wild.

I didn't even know that was a thing.

Buy it or you're not an ally.

Oh my God.

Shut up.

But yeah, Gilly, uh, or Galat, whatever you want to call it.

Uh, there's been a good one.

It's been a good one.

Um, it's, uh, it's been, you know, off and on, but we've been, we've been following it

for a while.

And, uh, I think they, they just had another contract come out.

So as you can see here, like just, just, just cause I'm a, I'm a news guy, right?

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm the type of guy who like looks for a company that may not have

the best balance sheet at the time or whatever.

But looking for it in an emerging market or emerging sector and who's getting the, you

know, pushing as a charge to the leader in that sector.

And one thing I like is, is, is, is, is subscription based, you know, uh, you know, models like

with cybersecurity, right?

But in these cases, government contract, I want you to think about this way.

This is how I look at it.

Government contracts are like a subscription based model.

I love companies that have subscription based models because what does that mean?

That's especially autopilot.

That's just money coming in.

That's just money coming in.

And most people forget to, to, to, to.

To cancel it or just keep it just in case.

And the government does the same thing.

When the government gives out contracts, especially the larger corporations and companies, they're

just basically a subscription based model.

And with, with guilt, um, it's not necessarily government contracts, but the way that they're

being, they've been getting these, these backups or these backlogs.

Um, I mean, $42 million multi-orbit, uh, sky edge for platform contract from two weeks

ago.

Okay.

$66 million, uh, private placement from, uh, institutional companies.

Okay.

So you got more money flowing in $7 million contract from the department of defense on

September, $25 million agreement in Peru, $60 million order for their terminals, multi-million

dollar contract from Israel.

Okay.

You've got the, uh, $60 million, uh, from Peru, uh, initially 7 million from the army.

And that's all just since July.

Okay.

That's all just since July.

And it just keeps, you know, it keeps going.

Um, $22 million order.

Another one in July, $27 million, uh, order, uh, for their terminal technology in June,

$40 million contract in June, $25 million in order for their satellite solutions in

May, $15 million order in April defense order in April, $11 million defense contract in

April, $23 million multi-year, uh, contract to service the STT units in April, $6 million

contract in April.

Another contract, uh, for the sky edge in March, 3.5 million from CroSense.

And that's just this year.

We're not even, that's not even a $4 million defense contract in January, 3 million in

January, 9 million, uh, multi-orbit sky edge platforms in January.

So you get those and then you look at a market cap right now.

And of course they're not going to be able to, that backlog is probably going to get

messed up for them, but they got a market cap now of 960 million.

But back in January, you know, they're not going to be able to, they're not going to

be able to, you know, back in January, the market cap for them was what, um, 300 million.

And they got a backlog of like 400 million.

I literally bought guilt after they couldn't stop announcing deals and still up a hundred

percent since.

Are these guys a Netflix or Hulu for satellites?

They're like the Apple plus.

I don't know.

I mean, I don't, it's a weird, weird, uh, um, a weird comparison.

Um, and thing is, is that everyone is focusing on, on the company that's going to get the

biggest contract or the biggest, like, you know, whatever.

And so, you know, if you get the right one,

you're going to, you know, have the big one or whatever, but Galit, Galat, Galat is like

the, the AMD to an NVIDIA, right?

Like everyone's trying to find the next NVIDIA satellite stock, but I'm like in the one that's

just like, all right, I'm just going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to get the

one that's got the value there.

Because if I'm wrong about this one, then I lose so much and I'm taking more risk.

I don't really want that.

Where do you even begin to look for these plays?

Investors Anonymous, but seriously, how I do this for a living.

So it's like, you know, I I'm always on the market.

I'm always reading news.

I'm always getting alerts and I'm actually, I'm not going to go over everything yet, but,

but with what's been going on the past couple of days, it's, it's making me be more, more

serious about being more present in my life because since I've been streaming and since

I, and I love this and stuff like that, I'm, I'm constantly like on my phone, I'm reading,

you know, like my, my, you know, I'm, I'm reading news of articles, I'm seeing stock

news, I'm seeing something pop up and notifications from X and I go in there and then it leads

me into an hour of whatever.

And I tend to not be as present in my life and I don't feel like I'm giving a hundred

percent to everybody, even though my wife disagrees.

But that's part of it.

It's just a constant, you know, flow of things and, and, and then absorbing it and then looking

and trying to put the pieces together.

I'm not always right.

I mean, look at what happened famously to me with PayPal in 2021 fucking nailed the,

the initial pop on it and then just didn't keep up with it.

Right.

Look at Walgreens a couple of years ago.

You know, I, I put it in there.

I said, okay.

What's happening and them doing these satellite clinics and COVID and everything like that.

I think this is going to be a good play plus a dividend.

And I sold it for like a 12 or 15% loss.

You know what I mean?

Like that you don't always get them right, but if you're going to be in a position for

a long period of time, you have to babysit it unless you just do be smart and just get

the total market or like a large blue chip or something like that.

But but yeah, so, you know, it it's one of those things where, you know everybody's going

to look at the same news, the same information and, and analyze it and take different things

from it.

It's just the way that I see things in the way that I invest in the way that I try to

plan.

It's just my way of doing it.

And you know, I've been dealing with the markets for years.

So I kind of like, and it's funny, I've been dealing with from years and even I'm fucking

confused on a day-to-day basis.

Like that's the reason I started selling Palantir when I was up, you know, 200% or whatever

on it, 300% up on it.

But I also kept some of it because I'm like, well, you know, I don't want to continue to

hold this.

If it's a.

The ratio of 300 and I'm up 455% on it.

But then I also thought to myself, you know, normally I would sell it, wait for a pullback,

but I'm going to keep some of it because this market's just different.

And I think Palantir long-term is going to be really well.

I just don't know if everybody's going to price it in early or not.

And I'm glad I held onto my shares because you know, I'm up 2000 something percent on

it.

PayPal earnings will suck potentially.

Yeah.

But I don't know if it's, if, if it's time to write them off yet, I really don't as far

as earnings.

Because they got a lot of news recently with the buy now pay later last week, they had

the news on the stable coin and then they had the MasterCard news this morning as well.

You think it's crazy to buy spy calls right now.

I think spy is going to pull back a little bit.

Like I said this morning, I think it's, it's nice that it's here, but be careful, especially

in the IWM there's a good chance that we might have some some some, some profit taking at

some point, part of the day, like not like, oh my God, take puts, but I would just be

very cautious doing that because this is a good day where people could potentially profit

take with Trump.

And she's still set to meet.

That's all I'll say about that.

Yeah.

SoFi is over 30 bucks.

I wonder if that guy who asked me where he should put $750,000 in three stocks actually

bought SoFi, like he shouldn't have, but that would be hilarious if he did.

NVX, UAMY and UUU getting murdered.

Yeah.

We talked this morning about this.

A good chance that you're going to see continued pullback with China talks from Besant saying

that they're going to delay the rare earth export controls by one year.

Meaning that all, all of the US stocks in rare earths that were going absolutely insane.

Yeah.

Yeah.

They're going to be like apeshit.

Uh, most likely going to pull back because there's not concern about a supply disruption.

However, however, maybe worth if they fall enough, maybe worth grabbing the dip on it

because we don't know how the talk's going to go with Trump and how this is going to

flip flop again.

Are you still holding SoFi through earnings?

Of course I'm holding my shares.

If SoFi falls 25%, I'll buy more.

If it falls 10%, I'll just wait.

Okay.

And if it moons, then I'm good.

I don't look at it from a day to day basis.

Okay.

I don't look at it from a day to day basis or week to week basis.

Thanks for we ride home.

Thank me.

You don't know what's going to happen with it, but the news this morning was very interesting.

D pro got over 10 bucks this morning.

That was beautiful.

I don't know if I should close out my MLT exposition or not.

I'm up 52% on it.

And I feel like because I don't know anything about it, I'm just waiting for it to gap up.

I feel like it's just a waste of time now.

Like that's not a good, that's not a good strategy.

Oh, we're back over a hundred percent up on our, uh, on our, um, Intel shares.

All right.

I'm getting into it.

I'm getting into it.

I'm getting into it.

I'm getting into it.

I'm getting impatient with rum right now.

I feel like there's other places I could put that.

Um, I want to buy some shares of MO this morning.

That me, that, that meme run for three days last week was fun.

Kind of sat it and keep my, uh, uh, my, uh, my beyond, uh, puts.

I think I got for like 25% of those.

I just figured I'd get Ivy crushed unless it was a good idea.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know what to put in my, my beyond a puts.

May I got four with 25% out of those.

I just figured I'd get Ivy crushed unless it really dropped a lot over two days.

And it really did the following day.

What was the NTLA play?

It was just a ah, a by the dip, uh, because of retail a FOMO on it.

And I think we got 20% out of it this morning.

Not in it anymore.

Did you follow the drama this weekend?

I, I, I have no idea what you guys, if you guys are talking about something with Twitch,

no, I was not.

I was having a really bad weekend.

I wasn't.

I wasn't on I wasn't even in discord until last night so I I know I haven't followed anything I've

been I've been off the internet for the most part this weekend if you guys could give me a couple

days uh or until tomorrow till we go see the oncologist then then then maybe I'll I'll be

able to be more on board with that stuff but that's about it lol qualcomm is mooning what's

happening with qualcomm right now how can I join the discord uh should you hit estimation discord

should send you in there I don't know what to do with my uh with my r calls they're green finally

that's because I averaged down so goddamn much you sold your qualcomm at 180 okay all right we're

pretty good what never called did you take on friday um what it was it uh let me double check

here uh it was the uh 1190 call for december 5th it's actually down right now we'll see yeah but

we got to go over some earnings stuff we got a lot uh we got a lot of earnings right now uh all

right paypal we're still hanging on we got this is why I tier my stop losses I got stopped out of

half the shares when it fell half

a percent from our trailing stop loss so we got stopped out from half of it there we got the other

half still running that's why tiered stop losses can be really really strategic especially when

you're uh when you're when you're in a a play like this um so half of it got stopped out for a small

game the other half we're still in for about 0.75 percent up so gonna run the other half of these

shares for the day um we'll see what what goes on with that got stopped out of some of the ionq that

we picked up last week nne looking real interesting under 44. do you put a stop loss on stocks you

see this bounces off 44 little type and now it's right there at 44 again like it's gonna if it breaks

below it's gonna like boom you know I'm wondering if that happens here visa running up I have my

visa shares um I've been in visa shares for for a while and the funny thing is is I'm I'm barely

green on my visa share just because I bought them earlier this year and never averaged down

I just never averaged down on it because I figured if it collapses I'll buy more if not

fuck it we'll see what happens um on our long-term port guys lumen

really good we're back up about 750 on that we ride doing really good today reddit 223 earnings

coming up uh on is back in the saddle here uh palantir new all-time high depro back over 10

so far at 30 tssi doing really good for us here um or is it hut back almost over 50 this thing

collapsed like 40 percent in just a couple days last week and it's right back up uh joe be back

over 1646 rivian back over 1327 google at 265 guys thanks for telling me about the nne dev a few

days ago bought at 36 I mean buy the dip sell the rip 265 on google that was not uh that was not uh

that was not in the cards right this soon sake help me understand you took puts on netflix through

earnings and now you have calls why so I took puts on them because of the the the boycott I

thought that that would slow down their thing they they didn't admit that they basically said

that the reason they missed was because of some fucking tax thing in brazil but institutions

love to buy netflix they just

love to buy it and in a market where it just keeps going up up up until all of it comes

crashing down you know that's the type of one that institutions will buy the dip on you know

what I mean not retail traders necessarily so I I'm I'm just playing I'm not looking for a big

jump on it I'm not looking for like a gap up here but let me show you all right so we took

puts through earnings which I sold too early of course of course right we took puts through

earnings and I don't even want to look at what those are

so we took puts through earnings we sold um I think right here and then I'm looking at the chart out

here and I'm looking at the levels right I'm looking at the same levels and we're sitting

right about where we were in April right after the first bounce back we had that big run and we're

sitting close to that and I'm thinking to myself okay at eleven hundred dollars because I had eleven

hundred dollar puts I don't even want it let's see what they're at now because why not when is

the futures trading stream happening I don't know man I have to do four of them uh as I want to do it

I want to do a few of them but I'm gonna do I think three or four of them um but uh I have to uh

supposed to do it last week but there were some problems on their end and then obviously Friday

was supposed to be the first day but we all know what happened obviously for those of you guys that

were here Friday uh and then I got uh probably this week uh tomorrow no because like I said I

have to take Bayo to the oncologist tomorrow um and then um so I'll be ending stream early but

then hopefully this week and then next week I mean I'm moving I'm driving up so so much going on right

um I I don't know how the drive's gonna affect and we're gonna see but um uh and then I should

be streaming by Tuesday to Wednesday of next week so I should be able to get the other two out it's

very difficult right now because there's just so much going on plus this house isn't ready we

haven't packed yet um you know they got to fly up and uh and from a from a from a from a financial

standpoint I gotta think of something because long story short this is you know things happen medical

things happen and it can be a big big just hit to you and you're not expecting it so I gotta figure

those things out but I should be able to get the other two out I should be able to get the other two out

I should do them this week and next week if all things go well you're actually moving yeah we

actually are back in September uh we found out that our baby we're expecting uh in March has

some pretty serious complications and won't survive long after birth I had to take a step

away from pretty much everything going on in my life I'm looking back glad I did it's okay to

take a break take as long as you need to process and grieve a little and not whoa that uh uh Jesus

um Sarah I didn't even know um um let's

um yeah no um a lot a lot going on I think everybody here's the thing everybody goes

through you know what I mean like sometime it's we'll talk in a second my wife's my wife's doing

her thing we'll we'll talk in a minute my wife's on the with my wife's on the um on the phone right

now with with with uh some important things but we'll do that but outside of all that uh

of my uh oh then he went the wrong way um Netflix is an institutional type buy okay

uh now you know at Netflix is a is I'll talk about my Bayo in a second guys uh is an institutional

type by the dip and uh so that's what I'm kind of focusing on right now is to see if the institutional

buys come in right now it's not happening uh I'm down 12 on it but uh it's a it's it's a pretty

close to the money call so I'm not really concerned right now so but we're doing pretty good on the day

we got a pretty green day here um uh biggest ones that I was looking at uh for this morning

obviously Rumble's just not moving yet it's just not moving yet I don't know why uh it's it's kind

of thought it might get them maybe it will a little bit later PayPal starting to move a little

bit though um so we're gonna see how this one uh goes they have earnings again we are gonna we're

gonna lose a lot of people in this community this week I'm just telling you right now we are going

to lose a lot of people in this week this this community this week because someone is going to

do it they are going to get cute they're going to go all in on some degenerate and they're

going to blow their account up it always happens on earnings weeks like this earnings weeks like

this always always always lead to just mass destruction it's not a threat

it's not a threat be specific strike and stock muffin how those Sam calls go for you a couple

years ago Qualcomm 200 what's going on with Qualcomm what the I haven't owned this

in years imagine you know we're going to find out later that somebody knew about this 107 to

150 000 right now never mind still going now we are at 115 to 160 000 return any uh anybody in here

going to jail later hmm anybody in here uh in any of these calls earlier all right here we go um 130

to 177 000. someone in here going to prison holy Lord have mercy launches Qualcomm a a1200 a1250

chip based accelerator I wonder I wonder what the the uh the open uh interest on these was before

now we're at 184 000 on the uh on the 187 calls holy Lord have mercy get God Almighty this market

is insane I know this is a stock guy but can you be the market guy for a second tell a dummy why

everything just goes up because it's where everyone puts their money the economy is not

the market the market's not the economy and people need a place to put their money because I want you

to think about this the S P 500 is up 14 this year the dollar is down 14 so it's break even

so people people that are are new to the markets think oh well economy looks bad so market must go

down that's not what happens right the market used to be

be kind of like a long-term you know gauge of where the economy is going to be over a set period

of 5 10 20 30 years but that's when the institutions ran the market it's retail traders it's it's

Americans that are just buying into it there there's nowhere else to put their money they

can't afford to buy houses crypto is expensive or too speculative or too new for them gold is

like you know boomer but people don't really everyday people don't buy gold I mean

they are now it's kind of a meme stock you just put it in the market you dollar cost average and

more people 62 percent of Americans are in the stock market now

as opposed to 45 percent pre-market so it's just people just put their money there it's it's a way

of of of keeping money there you can't keep it in your bank account you can't even keep in a high

yield savings account now so put it in the market and then it just keeps going up a lot of people

that are you know a lot this is why you see a lot of these like finfluencers or where the you

call them out there that are like oh this is just like the 2008 we're in for a huge crash or oh my

god the bubble's gonna burst or oh this and I'm like where do you come up with that well look at

what happened in this okay you're talking about something that happened 20 years ago this is a

different market

yeah but it can't keep going up forever and they said that 10 years ago 20 years ago 50 years ago I

mean it'll pop I mean eventually there'll be something that replaces this but probably long

after we're dead here's the thing the people who yell that we're in the bubble the loudest are the

ones on the sideline and that's not me saying that the market's just you know never going to pull

back or anything like that I'm just saying that this is where we're at you don't have a choice

now you don't have a choice any person out there who has any influence over other

individuals who tells people not to invest in the stock market needs to be needs to lose all

credibility because they're they're they're hurting people they're hurting people because

the only option it's unfortunate but the only option 90 of people have to ever have a little

break at the end of their life is to put their money into the market via S and P ETFs or 401ks

even if it's mutual funds you know it doesn't matter they have to do that you can't not do that

if if anybody who has any influence in the world tells people to keep their money out of the market

and keep it in their bank account or their savings account or anything like that is is hurting is

either stupid or actively hurting their their the people who listen to them because that's not how

this works oh keep it on the sidelines wait for the next pullback the next pullback could happen

after we've already gone up 60 and then you never get back down to this level and then you don't

know when to put to put it back in and you miss the next one and then you spend the rest of your

life sitting back I mean do you know why we get so many people who blame boomers

for for everything oh they have so much and we have so little do you know that a lot of the

boomers have it just because their was in the market for so long like if you even if

you put your money in the market you know 10 years ago right whatever you put in and let it

go over just just in the last 10 years it's gone up significant but think about that compounding

for 40 years right it goes up right that's the whole point I'm not here to defend boomers but

I want you guys to be the one that

the next generation yells at and say you're the reason they have nothing

all because you just put your money in and just let it go but what if the market falls then buy

more and if you don't have money to buy more you should be DCAing then just wait it out it's going

to go back up it's it's an it's an old boring saying but when they say time in the market

beats timing the market it means there's something there's a real reason for that it's not a boomer

thing how do I tell my dad to get away from his financial advisor 20 plus year the guy takes one

percent of his port value per quarter for uh or month my dad doesn't see why this is bad what

would I even do for him okay send him this okay all right let's say he has ten thousand dollars

32 years okay and he adds 1500 per month right seven percent and let's say his annual investment

fee overall right is from an annualized basis okay is point oh five percent which is high for

a lot of people okay okay this is probably the wrong calculator hold on some people need to see

Who has $1,500 a month for savings?

Are you mad?

His dad, who's probably in his 50s or 60s.

What are you talking about, dude?

If you're in your 50s or 60s,

you're not putting $1,500 a month away,

then I've got bad news for you.

All right, 50,000, average annual, 7%.

Okay, he's taking 1% per quarter.

So 4% a year versus something like the S&P,

like VU or something that takes 0.03%

or even a high-end mutual fund, which takes 0.75%.

Okay, that's the difference in his money in 20 years.

Okay, that's just $50,000.

Let's say he has $500,000.

Okay, they're going to take $700,000 of his money

in just 20 years.

Do it for 30 years.

Okay, look at that.

Look at the fees paid.

And 0.75 is very high.

So ask him, is 75% of his,

or sorry, 80%.

85% of his money, you know, of his returns gone.

I'm sorry, 50% of his money gone worth whatever he's using.

Now look at what I use for VU.

Now I'm not telling him that he should do his own,

but here's VU, 0.03%.

That's a million dollars.

And by the way, most firms are underperforming

the S&P 500 right now.

Not most, but a lot of firms are.

So why would you give up a million dollars

in 20 years to underperform the market

or barely beat it?

People don't understand how much fees are.

Like for example, I tell people all the time,

look at your 401k.

Look at your 401k.

What are your management fees, expense fees?

I don't know.

A lot of people look and they find out

that they have a 1.25%.

$400,000 in just 20 years.

In just 20 years.

Now look at it over a longer period of time.

I don't know if they give us a longer period of time here.

Okay, and that's at 7%.

Right now we're at 10%.

So let's look at your father.

4% versus Vu.

Look at the difference there.

That's just 20 years.

If this calculator could go longer, it'd be better.

He's going to give up almost $2 million.

And you're not managing it.

People think you've got to manage your money.

No, you're just buying Vu

instead of letting these guys do it.

Now, if you have several to tens of millions of dollars,

obviously you're going to want to go with a bank

who has people working for different things

and has protocols and extra.

And they're not going to charge 4%.

But the fact that he's paying 1%

per quarter, he's getting robbed.

He's getting absolutely robbed.

This is why financial institutions make so much money.

People think, oh, Stalker, you never worked on Wall Street.

You don't understand this stuff.

Most of the people on Wall Street don't understand this stuff.

Most of the people on Wall Street don't fucking trade.

They never touch a stock.

Their job is to convince you to keep your money with them.

Why?

Because they make all their money off of you.

And the less you know about money,

the more intimidating it is,

the more likely you are to let them do it.

Now, luckily we have competition out there.

Okay?

But look at this.

Let's say your father just maxes out his 401k, his IRA.

Let's say he's putting in,

let's just say he's putting $20,000 a year away, right?

Let's call it 8% right now.

Okay?

His annual fee is 4%.

And this isn't compounding.

Okay?

How do you do that?

How can you look and say,

I could have $3.7 million?

No, I'll give up $2.2 million of that.

I'd rather have $1.5.

The problem is that most people don't know

until it's so far away.

So far down the line,

how much they're losing in fees

that when they go to retire,

they say, oh, I should have about $3 million,

$3.5 million next year and I'll be retired.

Let me check on my account.

1.4 and 5, 1.5 million.

Wait, where'd all the money go?

Oh, sorry.

Okay?

Look at this.

Now, let's talk about what normal people are, right?

Normal people with their 401k

that they don't pay attention to

because they just sign up at the beginning

of their onboarding and they get a 1.5%.

Remember how I always tell you

that for every 1%,

you're going to lose 20% of your retirement

and people say, that's crazy.

No, there you go.

30% of your retirement gone.

Imagine paying a million dollars

for someone to do what you could have done on your own.

Now, put it like VU, for example.

Not that you can do that with a 401k,

but let's just say.

Imagine paying $25,000 versus over a million dollars.

Okay?

So when I tell people,

please look at your 401k.

Please look at your, whatever, whoever's managing.

That's why mutual funds are crazy.

Please.

Understand what your management fee is.

If you don't know what your management fee,

your expense fee, whatever they want to call it,

and total management fees are,

please, I'm begging you right now, check on it.

You don't know how to do it, go to your HR and ask them.

If you don't, call the company that's with it.

Find out how much you're paying in management fees.

In today's world, with the way that there's competition,

anything over a half a percent is crazy.

Anything over 1% is robbery.

Okay?

People don't understand this until it's too late.

Okay?

You have to know this stuff.

Because if,

you look at this right now, okay?

All right?

If you look at this right now and you say,

okay, $25,000 versus a $3.7 million, that's not bad.

That's crazy.

I'll pay that over 35.

That's nothing.

Now go back, okay?

And say, oh, I don't know my management fee.

Oh, it's only 1.5%.

Oh, that's nothing.

1.5% of my money is nothing.

That's nothing.

I'm going to have 3.7 million.

They're going to take 1.5% of that?

That's nothing.

That's like $30,000.

Nobody cares.

That's nothing.

No.

No, no, no, no.

That's 1.5% of however much money you have,

no matter if it's up or down,

every single year.

And oftentimes, they break it up quarterly to like 0.5% or 0.35 or 0.45,

so every quarter, which compounds even faster.

So when I tell you that, know it.

So if you go in there right now and you see that the total cumulative amount is 1.5%,

that doesn't sound like a lot.

That's a million dollars.

You're not going to have 3.7 million.

That's how much you would have had.

They're taking a million of that.

And a lot of times, they're underperforming the market.

Okay?

What about employer matching?

It really depends on the amount you're getting with that.

6% match up to a certain amount because remember, again,

I don't want to say this individually because if you have a substantial amount of salary

and they're matching a large amount of it, then yeah.

But if you're getting 6% return only up to a small amount and then the total assets under

management are 1.5% versus missing out on 6% up to half a percent or some bullshit and

then they're lower, again, to each individually their own.

I'm talking about as a general rule of thumb, management fees are where you lose your money.

They're where you lose your money.

I talk to streamers all the time, especially at TwitchCons, and there are streamers out

there that are getting hit with a 2 in 20 right now and they're underperforming the

S&P 500.

Some of them are just paying a flat 2% rate and I'm like, do you understand what that

means?

No, I have a financial guy.

Who takes care of my shit.

If you take into account Vu and their dividend, this is actually significantly higher because

you're going to lose, right?

You're going to lose.

And this is just general ballpark.

You're going to lose $25,000 in fees, but you're going to make over $100,000 in dividends

and those are going to compound as well.

So it actually, it's actually more like 4 million overall, but I don't want to talk

about that because I'm getting a little complicated.

They have a financial guy.

We have a homeless guy.

I couldn't even fucking think about doing my beard this weekend.

Goddamn Qualcomm's still going.

There's somebody out there who knew this was coming and just fucking made generational

money.

The 187.5 calls yesterday were $1 a piece.

They're now $2,000 a piece.

A hundred bucks right now turned into $200,000.

I'm getting through, man.

We're getting through.

Also, Sarah, I didn't mean to dismiss what you said earlier.

I just didn't want to dive into that right at the moment with everybody at the, you

know, what's going on.

I'm really sorry to hear that happen.

All right.

I bought some more NNE shares for the day just because it went under 44.

I don't even want to look at Qualcomm now.

All right.

Our PayPal shares that we got earlier are still doing pretty well.

Rum is just kind of just flatlining right now.

I don't know if this catalyst is going to push them or not.

No, I know, Sarah.

I totally understand.

And I appreciate you sharing that with me.

You know, everybody's got theirs.

We've got to battle, you know.

Man, it's not even about the battle.

It's just sometimes things get a little overwhelming, you know, and it's like, all right, what's the next step here?

Because, you know, sometimes you feel like as a head of your household, you feel like, you know, you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders, right?

You've got to make sure everybody's taken care of.

You've got to make sure that this house is there, this house is there.

You've got to take care of this, traveling, you know, financial, you know, business and stuff like that.

And then also the family.

Sometimes it just sometimes it just feels like, you know, you're just like, you just you just like you feel good and confident that you got everything.

And then sometimes something happens, just the straw, you know, one thousand two hundred seventy one Qualcomm one eighty eleven oh seven calls got filled on yesterday.

Somebody knew it.

Oh, oh, yeah.

Somebody always knows.

Somebody always knows.

That's crazy, too.

Eleven seven one eighty calls.

That's wild.

It's crazy, too, because because nothing's going to happen from nothing's going to happen about it.

You know, I mean, like we already know nothing's going to happen.

So it almost is like you hate that it's happening and you're like, this is bullshit, but it doesn't change.

It never changes.

Are you still holding C.O.F.?

What's your average?

Yeah, I got two left.

Let's take a look here.

We actually got out of some at six hundred something on Friday.

My average on that is five forty.

They're currently at five ten.

So I'm right at breakeven right now.

Two houses is tough.

I don't own.

What does that even mean?

Two houses.

What the fuck are you talking about?

Paying for two when you don't live in one.

And what are you talking about, bro?

I'm moving.

I'm moving from one to another.

If they made stocky A.I., we would be rich.

I did the cameo thing on Sora for for Andy.

And I did like a weird angle because I had all the light on my face.

And so Sora has made me like look different.

And in some videos, I look like I'm like really fat.

Other ones look like I'm really buff.

So I got to redo it for him.

Thanks for Netflix signal.

I'm up 10 percent.

This isn't this isn't fucking we have Sora videos.

Yeah, apparently I was.

And they're just in discord.

They're just giving out invite codes to everybody in discord.

They can go fucking make like.

A.I.

Videos of me.

And I'm really concerned about this now because this is going to get bad.

The good news is that Sora isn't really like quite got me yet.

And so I have plausible deniability.

I'm going to make some unhinged shit.

No, please.

For the love of God.

It's true.

Yeah, I know.

I saw you guys in there this weekend.

I wasn't talking in there because I obviously was going through a lot.

But I I I'm sure the stocky deep fake channel or whatever it's called is going to be filled

with these.

But I just happen to pop in there just to see what's going on.

I just happen to pop in there just to see what's going on.

I just happen to pop in there just to see what's going on.

And I saw everybody just passing out the codes, the invite only codes to Sora.

And I'm like, oh, no.

So far, they've been tame.

It's mostly just me and apparently a weird mouse making out in a store and some other

stuff.

But I'm going to have to update my cameo video just because I got to be, you know, I I almost

want it to look more realistic.

So that way some people like, oh, my God, these videos are going to make people think

I did something egregious shit and I'm going to get in trouble for it.

And I'm over here thinking these videos are going to be my my my my get out of jail for

me.

And I'm going to get a free card because if somebody sees a fucked up video of me somewhere,

I'm just going to blame it on Sora.

See, there's two ways of thinking about everything.

One is these videos are going to make somebody's going to make a video that's going to make

me look bad.

And I'm thinking someone's going to make a video that's going to that's going to that's

going to make me look, you know, look like what I really did isn't real.

So that's actually how I'm looking at it.

I saw a cat using a mortar.

I saw a German shepherd using a rocket launcher on a chihuahua across the street with the

with the mom yelling or the wife of the mom or whatever.

She's telling him no.

I said, guaranteed.

Yeah, some people, certain people run the government, see it as it is.

It is what it is.

I'm not here to I'm not here to judge.

I just I'm just saying that, like, I'm thinking to myself, OK, you know what?

You know, try to see the positive in everything.

Right.

Try to see the positive thing.

Right.

Like, like, for example, we found out on Friday that Bayo has late stage lymphoma.

OK.

And it was a really rough weekend because Bayo has been there since the beginning with

us.

It was my wife's dog and I have the video of it.

And he was there when we, you know, I want to talk about everything right now because,

you know, I don't want to bring in too much up.

But but he was there.

He raised the kids, raised everything like that.

And, you know, it's it's one of those things where it's like is a large mass in his chest.

So he's it's really gone there.

And it might be because we were gone to TwitchCon.

He was under a lot of stress that made whatever we but we found out.

Right.

And while it's really, you know, it's really rough that this is because anybody who's had

a dog and gone through shit, you know, like they're your best friend, especially for my

wife is her baby, you know, and he helped us raise the kids and he's been there through

everything with us, went on all the trips and was there and did it.

And, you know, it is what it is.

And there's two ways of looking at it.

Like, we're going to go to the oncologist tomorrow and, you know, to tell you what,

it's expensive.

You know, we went and we our coverage, our health insurance coverage lapsed by a week,

week and a half or something like that because we're moving to Delaware.

So we're just like, oh, we'll just pick it up when we go to Delaware.

Right.

And then we got.

Hit with this.

And on Friday, I had to pay five thousand dollars just there.

Boom.

Right.

Just five that just just to find out.

And then we've got the oncologist.

And, you know, obviously, I'm not going to talk too many details with everything because

it's not appropriate, but we're going to see because dogs tend to do well on chemo,

you know, with that for depending if it's B cell or T cell.

And we're going to see what the doctor says, depending on the type it is and make decisions

from there.

But there's a good chance we could give them another month or two.

A good quality life.

And that would be a great opportunity because, you know, if the move isn't too stressful

for him, he gets to spend the holidays with the kids.

You know what I mean?

And he gets to experience a cold holiday for the first time and everything like that.

And so, you know, it's one of things where it's horrible that this happened, but I'm

kind of glad it did a little bit because while I feel guilty that I all the times I didn't

take him to the park or I didn't do this or I didn't, you know, I got upset at him because

he.

He was chewing a toy or he was doing something, you know, whatever, you know, you know, you

think about that.

But then I think to myself, as bad as this is, it was going to happen eventually, but

at least I can make the best of it and I can make sure that whatever time left is not it.

We have some and we can really make the best of it.

And we're hoping for that.

And so, you know, obviously we got to think about these things because there's a financial

thing there, but there's also our boy, you know, and so there's a lot that goes into

that.

I want to talk about all of it right now because it's a personal thing we're doing with the

family.

But but yeah, so you can always look at things.

Differently, you know, you know, it's it's like it's like, you know, he's, you know,

if everything goes well and we can, you know, you know, have a, you know, because I'm going

to push it off just just to for our own sake, you know, we want to think about him, too.

But if it goes through, it's like, all right, let's let's make sure that we give him the

best we can.

You know, I mean, because he was there for for us, you know what I mean?

And he was he you know, I don't I don't keep talking about this because I'm not I'm mentally

not I'm going to fucking lose my shit.

So but you know what I mean?

Like and so so yeah, so you can look at things in a different way.

You can look at.

I'm in a positive.

You can look at him as a negative.

All right.

We all got those things going on.

All right.

For those of you guys who've never owned a pet, you know, I get why it doesn't make sense

to a lot of people because they're like, wait, it's just this or just that.

And to other people who understand that these things are financial decisions, they are.

And there's also an emotional thing there.

You have to be adults and you have to make decisions.

And it's very, very difficult because it's very, very difficult to to think, oh, anything

is not worth X, Y, Z.

But you've got to think that there is a life after that.

And you've got to make sure you don't set that rest of your life back for a short term

thing.

I'm not talking about Bayo necessarily.

I'm saying for those out there who who have these decisions, sometimes we think emotionally

and we think, you know, OK, well, if I do this, I don't care how much it costs or how

much this is.

You know, that's my whatever.

And it's like, but, you know, you've got to think about the time you think about your

life after that and what what what affects you there.

And I know it's a very deep conversation, but this is what I do.

I talk about money.

I talk about personal finances.

And it's uncomfortable.

But it doesn't just because something's uncomfortable doesn't mean you can't talk about it.

And so, you know, you you as a as a person have to make those decisions.

Right.

And right now we don't have anything to worry about because we're we're going to take him

to the oncologist tomorrow.

We're going to find out what what what what the the you know, the possibilities are and

what we can expect one way or the other.

And, you know, we have to make those decisions.

But it's very difficult.

It's a decision we don't want to make.

But the reason I talk about it is I want you guys to at least start thinking about these

kind of financial decisions.

Before you get to them, because if you're not prepared and you get there, you make emotional

decisions and motions and money never mix.

So you have to be realistic with yourself.

You know what I mean?

So I want you guys to just think about those things.

I'm talking about Bayo.

I'm talking about you guys in your life and how it goes.

Some people get their emotions run high.

They'll bankrupt themselves.

They won't be thinking, you know, you've got to make very tough decisions, but you also

want to make sure that you make the right ones.

OK.

OK.

It's very, very difficult.

But and I know you guys aren't ready for this.

I don't want to have this type of conversation on a Monday morning, but I don't care.

I have to talk about these things.

I would be I would be disingenuous if I didn't talk about these things when it comes to personal

finance, even when it affects me.

You see what I mean?

Because we all have to we're all going to face these kinds of things, whether it's

family, whether it's friends, whether it's through through through pets, you know, and

some people, their pets are closer than their own family.

You know what I mean?

And it's not an easy decision.

And we make jokes.

We make jokes about things and we laugh about things and we talk about them because it's

easier to make light of situations than it is to get into them.

But as long as we're talking about them, you know what I mean?

And I feel like nobody wants to have that conversation.

Nobody wants to have that conversation.

But when you reach that, if you reach that spot in your life and you're faced with it

and no one ever had that conversation with you, then then you don't know what to do and

you only drive off of emotion and you can oftentimes make very big mistakes.

And so I want to be the person who talks about things that are uncomfortable, even if it's

even if it's hitting home for me.

And hurting me very badly.

I still need to talk about it.

There's no better time for me to talk about it than when I'm dealing with it personally,

because because, you know, then, you know, it's not just me saying it for clicks or for,

you know, whatever.

It's it's raw.

You know what I mean?

It's it's it's real.

And I want to talk about those things with you guys.

OK, and it's one of the things where you have to prepare.

You know, I mean, you know, when you when you get a pet, OK, when you get a pet, any

type of animal, you know, you're going to outlive that animal.

It's hard to remember that.

And every time I do, I have had to let go.

I promised myself I'm never going to do it again.

But then I remember what it's like to have someone or something that loves you unconditionally.

And I do it all over again.

And you know what?

God damn, is it worth it?

It's a pain that I'm willing to go through.

It really is, because it's not even selfish.

It's just it's just.

And no matter what someone, something is happy to see me and doesn't care if I made money

or we're in debt or we're doing well or we're stressed or you're going through a medical

condition where you want to just you don't want to move and you just wish it would stop.

Guess who comes and lifts your puts her little nose under you and actually make sure you're

OK.

Guess who's there?

No matter if you left the house for five minutes or five days, guess who's fucking losing their

goddamn mind at your home?

Right.

But that's a hard conversation and a hard thing to deal with because you don't want to let them go.

But at the same time, you've got to respect them and you've got to think about life after them.

What you know, it's easy to quantify it from a market standpoint.

If it costs fifty thousand dollars to give them another month or two, you know, right in your

mind, anything is worth it for my boy or my girl or you don't know how they're going to do.

They may not even have a great life.

And even if you do.

It's a hard thing to say, but is it really worth it?

Because you got to think about your family and your kids who are going to be there the rest of your life.

Life is going to start is going to continue to move on.

And sometimes you have to be dark about it.

And sometimes you have to say to yourself, really, Jake?

And, you know, the world is going to the sun's going to come up tomorrow.

The world's going to keep spinning.

So think about that.

OK, it's the same thing when we have family members that are towards the end of their life or that are suffering.

Sometimes we think the same thing.

So.

Well, I'm dealing with this.

I mean, financially, it's already zapped everything.

I just, you know, I mean, potentially continue.

And I told I told my wife, I said, I'll go to the oncologist with you because I can't.

She's not ready to have this conversation.

And so I'm going to go with her.

And she's very hopeful.

She's saying, well, with this treatment and if it's this, it could last this long.

And I want to support her.

I'm going to go to oncologist.

We're going to go through it.

But there's also an understanding that, you know what I mean?

Hey, what are you doing?

Who's a good boy?

So how old is he?

He's seven.

The best thing about this community is you can make lighthearted jokes while talking about super something super serious.

The D-gens are great because we have to be adults about everything.

You have to.

Whether or not you talk about something doesn't change it.

If you could ignore something and then it would make it go away.

Cool.

But you have it doesn't not talking about something doesn't.

Make it go away.

Being prepared for something is the most powerful thing you can do.

You may not want something to happen but you need to be prepared for it.

No.

Fuck you seven.

Okay, okay, you need to be prepared.

You need to be prepared.

I have had everything taken from me.

You know, I mean, I'm almost numb to life.

But guess what?

Just when you think that it's not true.

You have to be prepared for things.

I don't want you guys to be depressed.

I don't.

I don't want you guys to go through the world fucking like sad and miserable.

But I want you guys to say, hey, listen, I hope this doesn't happen or I don't want this

to happen.

But in case it does, because the worst thing you can do is not be prepared for a big moment.

And I think a lot of times we just don't want to think about it because it makes it.

I just don't want to think about it because it's a negative thing.

I get it.

I get it.

But how many of you motherfuckers right now are married, have children and don't have

life insurance?

Well, I'm 30 years old.

I'm very healthy.

I don't have to worry about it.

Right.

Think about that.

How many of you haven't written a will?

Oh, I'm 36 years old and my kids are small.

I don't have to worry about that.

Life insurance is a scam.

OK, buddy, let's see how your family deals with it.

If you're the breadwinner and you lose out, it's it's I get that life insurance is a

bullshit thing.

Term life insurance is probably better.

But let me tell you something right now.

If you don't have family or assets or something that your family have, you could literally

put your your family in lifelong debt.

Especially if your spouse doesn't work or doesn't make enough to cover.

OK, I'm not I'm just saying like I'm moving on from this to have a serious conversation.

This non savant brand of tism is so strong in Stocky's chat room.

Welcome in first time chatter.

Parktime guy, an ecologist just resubbed for 17.

Life insurance is not needed after a certain level of wealth.

Exactly.

Exactly.

I'm not saying for everybody.

I'm just saying we the amount of people in here who haven't taken a video of the inside

of their home in case there's a fire so that they can claim it.

They don't realize they're going to they're going to miss out on hundreds of thousands

of dollars.

Because the insurance company is going to scam them.

And I'm teaching you the one fucking trick that that can help you when that happens.

Nobody expects a fire in their house.

How many of you guys haven't replaced the batteries in your in your in your in your

smoke detector?

Right.

I'll do it later.

I'll do it later.

How many of you guys either don't have a fire extinguisher in your in your in your

kitchen and in your computer room or have one that's expired or have one you don't even

know if it's the right one?

I guarantee you probably don't have the right one in your computer room.

Right.

So we don't have those things.

And then it's too late.

Oh, I'll just deal with it later.

And then it's too late.

It's like, oh, fuck, I wish I would have done it.

Why didn't somebody tell me to do it or why did I put it off?

I've been doing that all week this weekend between what happened with him and everything

else.

I just I just my brain just collapsed.

My brain just collapsed.

I just I went numb this weekend and I started beating myself up looking around the house.

I'm like, how did I not fix that toilet seat for the last two years?

You're telling me the last two years I didn't have enough time to go fix that toilet seat

and they started adding it up the hole in the wall from the kids hitting the baby gate,

the thing behind the fridge, the lock on the back door.

And I just started walking around the house beating myself up because I'm like,

how did I not get these things done?

I remember that I have severe ADHD and I can't like if I don't do something immediately,

I don't get it done.

But I'm like, how did I not do that?

How did I not take more time to spend with my son, you know, or my dog or whatever?

And I'm beating myself up and I'm overdoing it.

But it's kind of one of those things where when you're going through a deep spot, you

kind of do that.

But then I have to sit back and say, OK, let's do this.

And so what I'm doing is, is I'm using this moment with with bail to remind myself that

I really, really, really, really.

Need to put my phone down.

I need to be more present in life.

That is I think that's the number one thing I have to do is be more present in life.

I feel like I get distracted easy.

My phone is that is that catalyst something breaking news comes up about the.

OK, everybody's getting bored now.

OK, I'll shut up.

All right.

No, I'm not a social media addict.

It's not even social media.

My I went through my screen time thing and one third of all screen time I have is on

financial stuff, whether it's through my brokerage, whether it's through financial news,

something that one third of all my screen time.

It's.

The financials.

The other third is through discord.

All right.

I'll shut the fuck up.

Let's do marbles and then we'll get into some fun shit.

OK, I appreciate the chat.

I know it's it's it's tough to have these talks.

It really is.

But but but but somebody has to because if if if nobody does, then then we're all kind

of just sitting back, kind of like going, you know, why didn't I know about this or

why didn't somebody tell me about this?

And, you know, it is what it is.

I don't want you guys getting caught up with that.

All right.

OK, I.

I know it's not popular and it's not fun to talk about these things, but they still

have to get talked about.

And, you know, one thing about my stream is that you guys always say, oh, Saki, you're

too transparent.

You're too open.

We don't care that much about all the shit going on with you.

But I like to talk about it because other people are have or will go through the same

things.

And and and and, you know, we all want to act like, oh, well, we know what we're doing,

but sometimes we're just lost.

And sometimes seeing somebody else go through it and being open about it can help us when

we potentially.

Hit that same hit the same struggles and, you know, you know, you know, my mistakes

can can often be other people's, you know, accidental, like, I don't know, like accidental

help.

I hope they will recovers and have many more happy years.

No, that's not possible.

The real life shit that doesn't get talked about enough for people who aren't prepared

for life.

So I appreciate the rant, man.

Love to listen.

Yeah.

Again, again, first off, first time chatter.

I got to ban you for saying nice things.

But, you know, it's it.

I.

I.

I've had to live life.

I've had to live life on basically on my own my whole life.

And I've made a lot of mistakes.

I had to learn a lot of things.

And it was like this weekend.

I just wanted somebody to talk to.

I didn't have anybody to talk to.

I just really wanted to just vent.

You know, I mean, and I think that a lot of us like, you know, like it's really.

It's really tough, but you don't want to vent because number one, like me, it's hard to

vent because, you know, people are going to say, oh, well, I have this or you're not.

You don't have to deal with this or imagine this.

It was just like kind of sad.

You know, it was kind of like, fuck, you know, and so, you know, we all have to go

through that.

And I'm not venting to you guys at all.

I'm not even talking about this.

I'm just having this conversation.

But like, you know, sometimes we feel like a little like we're doing it not alone, but

you know, it's it's tough.

It's tough.

So I want people to understand that, like, these things happen.

Life happens.

This is the last thing I'll say about it.

When things like this happen, especially a move.

Right.

Every time you move, you ever look around your house and say, remember when we did this?

Remember when this happened?

And you're like, wow, that was so long ago.

Or, man, why don't we do this more often?

How come we didn't do that?

Oftentimes we wait until we're about to lose something before we appreciate it.

Everything in life, a house, a pet, a family member.

And you can't make every day precious and you can't be guilty about everything you missed.

But life goes fast.

And one thing about getting older that you learn is that it's at a certain point, life

stops giving you things and starts taking things away.

So remember that.

OK.

OK.

You're super deep.

Funny, your mom said the same thing.

Let's do Marvel's assholes.

Let's go.

This is Twitch.

You should be doing speed runs and getting canceled.

What are you talking about?

Bob Ross sounding motherfucker.

OK.

Oh, happy little accidents.

All right.

Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.

What?

Oh, what?

No, fuck it.

No, hell no.

Why is that even in my thing?

Oh, my God.

Oh, I'm glad that stopped.

I just got back.

This is so bad that I can't even listen to it.

This is better.

It's a different kind of worse.

Different kind of bad.

Am I allowed to play even though I'm banned for saying nice things?

Yes.

All right, let's run it.

Where does the time go?

Where does the time go?

I've been thinking about that a lot this weekend.

Yeah, I know.

My energy is off today, guys.

I know.

I'm killing the mood today.

Sometimes it's good to just have reminders.

I needed this stream more than I think anybody this morning.

I needed some normalcy.

Who do you use for pet insurance?

We had one through VCA.

I told you guys I know this is a stock stream, but I'm always going to talk about real things.

It's very important that we do that.

Yes.

Because we don't get to talk about it enough

because there's nobody to talk to right now.

Yo.

World record again.

So many world records in here.

Who's the guy in the bottom right?

That was me when I did a photo shoot for Home Depot back in 2008.

A stock photo for the stock guy.

The 2008 fall off.

I think myself and the economy fell off at the same time.

Alright, let's get back to it.

Alright.

Alright, Qualcomm, what a play there.

Netflix bounced back nicely.

We got stopped out of the rest of the PayPal.

It was a nice little scalp there.

Rum is just not moving.

I don't know if this is going to be later in the day

or if it's just not going to move.

I'm still in it, but I'm just kind of waiting to see.

I lagged back at the shares of NNE that we sold on Friday.

I bought back in at $42.50.

Well, $42.50, $46.

And I'll buy more if it goes to $40.

I like to play it up and down.

So, this has been nice.

Really good when we got it in $36.

We played it.

Playing it again here.

If NVX goes under $170, I might add to it as well.

I'm going to buy some shares of MO in my long term.

I'm going to buy like two shares now.

I like to add a couple every time it goes under certain levels.

And it's a good divvy one for me.

So, I'm going to add that.

Ford, we're doing really good on.

I don't really see anything else I want to play.

We had some good plays pre-market.

Saki, the next time you do a collab,

to explain something going on in a market you don't understand,

can you please choose anybody else but a Zoomer?

What are you talking about?

You're talking about the CS thing?

Oh, shit.

AMD going.

I had 400 shares of AMD at one point.

Now, I only have 150 left.

The CSGO market thing?

I don't, you know, I wanted to get, you know,

somebody that could maybe explain it to me.

I actually did my own research after the stream

and kind of understood it.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I understood it more as far as, like, basically, you know,

these things that were worthless are now able to be used

to get something that you used to have to pay a lot of money for.

So, it significantly lowered the value of the thing you can use them to get

and increased the value of the thing that was worthless before.

That's kind of, if somebody would have said that,

I kind of would have got it.

But I was trying to get somebody.

Because I'm one of those people where if I don't understand something,

I don't want to pretend like I do.

So, I want to get people that may be more, you know,

you know, in tune with it.

I just don't think that that guy was, like, used to,

ready to explain it to a bunch of people that are, like,

understand the stock market.

Because he kind of explained it to a bunch of people

that understand that market better.

Maker-only, I man just resubbed for 14 months.

14 months.

Wow.

You are genuinely the only streamer I have ever given money to.

No regrets, much love.

All right.

Well, keep giving me your money.

God knows I fucking need it right now.

I'm kidding.

Don't give me your fucking money.

You weirdo.

He explained it badly regardless.

No hate.

Oh, no, no, no.

It's not that.

It's just that was the only person that I could get.

And I never met the guy.

I, you know, I appreciate him taking the time to try to explain it to us.

It's like me trying to explain something to somebody I don't understand.

Although the funniest part of that whole interaction was how much his chat

lost their fucking minds when I compared it to NFTs.

I could not believe how upset people got.

They, they, it was like, it was like, it was as though I,

I, I, I don't know.

It was as though I had just told them like that.

I don't know that they're adopted or some shit like that was crazy.

And I understand that they were upset about it.

Like, I mean, you know, anybody who feels like they're there,

somebody is like poking fun at their world,

even though that wasn't what I was doing.

But they, they really, really, really were not happy with,

with, with me comparing it to, to NFTs.

That was a bit, and it wasn't me trying to be mean.

It was like,

these are non-fungible items.

Like they're not real world items.

So comparing it to NFTs is not necessarily incorrect completely because it is,

you know, an, a, a, a, you know, a, a non-fungible, you know, digital item.

And, you know, it's not something that you can, you can take on the,

you know, but it doesn't mean it's not value.

There's a, there's a marketplace for it.

There's a supply and demand and there's people that own it and consolidate it.

So again, that was it.

But then when I said the thing about the, the, the, the tulip mania,

which is a thing that we've talked about in this,

this channel a million times, more people got upset,

more people got upset because they're like, you can't, you know,

I think if people invest in something and they have money in it,

they automatically get that emotional.

Like there is no,

you can't compare this to something else because this is real or this is more

legit than that thing.

And I think we go through that cycle with a lot of things,

baseball cards in the nineties, for those of you guys that are boomers,

you'll remember in the nineties, baseball cards were the big thing.

Right.

And it all came down when we found out about Ken Griffey Jr.

So for those of you guys who don't know,

it's not the only catalyst, but this is what happened in the nineties.

So, you know, and people say, well, it'll never happen with this,

this card or this thing.

So we all know about beanie babies, right?

We all know about beanie babies, right?

Okay.

And now we've got that 2.0 with LaBubu's.

Okay.

There are people that are legitimately buying it for, for status symbols.

Other people are buying it for what they think is an investment,

buy and sell it.

But in the nineties you had,

you had the baseball cards,

baseball cards and baseball cards in the nineties were huge.

I remember in the late nineties, early two thousands, how it was.

I had a Mark McGuire rookie card from when he was at the athletics that I had.

And I watched as him and Sammy Sosa went head to head for the home run record.

And when Mark McGuire broke the record,

I was holding my card thinking this is going to be huge one day.

It's going to be huge one day.

And I was like, this is going to be insane.

And I,

I probably could have sold it at that time for a lot of money,

especially for somebody who was like 12 or 13 years old.

Like it was a lot of money.

And I was like,

this is going to be something went to 70 home runs.

It was all this stuff.

Well, two things happen.

One, they all got busted for steroids.

And number two,

the card market collapsed.

Why did the card market collapse?

So you saw baseball cards go crazy,

right?

And it all started because of the,

it will always like the,

the peak of it was the Ken Griffey,

Jr.

The Ken Griffey Jr.

Rookie.

And the Ken Griffey Jr.

Rookie card,

was the,

the prized card.

Those were the good ones.

And there was only a few of them out there.

And it was,

it was fueling this market.

And then because of that,

other people started like buying other cards up.

And when other people started buying other cards,

they were looking for rare cards.

They were looking for specific cards and they were running,

they were running.

It was going wild.

Yeah.

You all remember that?

And then it turned out that there was a shitload of Ken Griffey Jr.

Cards.

They were just being held back.

And so the company,

I think it was tops or whoever it was that,

that had the,

the valuable one.

Apparently,

there was a ton of them and they had them.

They just hadn't released them all yet.

And it turned out that it was manufactured demand or supply.

And once it got out,

people started capitulating.

They started trying to dump it.

Right.

And nobody wanted it.

And so when they started dumping this one,

all the other ones started dumping as well.

And we went 20 years with a flat mark card market.

And the crazy thing is,

is that all of those cards that were worth so much at that time,

are all worthless.

Now those didn't even come back.

It's like diamonds in the manufactured scarcity,

right?

Did beers and the whole thing.

I've talked about diamonds guys with how,

how that's all been manufactured,

right?

With,

um,

with how this was like they're they,

they basically did a huge campaign.

They laid 1800s early 1900s to make diamonds are what make you a man.

And you've got to have this much money and she,

she deserves a diamond and all this stuff like this.

And there's very few of them and whatever,

even though they had tons of it,

they bought up all the diamond mines and just basically mind them and hid them.

And made it seem like they were very scarce when they weren't now.

They're fucked because a lab grown in moist tonight,

but that's what happened.

And these cards never came back.

People were like,

Oh,

well it's like the market just wait,

it'll come back.

These cards never came back.

I have cards up in the attic right now.

I have to go through it.

I mean,

I may have very valuable cards,

but I stopped collecting cards in the,

in the,

in the early two thousands,

late nineties,

early two thousands.

So all those cars probably are worthless.

And so that's what happened.

It just takes one thing.

Now,

tulip mania.

I've talked about this before.

The first ever,

uh,

manipulative bubble pump and dump in recorded history was the tulip mania.

This is why I say you can never trust the Dutch.

You can never trust the Dutch for two reasons.

Number one,

they created the first pump and dump.

And number two,

they're the reason that we had the American or the,

the Boston tea party.

That's right.

I've told you the history.

Okay.

I don't think I need to do it a war,

a whiteboard on it again,

but the Boston tea party,

you've been lied to.

It wasn't a bunch of fucking American Patriots that went and dumped British tea into the,

into the,

uh,

into the Harbor.

It was a bunch of black market,

fucking bootleg,

beggars that,

that,

that,

that the mafia,

the early,

the early American mafia that dumped a bunch of Dutch tea in the Harbor.

And I can talk about that another time if I need to.

Okay.

All right.

But here's the thing.

Tulip mania.

For those of you guys who don't know.

Okay.

Here you go.

Tulip mania in the early 1600s.

Okay.

All of a sudden,

uh,

in,

in,

in,

in the Netherlands,

the fucking tulips came,

right?

The fucking tulips,

right?

I'm not,

I'm not good at drawing tulips,

but these,

these,

these,

these beautiful tulips,

whatever they come in and you can't grow them there,

right?

From Turkey and from,

from,

from that area.

And so they start importing a couple of these and all of a sudden they're this exotic flower

that doesn't grow there,

but they're very,

they're very scarce because they have to be brought from these people on these trains,

these,

these,

these,

these,

these wagon trains and these merchants that take a long time.

And remember back then merchants,

it was very,

it was very dangerous for them to,

to,

to get there,

right?

It took them months to get there.

They had to go through mountains and,

and they had to go through snow storms and they had to go through,

you know,

deserts.

They had to go,

they had to fight off fucking bandits.

They had to worry about getting diseased.

And stuff.

So it was a lot to get it over there and they get these bulbs,

right?

They get these,

these tulip bulbs and they bring them over there and they're very,

they're very rare flowers,

you know,

and they're very beautiful,

but all of a sudden the Royal started getting them,

right?

Like it was a status symbol.

The only people that could get tulips and these things take upwards of seven years for

them to bloom and then make new bulbs.

So it wasn't something that was easy to manipulate,

easy to get,

but the Royal started using them in the palaces and stuff.

And so they were status symbol.

So rich people started,

wanting to get tulips.

And so they started buying these tulip bulbs and then there was this weird disease

that happened.

It hit all the tulip bulbs and all of a sudden it made these beautiful colors on

the tulip leaves,

right?

So they had all these,

these,

these,

these,

these crazy colors.

It was like these,

these like lightning patterns and some of them were like half orange and half,

you know,

yellow.

So these were like super rare,

right?

Like the super rare Pokemon cards,

right?

And so now all of a sudden this becomes a frenzy and they started trading them on

the fucking futures market.

So what happened was,

is,

they bring these tulip bulbs and they don't,

they're not even in the ground yet.

People are trading futures on ones that haven't been planted yet and the

offspring of those.

And it started out in these fucking taverns,

right?

People would go into these taverns,

right?

And then we're getting these big tables and they would have these pieces of

paper.

I'll put two lips on your organ to show you that I'm true.

I'll put two lips on your organ.

Grow the fuck up.

So now they're in these taverns and these guys are,

these haven't even,

they haven't even seen the bulbs.

The bulbs are,

are,

are somewhere else or they've just been planted or they're on the way and they

start trading futures contracts.

They start trading futures contracts.

And so it starts out where people are like,

okay,

you can have this bulb if it's,

you know,

worth,

you know,

I'll give it to you this way.

It'll be worth a day's labor.

And some guys like,

all right.

And then as he gets the contract,

he walks to the,

he walks to the other table and says,

all right,

I got this one right here,

guys.

Who wants it?

It'll be two days labor.

And some guys like,

fuck it,

I'll do it.

And this kept going and it kept going.

And the value of these tulip bulbs,

some of them,

again,

these are futures contracts.

None of these people have seen the bulbs.

Okay.

None of these guys have seen the bulbs and the futures contracts start going

until we're at a peak where people are trading their fucking mansions.

Okay.

On the goddamn water.

Okay.

This is like,

they start,

they start working their way up from like,

uh,

uh,

one week's labor to a fucking oxen to a fucking,

uh,

like two acres of land to like their wife or their child or some shit.

And it works their way up until people are trading them for homes.

At one point,

there were bulbs that were traded for 10 years salary for some people,

all because this was some kind of like,

the next big thing.

And that the Royals are going to pay them more money for it.

And eventually everyone's going to do it.

And then one day,

one day,

I remember this has been traded to the future.

The piece of paper that guarantees you the bulb has been traded.

The actual bulb has never even crossed hands.

Then one day,

I think 1637,

whatever it was,

1634 or seven.

I can't remember.

It's in the 1630s.

There's an auction.

Now this has been happening in,

in,

in,

in,

you know,

taverns and brothels and shit.

But finally,

there's an auction and it goes to the auction.

And the auctioneer is sitting up there.

Right.

And he's sitting up there.

He's got his little hammer.

He's got his like long wig because they all wore that crazy shit.

And there's all these people sitting here.

Right.

And they're auctioning off all kinds of stuff.

And then there's an auction and they start the bidding on the bulb and no one bids it.

It's like the bid.

It's like the price of a house.

So they lower the bid.

No one bids.

And they keep lowering.

And lowering.

And now people that were in the crowd that were thinking about buying it a little lower,

like,

huh,

I wonder if this keeps falling.

Maybe I can get it cheaper.

And it kept falling and falling and falling.

And it didn't get sold.

Everyone started freaking out.

So now all of these people who had traded their homes,

their oxen,

their families,

their fucking,

they were actually trading boats and ships and stuff.

We're like,

oh shit,

I fucked up.

Imagine going to your wife in the 1600s.

Right?

And like saying,

you know,

I don't know how Dutch people sound in the 1600s,

but it's probably like,

which is translated to my dear.

I have an opportunity.

Okay.

Hear me out.

Okay.

My dearest love.

We no longer own our home.

We must now live in a shack,

but we have a tulip bulb and we will trade it for a palace.

And then the next day,

it's fucking,

it's all gone.

Poof.

It's fucking gone.

And so the price of a tulip bulb in a matter of like five years went from like,

you know,

zero to a fucking mansion,

right?

To the price of a fucking onion.

And everyone lost everything.

Now,

the good news is,

and this is where my anti-capitalist people can,

can,

can,

can put a fist up in the air.

Mostly,

it was just the wealthiest that lost.

Everything.

The funny thing is,

is all the people on the way up actually made a lot of money.

This is while this is the first pump and dump.

This is one of the greatest accidental transfers of wealth in,

uh,

in modern history,

because some of these people were trading like their oxen.

And then like within five minutes,

they,

they,

they,

they,

they didn't have to lose.

They,

they didn't lose their oxen,

but they gained a fucking like acre of land.

And then an acre of land got traded for like a house.

And then a house got traded for like a fucking like boat and shit like that.

And so in some cases,

the people who,

who lost the most were already wealthy.

They got wiped out.

So some people actually made off pretty well on this,

but that was the first official pump and dump.

Now I know I'm not like all pumped up today and excited to do my whiteboard,

you know,

like get all crazy,

but this is,

this is the first pump and dump.

So whenever you hear about tulip mania,

this is basically what happened.

It was,

it was a speculative fucking bubble that happened off of even a real world,

a tangible item,

but there was no real value.

And it was just this idea that it was just going to keep going up forever.

Okay.

There was nothing real.

There was nothing real about it.

It was just a fucking thing.

And now the crazy thing is,

is that all the tulips,

whenever you think of tulips,

you actually think of the Netherlands.

So they're even worth less now.

Okay.

I thought slavery was the first pump and dump.

No,

it didn't really lose.

Like I know this sounds horrible,

but it didn't lose its real value until it was,

it was,

it was outlawed.

I'm not used to stocky saying tulips and not making a sex joke.

Not really feeling it.

I thought chatter thought he was cooking with that one.

Yeah,

no pump and dump is generally means like there's an out.

There's like a,

um,

there's like a,

a manufactured value on something that doesn't have any real world value.

And then it's all speculation.

And then it falls outlawed.

Well,

I meant in the United States.

I mean,

you know,

obviously people are going to say,

you know,

well,

technically there's still a form of slavery going on and there's still

slavery around the world.

Yes.

I understand what you mean,

but like as far as a pump and dump,

now there are other pump and dumps that have happened,

you know,

in,

in,

in the past and stuff like that.

A lot of them,

the Dutch were behind as well.

Uh,

but,

uh,

I always think of the,

the tulip mania because it's so funny because it was off of a single

flower and the speculation.

And it was a futures market that was happening like in,

in bugging like taverns and in,

uh,

brothels and stuff.

And people hadn't,

didn't even see it.

Right.

It was like the piece of the futures contract.

Do you think Bitcoin can be like a tulip mania?

Not in the same way.

Um,

because,

because with Bitcoin,

there is a,

there is a lot of number one,

there's institutional ownership,

but also there's a lot of people that,

that,

that,

that believe that it's going to be a store of value and not just,

you know,

buying it to sell it higher.

I mean,

most people probably are,

but there are some people out there who still think that that's going to

be the alternative or the store of value against the currencies and stuff

like that.

I'm still,

you know,

on the fence with that.

I think,

I think anybody with,

with,

with a brain is also,

should also be weary that that is going to be the case because of the

way that the world works and because of,

of,

of,

you know,

the,

the,

the fungibility of it.

Um,

but,

uh,

I,

I wouldn't say it's like tulips in any way.

No,

I think tulips are more like NFTs,

right.

Or,

or,

or like a meme coins where it's a bot that buys them all up.

And then there's like a,

a manufactured,

um,

a manufactured,

uh,

demand.

And then it skyrockets the price and then someone liquidates and stuff

like that.

I think it's a big difference.

Was there institutional ownership with tulips?

No,

not really.

Why are we whiteboarding a wrestling event?

It's not a rest.

Are you in gold?

No,

but we got into a junior miners,

um,

at the beginning of the year,

we got into J nug at the beginning of the year to,

because we,

we saw the divergence between gold and miners and figured one would have

to,

uh,

uh,

uh,

reach the other,

either come down,

a goal will have to come down or miners would have to go up.

So we,

we just went,

we went into miners this morning.

This,

this,

uh,

earlier this year,

it's been really good run.

All right.

Qualcomm given some of it back.

Hmm.

I wonder if I should run PayPal again.

We made some decent money off of it.

Oh,

nevermind.

We're still in the other half.

Nothing got stopped out yet.

Um,

okay.

Oh shit.

R finally moving a little bit.

I'm actually up 90% of my remaining calls on R.

That's nice.

I was getting beat up.

Um,

first day I took them.

Yeah.

There's a lot of earnings this week.

A lot of people,

we're going to lose a lot of good people.

We're going to lose a lot of good people in this community.

There's always somebody who goes a little too hard on earnings.

We've got some serious ones this week.

We got tomorrow morning.

Sofi,

PayPal,

UPS,

Corning,

JetBlue.

Then the crazy thing is,

is that we don't,

we normally spread them out over two weeks,

but in two days we've got Wednesday after hours.

And this comes after the fed rate decision to meta Microsoft and Google Wednesday after

close Amazon,

Apple,

Coinbase,

Reddit after,

uh,

close on Thursday.

I think it's cool.

Everyone loves wealth here.

I mean,

I wouldn't say everybody loves wealth.

I think everybody loves,

loves,

um,

at least a wealth of knowledge.

Even if you don't,

you know,

most of the people here don't even actively trade stocks.

And I mean,

I do,

but like a fun day trade for the fun bit of my money and swing trade with a

decent size.

But most of it's long term investing.

I think people just like to learn about this stuff or keep up with it and keep up

with the news or be knowledgeable about it.

Even if you don't do something,

being knowledgeable about it is good.

And,

and if something affects you regardless,

it's good to know what's going on.

Plus we do a lot of memes and jokes and,

and,

and shit like that.

I have interviews,

so this helps a lot of people,

a lot of people here just like having,

uh,

you know,

being able to have conversations with people and like kind of understand

what's going on or,

you know,

be able to talk about stuff.

Um,

you know,

it's cool when,

when,

when,

when somebody has a conversation about the economy and you're like,

you kind of know what's going on because you kind of keep up with it.

And if it's something that seems complicated,

but there's some idiot on Twitch who can break it down in a more like

manageable or more easy,

understand thing.

It's kind of cool to,

to,

to have that,

not to try to impress people,

but just to be,

you know,

relevant,

have relevant,

uh,

you know,

a meaningful part of a conversation.

Um,

you know,

I have to remember sometimes to,

to,

to cool it though.

When I'm talking about something,

cause somebody will ask a question or we'll be talking about something.

And then I just go into one of like stocky explanations about something.

They're like,

you okay,

buddy?

I'm like,

Oh yeah,

yeah.

I,

I meant,

um,

yeah.

Um,

uh,

Mark,

it's not the economy.

And then they're like,

I'd like to ask what you mean by that,

but I'm afraid to.

Yeah.

We got FOMC on Wednesday.

We got earnings this week.

We got Trump and she,

and the whole thing with,

uh,

with the,

with the trade deal.

So for those of you guys that weren't in the call this morning,

we talked about,

uh,

Besson saying that Trump's threat of a hundred percent tariffs on China is now

off the table that China expects to resume substantial us soybean purchases.

And Beijing is delaying the rare earth export controls by one year.

That's why you're seeing rare earth fall off.

We talked about this on the weekend that if the talks go well,

rare earth is going to fall off.

If it doesn't go well,

they're going to bounce back up.

However,

Trump still has to meet with she,

this is just a preliminary.

So if there is any flip flop or any,

you know,

concern about,

uh,

about,

uh,

the way that they,

uh,

they're doing this or Trump gets offended and says something,

we could see them pop right back up again.

So again,

be very,

very weary that,

uh,

this is all,

you know,

speculative right here.

However,

I learned something today when I was doing my news and I,

uh,

Besson said that he,

he's a soybean farmer.

How did I not know that he was a soybean farmer?

I feel like this isn't true.

Martha,

in case you don't know,

I'm actually a soybean farmer.

So I felt this pain too.

I mean,

is he talking about like one of those like mobile farm games or is he like

investing in soybean farmers?

Like,

like how,

how do you,

how do you possibly call yourself a soybean farmer?

I did mean the second term.

I know they have met before.

The president has also said he does want,

just like it.

That's like her saying,

I don't smoke.

I've never smoked.

Farmers to be taken care of.

You did mention that China has been boycotting American soil.

Soybeans and American farmers have really suffered.

Do you see a real light at the end of the tunnel there?

They may allow soybeans again.

Well,

Martha,

in case you don't know it,

I'm actually a soybean farmer,

so I have,

I have felt this pain too.

You know,

and there are a couple of scientists myself here.

One,

the Chinese have substantially dropped their purchases to almost zero.

So they unfortunately have been using American farmers.

He,

but,

who are amongst president Trump's biggest supporters.

I think he had more than 90% support.

And then this was one of the biggest crops in 20 years.

Owns as much as 25 million worth of North Dakota corn and soybean farmland,

which he rents out for more than $1 million a year in income.

See,

this is that bullshit I'm talking about.

This is that bullshit I'm talking about.

Like everybody wants to pretend like,

like,

like,

like I,

I own $25 million worth of land that I rent out to soybean farmers.

And I make a million dollars a year in income from it.

You're not a soybean farmer,

dude.

You're not a soybean farmer.

There are farmers that rent out your land.

You're a goddamn like soy Lord or something like that.

Like,

but he can't come out and say,

um,

I,

I felt the impact because,

uh,

my rent is,

uh,

that I collect is not going to be,

uh,

might get delayed because the,

the,

the farmers who use my rent,

my land to rent soybeans,

um,

won't be able to pay my,

their bills to me.

Like they can't say that.

Hey buddy,

come,

come,

come.

Yeah,

I got to,

I got the superheroes.

Who's that?

Who's that one?

Yeah,

it's Hulk.

Who's that?

Captain America.

Who's that?

Iron man.

Who's that?

You tell me that store,

which one?

That's Thor.

That's not Batman.

That's Thor.

You want to go for a walk and see what you want to go see baby Jack.

You wanna go for a walk and go see baby Jack.

Yeah.

I'm so glad you got better looking buddy.

I was worried about you for a bit there.

Okay.

Go,

go,

go.

Got you.

You got your Crocs on.

Okay.

Go,

go,

go,

go get them.

Go get me his hair looking fresh.

He's not bald anymore.

God,

he was so ugly.

He was so fucking ugly.

I was so worried.

I was so worried about him.

I was like,

bro,

like I got to make sure that you're,

you're,

you got,

you got money when you're older because Jesus,

you're going to need it.

But he got better looking.

He was never ugly.

No,

he was ugly.

A lot of people won't admit when their babies in there are ugly.

And the funny thing is,

is that babies come out looking like,

like deformed little,

like,

hairless moles.

And then most babies are ugly,

but you parents don't see it.

And most people are too afraid to tell somebody their baby's ugly.

And it's totally cool.

Babies are not supposed to like babies are ugly.

They didn't come out all mushed up and shit.

Right.

And the problem was,

is that like six months in,

he was still busted.

And I was like,

fuck,

but he turned out to be better looking.

He just,

he just took a little while.

My daughter came out good looking because she had the,

the,

the giant that her,

you know,

her,

her eyebrows or whatever.

So her face looked,

you know,

whatever.

She was cute.

Not,

not like,

you know,

whatever,

but like,

but compared to him,

he was so busted,

but he got better now.

Took him a minute.

Yeah.

There's nothing wrong with that.

But you look like team wolf when you were born.

I don't know.

I looked weird as a kid though.

The gaming colony underscore just resubbed for 10 months.

Hey,

stocky,

this might be weird,

but you may have changed my whole life.

I was out of high school doing nothing for two years.

And now I'm in an accounting class doing nothing.

Instead,

stock hug.

My man,

my man.

I'm glad it's been a lot of people that have reached out that said that they

got into a career or something to do with finance.

And I'm like,

I might've ruined more lives than I helped,

but a lot of people,

a lot of people that,

that have been in this community decided they liked finance and economics and

have gone into that careful,

bro.

Accounting girls will ruin your life.

And I mean that like in the best possible way,

like they're freaks,

man.

And they,

and they,

but they,

they will destroy you,

bro.

Okay.

I'm telling you right now,

I'm telling you right now,

accounting girls are the wildest.

Like they're the kind of ones that were like,

you know,

very like nice in public and a very sweet,

but when they,

when you go home with them,

that door closes,

you're in bed.

You hear her to close the bedroom door.

You hear a lock.

And then like a button gets pressed and there's like a whole thing.

It turns with like toys and shit and like whips and chains and fucking you.

I'm telling you right now,

they're freaks,

dude.

They're crazy freaks.

Okay.

And they,

and they will,

they will ruin your life in the best possible way.

Best possible way.

Okay.

I'm telling you right now.

Okay.

Understand that if a girl tells you she's an accountant,

there's two sides to that right there.

I'm telling you right now that there is a behind closed doors.

It is a different world.

Okay.

All right.

Tell me right now.

Tell me I'm wrong.

Tell me I'm wrong.

Okay.

It's a,

this is a fact.

Ex-wife was an accountant.

You're not wrong.

Don't we have a woman CPA and discord?

She's out of your league,

bro.

I'm just saying like,

I'm not even,

I'm not even,

I'm not,

I'm not trying to be like that guy,

but like from my experience in life,

okay.

Girls who are accountants are just not the same person behind closed doors.

And that's okay.

That's cool.

But you need to be aware of that.

So many people go into that thinking,

Oh,

she's so sweet and she's quiet.

And,

and I love how she doesn't really talk about her,

you know,

accounting stuff.

Cause I don't really know it,

but it's really cool to know about this.

And it must be,

it must be such a boring job.

And so it is,

it is,

and she needs to get that adrenaline rush somewhere else.

And I'm telling you right now,

there's one place she gets it.

Okay.

That's it.

And if she's gay ladies who like,

who like women,

you know,

if you like,

if you like,

you know,

accounting girls,

gay accounting girls,

the same way they're going to do some crazy shit.

You may not be ready for that.

Okay.

But you also have to understand that going in because,

because,

you know,

where do you host a morning call in my backyard?

Oh yeah.

You ain't going to be able to lie about how big you are.

So you don't know,

to,

to decimal point.

Okay.

Don't,

don't,

don't,

you're going to be very honest because let me tell you something.

Accountants deal with liars all day long.

You ain't lying to them.

That's another thing.

Okay.

I'm telling you right now.

Nurses,

nah,

nurses just host.

Uh,

no accounting girls are freaks,

but they're also,

you cannot lie to them.

Don't try lying to them.

They already know you're lying before you did.

Don't,

don't mess with that.

Numbers.

Don't lie.

You're actually funny.

No,

I'm not looking.

Maybe forensic accountants are scary.

Oh no,

no,

no,

no,

no,

no,

no,

no.

Forensic accountants.

You can't mess with.

No,

no,

no,

no,

no,

no.

You,

I just won't give her my name or my address.

She already got that.

She already got that before you left it that in the morning or that night.

Don't,

don't even play with that.

You're locked in with that one.

You are fucked.

If you get in that one,

you better,

you better,

you better.

If you have a skeleton in your closet,

guess what?

It's hanging in your front yard.

Okay.

It's Halloween all year long.

Okay.

If you've got skeletons,

your accountants,

your forensic accountant girls that no,

no,

no.

They also like to dominate shit.

Okay.

They don't,

because once they know they have that information,

they know their value goes up.

They know they can,

they have you in their grasps.

Okay.

Forensic accounting girls.

If you like,

if you like a dominant mommy,

okay.

And she,

if she's into that shit,

then that's,

that's where you go,

but you ain't hiding shit and you ain't owning shit.

That is that you belong to her.

If you marry or date a forensic accountant,

you own you,

you,

you,

she owns you.

You belong to her in every aspect.

Understand that.

Okay.

I don't even know why we're talking about this right now.

Halloween all year long.

I'm sorry.

I don't know why I say the shit that I say.

It doesn't,

for those of you guys who are newer here,

I want you to know that when I say something,

I most likely,

it is a sentence that either I have never said or the world has never heard.

I have not thought about it.

I have not planned it.

It just comes out and I can't control that.

So if that's too much for you,

I don't know what to tell you.

How do you know this stocky?

Because you just pick up shit around as you,

as you,

as you're,

you know,

in the world.

Okay.

My bad.

I said something about accounting 10 minutes ago and here we are.

So we got the earnings also.

Yeah.

So Scott Bessett,

apparently,

uh,

owns,

uh,

owns farmers.

Uh,

and,

he's getting hit by this too.

Uh,

his,

uh,

his,

his word that I am also a,

uh,

soybean farmer is,

uh,

in my opinion,

disingenuous at best.

Uh,

I own $25 million worth of land that I leased out to soybean farmers that pay me a million

dollars a year in rent.

And,

uh,

uh,

I'm going to be hit by this because I may not collect my rent on time,

uh,

is what I'm hearing.

And that is why he is working so hard for this as well as Trump giving a bailout package

because Bessett got to get his money.

Uh,

he's worth $6,000.

He's worth $600 million,

by the way.

That's not the only soy thing he farms.

Wait,

nevermind.

Uh,

okay.

Uh,

this was a good talk this morning about management fees.

Uh,

by the way,

ladies and gentlemen,

the U.S. debt,

uh,

burden is now on track to overtake Italy's by the end of the decade.

Are you ready for this?

Are you guys ready for this?

We are now going to make Italy look,

um,

I don't want to say competent,

but,

but it is getting wild out there.

We've talked about government debt and public debt versus private debt and which one leads

more to economic things.

But now the U.S. government debt burden is now expected to go up 20 percentage points

by 20 to by 2030,

putting us at a debt to GDP ratio of 143%.

143% of debt to GDP.

You can thank the big,

beautiful bill.

That's one of the,

the many problems.

Yes.

It was a big problem,

but to think that whoever told you that that's the reason that's happening.

No,

that's just another big puck and problem.

This has been,

you don't get,

you don't get the 38 trillion,

uh,

in debt and 143% of debt to GDP by one single bill.

This has been,

this is,

this is just putting flame,

uh,

gas on the fire,

but it's been happening for a while.

Didn't Doge solve the debt problem?

No,

Doge found out too much.

The BBB is a disaster.

Oh,

fuck.

Yeah,

it is.

The last time I remember an admin making a big deal about paying down,

debt was under Clinton.

Yeah.

Well,

the Clinton administration,

a lot of people,

um,

give Clinton the credit for it.

Um,

but I think people misunderstand that Clinton was just the president at the

time.

This was actually something that was done,

um,

by,

by,

uh,

bipartisan agreement in Congress.

It was the last time we had Congress,

like both sides actually sit down and work out a deal and not just like play

the game of like,

everyone is going to die if you don't do exactly what I do.

Like Gingrich,

which he was a fucking piece of shit in his personal life.

And I was like,

but he actually worked together with some of the Democrats and they put in

policies that ended up fucking people down the line.

But you counter that and the.com boom that was happening at the same time in

the nineties.

So you had all this money coming into United States from the service sector

when,

when,

when Microsoft and,

and,

and,

and a lot of these other big companies were really pushing up.

Um,

and you,

you,

you get all of that,

especially because also people don't realize this,

but nobody wants to talk about all this shit because it's like,

it doesn't make it,

it's not sexy history,

but you do realize that the Gulf war was,

was to protect oil prices,

right?

Like what happened in the eighties with,

with,

with Carter and all that stuff like that.

And,

and oil prices spiking and causing this massive recession.

Once Iraq invaded into Kuwait,

the United States was like,

this is not fucking happening again.

Like we're not,

no,

fuck that.

You're not going to fuck with our oil prices again.

So we go in there and like stop Iraq and everything like that.

And basically take over control of a lot of the,

of their,

their,

their,

their resources in the short term.

But basically as a,

Hey,

we bailed you out.

Now you,

you owe us all this oil.

And,

and OPEC kind of like became more friendly to the U S in that,

in that way.

This was also the end of like the,

the,

the,

the,

the,

the,

the middle East league of nations kind of thing.

It was like the U S is there to kind of like bail them out,

whatever.

Long story short,

that kind of flowed cheap oil brought prices down.

Okay.

Because especially energy prices at the time,

which was huge because it also made it cheaper for,

you know,

everything else going on.

Then the U S started,

hadn't quite put their reliance on China yet,

but still had trade agreements in.

And we were starting to see those products more from Asia.

Like you had Taiwan and Japan,

was it was in full,

full swing at the time.

We had a really good trade agreement with Japan at the time.

Taiwan was the one member.

So those of you guys in the night that are boomers,

do you remember when everything was made in Taiwan?

I think I'm old enough to remember when everything was made in Taiwan.

This was before China.

So for those of you guys that are old enough,

it was made in Taiwan.

That was the thing.

Like all your tags said made in Taiwan.

It was in the late nineties,

early two thousands.

We first started getting that push with,

with China.

And,

and Amazon was actually one of the ones that really made it a bigger one.

But then the consumerism kind of started pulling over.

Okay.

And,

and you know,

so you started seeing this big inflow of cheaper goods.

And what happened in the nineties when we opened up trade to Asia?

Okay.

More.

What happened is,

is all these things that were made in the United States.

Okay.

This is,

it's funny because part of the reason that we exploded in our economy was by

giving away so much that people are complaining about now.

So here you go.

Okay.

I shouldn't be doing this,

but,

but this is,

this is just my take on it.

I'm not going to give any specific numbers,

but okay.

In the eighties.

All right.

You had a massive recession that was mostly because of the Iran and oil crisis.

Okay.

Which by the way would have ended earlier,

but Reagan and the Iran Contra thing basically,

which completely destroyed Jimmy Carter's presidential,

presidential,

uh,

he wasn't going to win anyways,

but they,

they,

they,

by holding off the hostages being released until after the election so that

Reagan could make it look like he scared them into doing it all the while,

uh,

we're swapping,

um,

uh,

weapons and money between Iran and the Contras in South America behind the

scenes.

Even though Congress said you can't give weapons to them,

they still did it by basically swapping money for weapons off the books with

the CIA.

I ran Contra.

We could do a whiteboard on that another time,

but the eighties,

this is when the crisis happened,

right?

You had,

you had Paul Volcker,

you had,

you had inflation,

you had oil prices,

the economy fucking collapsed,

right?

It was a big thing during Carter.

Everyone blamed Carter for it coming out of it.

You had Reagan.

Reagan kind of was the,

we're tough now.

Gorbachev,

we're taking it down.

We win the cold war.

Everybody's happy,

you know,

blah,

blah,

blah.

But then once that happened,

once,

once we beat communism,

okay.

All right.

We're going to spread democracy.

And where do we need to spread democracy first?

We didn't finish a job in 1945.

We're going to finish it now.

So we moved to Asia.

Okay.

And what do we do?

The United States.

Okay.

The good old U S of a,

okay.

Okay.

Good old U S of a,

sorry,

fucking upper peninsula.

Nobody gives a shit about you.

Okay.

Good old U S of a decides,

Hey,

we're going to,

we're going to,

we're going to,

we're going to head East.

Okay.

We're going to head East.

And so let me tell you something in the 1990s,

when you wanted to buy a TV,

okay.

Television costs you $3,000.

And that was,

that was,

that was 1990s,

$3,000.

Okay.

Okay.

You wanted to buy a camcorder that cost you $2,000.

You,

that was two 1990s,

$2,000.

Okay.

You want to buy a couch that puts you back $5,000.

And I'm talking 1990s.

Okay.

People didn't make as much money,

but they spent a lot,

much more money.

I'm taking it.

I'm like that fish who just loves to get hooked.

Oh God.

Hey,

Hey,

Billy,

don't,

that's a,

that worm isn't real.

It's on a hook.

Oh,

I know.

Oh,

take me daddy.

Like I'm,

that's who I am right now.

You know,

like I'm that fucking sadomasochist fucking,

you know,

submissive fucking fish.

You just love to get hooked and get out of the water.

Like,

Oh,

pull it out of my mouth.

Oh,

throw me in.

You dirty man.

I'm so slimy.

Now,

obviously I'm giving the high end of these things,

but it was very expensive.

So a lot of people think,

Oh,

things were cheaper back then.

As far as a disposable income,

it wasn't much cheaper.

Okay.

Because,

because the reason that people,

you know,

were able to buy larger ticket items is because they couldn't afford these.

And these were relatively new,

but they were made in the United States.

Cars were cheaper.

Homes were cheaper because everything was kind of built here and there was more supply.

And there was,

there was like a growing,

you know,

whatever.

But like all the other shit,

the consumer economy wasn't quite there.

So now the 1990s happened.

And in the nineties,

the cold war is over.

We beat communism,

whatever like that.

We have,

we have,

you know,

Iraq invades Kuwait.

And we say,

wait a second,

we ain't going through that,

that oil crisis again.

Fuck no,

you ain't doing this to us.

No,

hell no.

And we go over there and we do our shit.

And we basically play a deal with,

Hey,

listen,

we're going to bail you out,

but now we're getting a bunch of cheap fucking oil from you.

Okay.

And we're going to make sure that we help stabilize.

The rest of the mid east was like,

wait a second,

the U S is involved over here.

Fuck.

Right.

So you had that big league of nations where they were kind of like all on each other's

side.

They kind of worked together,

except they were against Israel.

But like,

because they were obviously the,

the,

the,

the,

all the shit that was going on over there.

But this league of nations was kind of like,

Oh shit,

we kind of like,

Oh shit.

And I'm not trying to be like,

Oh fuck you America.

But that's kind of like what happened.

Like,

Oh shit.

You know,

U S is over here.

We got to like,

you know,

whatever.

And we've talked about how this happened and obviously what was going on with Iran and

the whole nine yards there.

So,

um,

Iran,

Iraq war also happened.

So,

which is funny cause we armed Iraq and then we were against Iran with a shot.

It was just a weird fucking time.

Okay.

So now we move over to Asia and we're like,

all right,

we're going to bring it over to Asia.

So now Japan,

right?

Japan starts importing all of their cars and this collapses the,

the,

the,

the U S uh,

car market.

Ford could have jumped on board and said,

okay,

we'll start offering,

you know,

cheaper alternatives and,

and,

and easier to make it easier to replace and stuff like that.

But they're like,

no,

people aren't going to want to buy that cheap Japanese shit.

They want to buy our good American shit,

whatever.

They flood the market.

Now car prices start coming down.

Okay.

So now people can avoid more cars,

which means they have more disposal,

income.

Hey buddy,

you want to draw on my,

my board?

Okay,

go ahead.

Draw something.

That's a ghost.

Is he a scary ghost or a friendly ghost?

He's a scary ghost.

Ooh.

What else you got?

A pumpkin.

Okay.

And a captain America and a Hulk.

Okay.

And a Batman,

a Spider-Man.

Okay.

And a bad guy.

Oh no.

Oh,

Spider-Man is going to get the bad guy and he's going to cry.

Cry.

All right.

It's going to,

he's going to shoot him with his webs.

Yeah.

It's all over my face.

It's so sticky.

It's in my eye.

Oh,

you're gonna draw my hand.

I'm a bad guy.

Why am I a bad guy?

I heard high five.

Oh,

you're going to high kick.

I can't go.

I,

yeah,

go for it.

I,

yeah,

I,

yeah.

Oh,

close the door.

Close the door.

Good job.

All right.

I was just saying,

it sounds like our house every day.

The adult humor and patience got to love it.

It's difficult sometimes,

but you know,

I I'm,

I'm after what happened this week and I'm really,

really,

really trying to take a step back and say,

I need to be more aware or present and I need to fucking stop getting so frustrated and,

you know,

be more in the moment and more understanding of things because like I'm under a lot of

pressure all the time and it's always a lot going on.

I never have any time.

I'm just always like,

and so I just don't know when,

like I said earlier today,

as you get older,

you start learning that life stops giving you things and starts taking them away and we always end up saying,

we'll do something,

we'll do something to do something.

Then we find out it's too late and we're like,

we wish you would have,

we wish you would have,

we wish you would have.

I have to remember that and sometimes we need a wake up call and so normally I'd be like,

what's going on?

Why is he in here?

Like,

I,

you know,

I love him,

but I'm,

I'm working and stuff like that,

but it's like,

you know what?

If it bothers people that I have a moment with my son,

then it's Reggie Jackson's rock out 2600 times in his career.

The most.

In the history of baseball,

but you don't hear about the strikeouts.

People remember the home runs.

That Denzel Washington speech was fucking lit,

dude.

All right,

I'll give you guys an update on what we're going to do with bail once we find out from the cancer doctor tomorrow.

All right,

so Japan floods the US market with all these cars,

car prices get cheaper.

Well,

guess what?

When car prices get cheaper,

people have more disposable income.

So what happens?

They start spending and we start making these trade deals.

Right?

We start importing cars from Japan.

We start getting electronics and things from Korea,

South Korea.

And now our manufacturers here aren't doing it's cheaper to manufacture it over there.

It imports over here.

It's done cheaper and faster.

And so now the prices of things start going down.

TVs start going down.

Another thing.

More people have TVs,

which guess what?

More now they have,

it's cheaper.

They have more.

They have,

they have more money.

Also,

the TV is now advertising to them,

which means they use that.

Disposable income to buy more shit.

And so we start getting this massive run of people having more,

more disposable income.

Well,

what do they do with their disposable income?

They fucking spend it.

And when they start spending it,

they start ordering more.

So then the trade agreements grow and grow and grow and grow until eventually China decides,

let's give this capitalism thing a shot too.

And they,

they,

they,

they take all of their fucking major centers on the water and they say,

okay,

here's what we're going to do.

We're not going to control these markets.

We're going to let them free up.

And then we got this major oversupply of people.

So we're going to have them come in.

And that means we have cheap labor and we're gonna start doing this.

And then we start making those trade agreements,

which then exacerbates it.

But in the nineties we started doing it.

So we started having a surplus.

People think that Clinton just made us have a surplus.

Like he cut the budget down.

Like he cut spending down so low that,

that it gave us a surplus.

And I don't know why that is.

I think people misunderstand that that's not what happened.

Like there was a cut in spending,

but I think people misunderstand that,

that,

a balanced budget and I'm not taking anything away from Clinton,

you know,

and or his administration,

whatever.

But I think people need to also understand how this shit works because you're

either fed bullshit one way or the other,

but we had a balanced budget.

Now,

most of this was not done with Clinton,

right?

Clinton was just kind of there.

Uh,

Congress actually worked together,

ended up working together.

The R's and the D's actually came together and they,

uh,

they actually reached an agreement.

Okay.

This wasn't a hold one side hostage until somebody gives in.

They actually reached an agreement.

They cut,

they cut the spending,

right?

So here's the U S spending,

right?

He was spending is going up.

Okay.

But here's what happened,

right?

This was our revenue,

but all of a sudden our revenue did this.

So when you can do this,

you,

you re you achieve a balanced budget.

You achieve a balanced budget because all of this,

all of this GDP growth and consumer spending,

right?

And all this extra money gave way to whole new,

uh,

types of,

uh,

of,

of,

of businesses.

And then you had the tech boom,

right?

The nineties or the tech boom.

Then late in the nineties,

you had the.com era,

which is 1998 when this happened.

And so we had this massive increase in revenue.

And part of it was because GDP increased just because people were spending and

more people spending meant more jobs,

more jobs,

more,

more taxpayers,

more taxpayer,

more,

more income coming in,

right?

Balance.

Our trade balance was a little bit wild for a little bit there,

but,

but you know,

we used to be an exporter.

Then we were an importer,

but it ended up making,

and this isn't scale,

but this has happened.

Then,

what happened?

Then what happened?

Japan had zero interest loans.

If you,

uh,

if you ever needed it.

Oh yeah.

Japan's in zero interest rates were insane.

People were literally taking in the U S we're taking out loans in,

in Japan.

They crashed their economy.

Then nine 11,

not 11 happened.

Now,

regardless of your thoughts on nine 11 and,

and,

and,

and how it was done.

If,

if,

if it was a,

this or that,

if it was a blowback,

if it was,

uh,

this,

if it was who caused it inside,

whatever your fucking belief is.

This is what we're talking about.

Nine 11 happens.

Then war on terror.

Okay.

Nice catchphrase.

Everyone was shocked.

Um,

nobody would say no to anything.

Then the war on Americans.

Okay.

This is your Patriot act and the NDA and TSA and government agencies and

overload spending went insane in same.

And next thing,

you know,

we're spending a trillion dollars a year,

which is okay because we're bringing in a trillion dollars a year.

Well,

let me tell you what happens.

Spending never goes down.

And if revenue isn't increasing,

spending only goes up.

And then in 2003,

war in Iraq.

Oh,

here's another one.

And then we do operations in Syria and then so on and so on and so on.

And government and defense just keeps going up and up and up.

And then we have more and more.

So that's when the budget absolutely went like this.

And the spending went like that.

And once you get a taste of that spending and you realize,

imagine if you had a credit card.

Okay.

This is how the government operates,

right?

Imagine you had a credit card.

Okay.

Okay.

And why does that look like a fucking letter?

I don't even know what a credit card looks like anymore.

Okay.

Imagine you had a credit card.

Okay.

Or whatever.

And you spend money on it and you have a limit of $5,000 in your credit card.

And then you're at your $5,000 limit.

Okay.

And you're like, but shit, I really want to buy that.

I really want to go to that football game.

I wasn't expecting my team to make the playoffs.

I only do it every nine years.

It's only been eight years.

Fuck it.

I got to get airline tickets and tickets to the game and whatever.

Airbnb and stuff like that.

I'm going to fuck it.

You know what?

Let me see what happens if I swipe it.

Accepted.

$7,000.

You're like, wait a second.

What?

But my limit's $5,000.

How the fuck did I get the $7,000?

Okay.

And you're like, well, I really got to figure out a way of paying this, right?

I got a way of paying this.

I only have.

I only have $5,000 to cover it because that's what I thought I had expending it or whatever.

Man, I don't, I don't know.

That was, I made a bad decision.

This is going to come back to bite me.

And then the bank says, hey, hey, don't worry about that.

How about, how about we just issue a new credit card with the $7,000 on it, but we raise your

limit to $12,000.

Yeah, but I got to pay this stuff back.

We'll defer your payments.

Don't worry.

Don't worry.

We'll, we'll add interest on later on.

Okay.

Let's, let's up that up to $10,000.

So you still got $3,000 to go.

Yeah, but I haven't gotten a raise.

It works.

It doesn't work.

No big deal.

No big deal.

How about this?

Your home goes up in value every year, right?

Yeah.

Just issue us, you know, some, some equity from your home.

Really?

That's all I got to do.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You got 300 grand in your house.

Listen, we'll raise it up here.

You give us 300, you give us 3K in equity in your home.

Oh, cool.

Thank you.

So then you start spending 10K.

Fuck.

I can't, I don't have any more money.

And then you and your wife start arguing about it.

She wants to cut, she wants to cut the spending in the house, but she also wants to go fuck

the neighbor.

And you want to, you want to keep spending high, but you know, you, you know, or you

want to keep the spending going, but you also want to go to a Russian bath house.

And she's like, okay, how about this?

I'll only fuck him twice a week.

You go to a check.

Or a Slovakian bath house.

It's like, wait, what, wait, what?

So she wants to cut spending, but she wants to spend, she wants to cut spending at the,

at the household level, but wants to spend more on, on these dates.

And you want to, you know, whatever, whatever I'm, I'm, I'm losing my, I'm losing the fucking

plot here, but it just keeps going up and it doesn't stop.

So it never, it never went.

And then you can go and, and, and, and pay for, you know, renovations in the house and

you can go on this trip and that trip because there's no real consequence to it.

And everyone's telling you that eventually it's going to come back.

But you're like, I got this.

I got this house.

And as long as they keep taking equity in my house, they'll keep upping it.

But isn't that going to collapse?

Well, not really because the value of the debt you owe in the house goes lower and lower

every year.

But eventually, how do we go?

I was just talking about GDP ratio of, uh, in Italy.

What the fuck happened to me?

You're that unfuckable in the neighborhood.

I would hope so.

You started self-inserting with the bath house stuff.

Well, I was trying to think a way of how like one party will always say that we need to

increase spending.

But we need to do it in specific ways and we need to do it attached to this.

And the other part is like, we need to decrease spending, but then increases it somewhere

else.

It's like, wait, what?

And then they're like, oh, but we need it.

We want to increase spending, but we want to put it in these programs.

And then people are like, wait, but that's not where we should put it.

And these people like, we want to cut spending, but we want to increase it over here.

And it's like, what?

But then they don't, they don't keep up with that.

And then it doesn't make any sense.

And so they just continue to increase the spending.

They don't care about cutting it.

They just care about where they cut it.

And that's the wild thing.

And so I was trying to make a.

Uh, uh, uh, an example there, fuck.

I was cooking with the nineties and then I got, I got off topic cutting from one and

increasing another.

Isn't a net cut.

Exactly.

This all started because Italy is competent.

Italy hasn't been competent since nine.

Shit.

They haven't been competent since two 87 BC.

No, I take that back.

There was a small time.

They were confident in like one 50 ad.

I think the most competent thing that the Romans ever did was, uh,

Hadrian's wall.

I think that was the most competent, competent thing that the Italians ever did.

I think, I think that was the best, that was the only competent decision they made other

than other than getting their ass kicked in Northern Africa during World War II.

And then like ousting fucking Mussolini and then like flipping sides and going with the

U S but that was kind of like backs against the wall, the roads, well, the roads weren't

really the Romans.

They just kind of like did it.

I mean, I would say the roads were the.

The best thing that they did and it makes up for all the atrocities.

Not really.

But I think Hadrian wall scared of us Scots.

You weren't even the Scotch.

You were the fucking picks back then.

And they just realized that you guys didn't have anything worth fighting for.

Like they went up there and they fought you and they looked around at the Scottish land.

They go, nah, they can have it.

I didn't worry that literally nothing here for us.

Literally nothing here for us.

Bunch of people fucking wearing blue and banging sheep.

Like that's like.

And worshiping fucking tree stumps and shit.

Like we're good.

You guys can have that.

Who among us hasn't tree worship is Wales.

Well, the pics had all their fucking things.

Although the one cool thing about the pics is, is you ever seen those like, uh, those

shale rock, um, things that they made on the coastline of Northern Scotland.

Like that was really cool.

Don't get me started on, uh, on Boudicca Boudicca fucking smacked the shit out of them for a

while.

That's wild.

Imagine getting some, uh, some, some lady that just destroys you.

Although.

Although Italians, like you ever know how, like you always hear big titty golf girl.

Everybody loves a good big titty golf girl.

Wrong.

Italians do not.

Okay.

Italians hate them.

You'll never see an Italian man with a big titty golf girl.

If you don't get the reference, I'm sorry.

Was very local and ended ad for Boudicca and her people.

I'm a Scott married to an Italian.

Should I bring this up?

Wait, you're, are you, are you a guy?

Or a girl because there's Italian woman?

No.

Scott male.

Oh, just be happy.

Somebody married you.

Fuck.

Because here's the thing.

The Roman empire was already failing, right?

They had to split up into the Western Roman and Eastern Roman, which ended up becoming

the Byzantine, right?

Um, which ended up basically becoming the fucking, um, Turkey, right?

So whatever.

Long story short.

Oh, the Ottomans.

The Ottoman empire fucking lasted for a long ass time.

The Ottoman empire lasted longer than the fucking Eastern Roman empire, whatever.

But here's the thing.

The Western Roman empire was actually hanging on a little bit there, but then they did something.

They basically allowed the Visigoths, okay.

Who they'd been fighting forever to like cross the Danube and like come into Italy and settle

there.

They're like, you know what?

Here's the thing.

We're going to let you come in.

Like they were fighting the fucking Huns, right?

Like you've heard of Attila the Hun and shit.

Right?

Like, uh, uh, it was Attila the Hun, maybe it was the other Huns, I don't know, but they're

getting fucking beat up.

And so they let them come into their countries.

I'm not going to do a whole white whiteboard on this, but they let them come into Italy

and they let them immigrate into Italy.

Okay.

So the fucking Huns are fucking like crossing Europe and the Huns could have taken like,

like the rest of Europe.

They probably could have wiped out like the, like, like, like all the way they could have

probably taken all of Europe, but they just got like, kind of got fractured at the end.

So they let them come in.

So they, the Italians, the Romans let their arch, their old enemies, whatever they let

the Visigoths cross in and they let them do immigration, let them just cross the border,

but they let them keep their weapons.

Like they didn't make them disarmed before they came in and then they didn't like close

off the border.

They just kind of like let the immigrant, like, like immigrate in as whatever.

And then eventually the Visigoths did not, the Romans thought that they would like, uh,

like, like, like, like just to like move into their culture and kind of like become Romans

or at least, you know, emulate the culture.

Whatever.

And, and, and assimilate, but they didn't, they ended up just like staying their own,

like people and stayed it and just grew and grew and grew.

And then one day they're like, why don't we just like, like take this country?

And they did.

And they fucking like went on a rebellion and they were armed and stuff like that.

They got together, they trained, they got there and they fucking took Rome dude.

Fucking wiped them out.

And that was the final straw that take down the Roman empire.

This is a TLDR.

Obviously.

I'm going to get on the whiteboard one day.

What do you mean?

It sounds familiar.

You are not about to fucking take what I just said and, and no, hell no, you're not about

to put, nah, you're not about to do that shit to me.

No, I'm telling you history.

The Huns made it were dangerous.

The Visigoths were forced to move because of it.

They moved into Italy.

The Italians let them come in with their weapons and didn't like whatever they, they, they

thought they would assimilate a large number of them grew.

They became, you know, they became, they stayed their thing.

They got the, whatever they had a rebellion.

They took over and they took over the car.

This is not some fucking one to one.

You guys don't even start that shit should have built a wall.

You guys are so stupid.

I'm surprised you remember that you have doctor's appointments because I don't remember this

history shit like only, sorry, I'm getting geeked out on history stuff.

Damn.

Those Qualcomm puts actually would have paid when I hit two something.

You are a good guy.

Stocks guy.

How dare you?

You're giving the racist fuel for the fire.

I'm not giving anybody.

I'm telling you history.

How you interpret it is up to your own dumb ass self.

As a Scotsman, I don't understand anything you just said.

Oh, right.

Cut.

I had two stones.

They're fucking, they're fucking old.

I had a fucking ghost.

I had a great fucking night.

I don't know what the hell you're looking for.

Can't you?

Yeah.

Got a McDougall's and I got cans in my hands.

We're fucking picking the Romans.

I got the great.

I don't know if I can.

I didn't focus.

Yeah.

You're fucking great.

Can't I?

There's like two stones.

I fucked the haggis.

I got it warm first and I fucked the shit out.

You know, my wife looked like a farmer.

I had an accident.

She got sausage fingers.

She got sausage fingers.

She got sausage fingers.

She got sausage fingers.

She got sausage fingers.

I'm told you're great in the Highlands.

Yeah, that's great.

Well, fuck.

That's great.

Damn.

I don't know anything.

You know what I'm saying?

I'm great.

Hey, but you're not from the Highlands.

You're not from the Highlands, are you?

If you're from the Lowlands, it's not as bad.

These people, they don't speak a great English.

I don't want to tell you.

It's not my own problem.

It's their problem.

I want to tell you in a better language, but I can't do it because the fucking Welsh

don't speak English.

I don't want to tell you.

I don't want to tell you.

I don't want to tell you.

I don't want to tell you.

I don't want to tell you.

I want to tell you in a better language, but I can't do it because the fucking Welsh,

they're coming again.

We're still in the goddamn treaty with the fucking French.

You know that we still got one with the French?

I don't understand why.

It doesn't make any sense to me why we've got a fucking ... We've got a ... The fucking

French.

Remember, the fucking French took over the goddamn invaded England.

The bastard English are actually French.

We can't tell them that because they'll never forget, but we do, and if we remind them that

they're a bunch of ...

A bunch of fucking croissant eaters and that we have a treaty, I'm telling you now, you'll

never hear them talk about it, but they've got spotted dick.

We've got Nessie.

I'm sorry.

I don't know where I just went with that.

I'm blacking out again.

All I want is a fishnetted goth girl in my life, okay?

Do a Chinese accent?

I can't really do one of those, but every time I go into the nail place to get like

a pedicure done, like the last time I went in, the lady goes, she goes, this is a true

story too.

She goes, oh honey.

I go, what?

She goes, you walk on boat?

I go, no.

She goes, oh honey, look at your feet.

And I looked, she goes, you have so much, so much on the bottom.

And I go, whatever.

She goes, I get something.

She goes, she goes, honey, you stay right there.

And so she goes, and they get a fucking belt grinder or a fucking ... Not a belt grinder,

but a fucking ... Have you all ever seen where they have the drill bit and then they put

the circle sandpaper on it?

No, they're Vietnamese.

She goes, accent you think you can do, but actually can't.

She goes, honey, this take while.

You sit down.

And so I sit down and it's a ... She puts on the fucking big glasses.

And she goes, she goes, cancel.

She goes, ah, cancel the next one.

I'm like, what are you doing?

She goes, honey, sit there.

And I'm, dude, they actually fucking belt grinded my, my heels.

Honey, you got to come back more times.

No good.

I was like, okay.

And then the last time I went, it was a, it was a, it was a Hispanic girl and she was

the only like Hispanic girl at the whole place because everybody else was like Vietnamese

or whatever.

And it was her first day.

And I was like, sorry, they didn't know.

No, they do.

They actually use one of those.

I don't know if you guys have ever been, but if you have like really big calluses on your,

on your heels.

They bring out this like drill bit that at the end has a circle sandpaper thing and they,

and then they get the fucking actual cheese grater out and have to fucking Parmesan your,

your feet.

Men, I'm serious.

If you don't go and get, uh, your feet done from time to time, you're missing out.

Like, I'm not talking about like that weird shit where they like paint your nails and

like, but I mean like get a pedicure every now and then it sounds like, oh, that's not

a, I'm telling you right now.

Number one, it feels good.

Your feet look better.

So people don't look down at your nasty ass fucking feet and toes when you're wearing

flip flops or you take your shirt and shoot off in the house and wonder why nobody wants

to touch you.

And on top of that, it feels smoother.

And let me tell you something.

When you're like laying in bed or on the couch and you're kind of like, you know, for playing

and playing a kiss and stuff like that, and you rub your fucking graders across her leg,

it does not feel good.

Okay.

Although I probably have to throw away all my flip flops because I'm moving up to, uh,

to, to Delaware.

I was looking at the temperature today.

This is our week temperature this week at our house.

This is the temperature this week in the house in Delaware.

You see the difference.

Your kids will hate the move.

We'll see.

I mean, I grew up in the mountains of North Carolina, so I, I remember, you know, I, I,

I know seasons, but still it's like, I'm just worried about the move with bail.

We're gonna have to find out how he's doing.

So all fights with your kids will be fun.

If there's any snow and left, I'm too European to understand these numbers.

Okay.

What's the formula.

You know what?

I don't care enough to look it up.

Thanks for the blurb earlier.

What fucking blurb did I do?

I didn't do any blurbs.

Are you taking any days off to move for the move this week?

No.

Um, I am tomorrow.

I have to end the stream early because of the, um, um, you, you, uh, or sorry, um,

what was the question?

I just blacked out.

Oh yeah.

Tomorrow is a short stream because I have to take Bayo to the oncologist.

We have to find out if we're doing chemo or if it's too late.

Um, and then Wednesday is the FOMC Thursday.

Okay.

Okay.

Friday should be regular days unless the worst case happens.

Friday's Halloween Saturdays.

My wife's birthday.

Poor thing.

What a fucking birthday Sunday.

I drive up.

I'm thinking I'm driving up in.

So here's my problem.

I'm driving up a Sunday morning and I want to drive halfway with Bayo and I, but I can't

tell where I want to stop, um, because I don't want to drive too much the first day, but

I also don't want to drive too much the second day.

It's about 17 hours and I'm taking 95 hours.

So I'm thinking about stopping somewhere between either Sumter, Florence or Fayetteville.

I think that's probably my best.

I think somewhere in this area is the best place to stop for the day for the night and

just get an Airbnb there, crash and then, uh, and then, and then head back up the next

day.

Um, because it's 16, 17 hours and to Florence, it's about nine hours.

It's about 10 to Fayetteville.

And so I got to stop somewhere here.

I just don't know.

I don't know where yet.

Why leave Florida?

Just don't get a hotel while I have bail with me.

Do you know anybody that can, you can stay with there?

No, I don't know anybody there.

Um, I don't, I don't even think anybody that watches my show is in this area, uh, but it's

better that I just get a place cause I don't know how late we're going to be.

So I figure I'll probably stay in Florence or Fayetteville depending on how we, how early

I leave.

And then Monday morning I'll get up and we'll drive to, um, to Delaware and we're, the place

we're staying is just north of Wilmington.

Like, um, in this area up here.

Right.

So, um, you know, this is, this is the area we're staying in where we're renting, um,

you know, close to the, you know, this area, Penny Hill area or whatever.

Um, and then we're going to be there for six months while we test out the winter to see

how, um, how, how we feel, how the kids do, how my body does with the weather, obviously,

you know, with.

And what happens there, uh, and then look for a house.

And if we do do well, then, um, I want to buy a house in this area.

I think I personally like the, the Hocusin area.

Um, I like this area because obviously it's, it's quiet.

It's up in the Hills there, but, uh, 41 takes you straight to Wilmington and you could,

if you want it to get over to, uh, um, you know, any of the other, uh, you know, Philly's

not far away and, and everything like that.

Uh, my wife likes Newcastle, but I think she's more partial towards.

Um, the Newark area to buy better start winter coat shopping.

Oh, I already have some.

And, uh, there's a goodwill not far from where we're staying.

I have to donate.

I have to donate all our shit.

I, I, I I'm running out of time because all the shit that happened this weekend, I just

took a bag and I'm sorry, but all of our old stream shirts that we love, like the, I love

Hentai and the all in ACB and all those shirts I'm donating, I can't take them with me.

Um, but like I'm donating the whole house, like everything in the house is just going

and I'm thinking now, instead of taking trips to salvation army.

I think it, and I couldn't find any place to, um, to, to donate all the stuff.

I think I'm going to just, um, put everything in trash bags and have, um, salvation army

come pick it up because I've got everything from a printer.

I've got, um, I've got, uh, Keurigs, I've got plates, cups.

We've got everything in a household, uh, I got to dump our King bed in the, in the thing

here.

20 minutes away, bro.

We can hit the gym and I can oil you up after bro.

Um, but I just, I just have to get rid of everything.

I mean, I'm gonna put some stuff in the attic, like all my family stuff I haven't gone through

yet after my grandfather passed.

But other than that, I'm just donating the whole house and there's no place to give it

to.

Like you would think that, um, you know, there'd be a place where you could give a bunch of

kids toys and, and, and clothes and, and everything in a household pots, pans, you know, cups,

you know, uh, things, uh, appliances, electronics, uh, my old X-Box, I mean like everything.

We have so much, a whole house full of stuff.

We can't take it with us.

And if we want to rent this place out, we can't just leave our shit here.

So like we have to donate it.

You know what I mean?

Like, and, and, and, and I wanted to just give it to somebody in need, but there's no

way of finding people in need and there's no places to donate stuff like, like for free.

Like you just can't take it.

Like the, you know, and if you do, you have to take several trips really far away.

I'll take that X-Box.

It's an X-Box one, bro.

I wanted to go directly to somebody in need, like somebody out there who, who has a house

who really needs to like get stuff and they just haven't had time or money or whatever

to do.

And it's like, well, here's an entire household, like every kid toy and every like, you know,

odd and, and, and like.

Furniture or, or, or, or like, you know, uh, accessory you need in the house.

Like it's yours.

Like, like I have a fucking, I have, I'm not even kidding you.

Somebody gifted me one year, a box with four, uh, uh, uh, steakhouse knives.

What, what is it?

It's a brand name too.

Like Outback or Texas Roadhouse knives.

Hey, what's up?

You got any news from anybody or anything?

Try to relax your anus.

They're stolen knives.

They're not.

I never thought that for Christmas they would give me like Longhorn, Longhorn Steakhouse

collector knives.

I'm dead serious.

I have every, we had a nut milker we gave away.

I put my Keurig in the, in the go back.

Um, I mean, I've got shit you wouldn't believe, like, I don't know what to do with all this

stuff.

How the fuck you milk nuts?

Ask your mom.

It's like a thing that, that Ede sent it to me because there was a joke on his channel

years ago about nut milk and it's where you just take them and you put them in the, in

the, um, in the thing.

Yeah.

It has like a, a, a, like a, like a screen and you put the nuts in there and you take

this big, like a wooden thing and you just like push it down in there and you grind it

up.

And what it does is, is as the nuts like, um, uh, break up the, the, the, the, the, the

screen catches the pieces and then all of the insides like mix in with the water and

it makes like a nut milk.

Can I DM you through discord?

I mean, if you know somebody in, in, in Broward County that needs stuff, please let me know.

Um.

I would like to give this to somebody who actually needs it and wants it and doesn't,

doesn't have the money for it.

Then otherwise, cause I've just got a lot of shit.

I got a lot of shit and we want to give it away because we just can't take it with us.

We're staying in a furnished property.

Do you have any weed?

No.

Will you still be a Jags fan or will you be switching teams when you're moving?

I'm always going to be a Jags fan.

Although I don't really have a college team anymore cause it's been so long.

And so I'm thinking like, how cool would it be to, cause I'm used to having shitty teams

as my favorite team.

How cool would it be to fucking start like becoming a fan of the University of Delaware?

What are they called?

The blue hens or some shit.

Are you excited about your trip?

Not as much because I want to make sure that that Baio's okay cause he's under a lot right

now and I want to make sure that it's not too stressful for him cause it's not going

to be good if it is.

Are you still moving up there to unseat the Congressman?

No, that's not, that's not what I'm up there to do.

I'm not going up there to fucking become a politician.

Are you out of your mind?

Okay.

We've lost the plot here.

Um, I got pizza.

I gotta eat real quick.

Let me, let me, let me give you guys marbles.

Let me get this pizza real quick and let's go.

Why is the college American football scene so big in America?

Because people want to pretend that they were, they almost were good enough to play.

Also when you go to a college and you're in that atmosphere, like everyone is watching

it.

So like you become a fan and then you like become loyal to your college because it's

like a status symbol or like a networking thing.

It is what it is, man.

Just that's like saying it's the same way as like, why the fuck do you fucking European

people fucking care about a bunch of like a third of your population?

Kicks a fucking ball around, right?

Like, Oh my God, we gotta go kick a fucking ball around until it hits a net.

Like why are you so obsessed with that shit?

Like we have two leagues.

We have the NFL and the NCAA.

You have more leagues than you have fucking teeth.

Okay.

That's actually not a lot.

All right.

But like you got, you have like 16 fucking leagues in one town and the town has like

30 people like, like literally you guys have to play on multiple teams just to, just to

fucking do it.

It's weird.

Okay.

So don't fucking come at me with that bullshit.

Don't say get smoked.

I wasn't being crazy.

I wasn't being mean.

Funny thing is, is you have 16,000 fucking leagues and you still can't make a team loser.

Why do you hate your European viewers so much?

I don't.

They're just easier to fucking shit on.

Like there's more to shit on for my us viewers, but like we're used to it.

So it's like people in the EU and other places think they have like some kind of moral high

ground on us.

So when you like tell them, even if you're wrong or you're, you're baiting and you tell

them that they're worse.

They like go.

They go into a fucking frenzy of trying to explain why they're better.

Plus I'm trying to keep my, um, keep my mind off everything else.

All right.

You guys ready?

All right.

Let's run it.

Yo GP us.

I didn't even see that.

Let's go.

That's right.

Bay.

Oh, you bark.

I've never, I've always told you.

You can't bark at people.

Go for it.

Go for it.

Good to see you back on your feet, buddy.

Yo.

Good pick up on N and E earlier.

Maybe what's this goofy song.

Welcome brother.

You want another piece of pizza?

There's my bail.

I'm glad the medicine's working.

28.

Okay.

Oh my God.

Not another song.

Oh my God.

Woo.

Yeah.

He's getting all the, the human food.

They give them that medicine predisone to kind of give them a little short term relief

with the tumors.

And we gave it to our last dog cause it was crazy.

So my wife and I, I had a dog before I met my wife and my wife fell in love with him,

but he was my dog and we signed the lease to this place.

Two days later he got diagnosed with lymphoma and then he was gone like five days, four

days later.

We signed the lease for our, we, we, we, we, we live here.

We get bail.

We buy the place.

We signed the lease for Delaware.

Six days later he gets diagnosed with lymphoma.

It, it, it, it's just insane.

But with our other dog, he was a lot older.

He was like 12 and um, the predisone worked for one day and then he was gone with Bayo.

We gave it to him and he's, he's back on his feet today.

So he's looking, he's looking okay.

I just don't know.

I just don't know.

Um, every time we've moved, we've, we've tried moving to Delaware four times.

The first time my grandfather died.

Yeah.

The second time I got diagnosed with a life altering condition.

The third time her dad was hospitalized and had to have emergency surgery.

This time bail.

It's like, what?

Like it will be cursed.

So like I said, we're going to go to the oncologist tomorrow to see if we do chemo or if it's

not worth it now.

But if, if we do, I'm going to drive up with him on Sunday for two days, just him and I.

So I'm really hoping that, that, that he's okay for that.

I need a Yolo though.

I need a Yolo to pay for my dog's fucking treatment.

Um, one of the things I wanted to talk about.

Um, one of the things I wanted to talk about.

Um, one of the things I wanted to talk about.

Uh, I can't, I can't wait until I go to Delaware.

I'm going to be, I think I'm the fun.

We're the first family to ever intentionally moved to Delaware since like 1750 and we're

probably the first people to ever move from Florida to Delaware.

So, um, so yeah, so I think I'm going to be a, I think I'm going to be noticeable in Delaware.

All right, we got a lot of fresh powder here.

I don't know if I wanted, if I want to deploy it yet or not.

Poet did an offering.

That might be an interesting one to run again.

I think, uh, but the mean run is kind of done right now.

made good money on poet you know i'm gonna buy some guts that's what i'm gonna do that's the

only thing i think i'm gonna buy right now you look like all the people up there though you'll

blend right in i don't think it's a look i think it's just the way the way i am uh bales are going

retriever my cousin's reviewer got cancer when he was like six or seven and died quite quickly

thank you um yo there it is good play just took a little while to get going i don't know what the

announcement is but i'm glad we were in it i don't think that person was making a six seven joke

i just felt like the way they said it was kind of like okay why did i buy paypal again okay the

reason that i was playing paypal on the daily was because of um the mastercard integration that they

had i don't know what the reason is now but it's cool google introducing an uh agent or agentic

commerce solution for merchants from paypal and google cloud sometimes you get lucky sometimes

you get lucky my biggest play today too i mean the the other half of it is sitting at one and a

half percent down so i can't lose it

money it is what it is sometimes you get lucky you're in the you're in the play for i guess good

reasons do you ever use covered calls sometimes i do um i used to do it on um on my intel shares

for a while there all right um biggest mover today for us is uh clarna finally up um is there

anything else moving today oh rivian leaps are doing pretty good you're doing good piton doing

good kodak still going i took you you calls earlier did not sell them um but gonna hold

uh the ones i have because they are um they are for um january it's only two months out but i want

to see if there's any flip-flopping on this uh on this china deal are we in guts not in a while

why is gpus going well we've been buying gpus every time it goes down to 36 and then it runs

back up to like 40 so uh it's been uh it's been it's been it's been a solid almost a guarantee

for a while there um any predictions on upcoming earnings calls this week man i don't know i mean

85 of companies have beat so far i mean only 15 have have uh have uh have reported but man they've

they've they've been killing it i think the craziest play was we got into jzxn uh last week

again and then this morning it ran 60 off the bitcoin news and i sold on the way up and i was

like cool i'm gonna go back into it and then my broker's like you can't buy this anymore i'm like

okay maybe that's a good thing next is doing well this morning stss is good mltx is still up

ccap is up mlgo we grabbed last week that's doing pretty good um

nothing really else moving right now capital one was booming this morning and gave it all back

although i think my biggest play today is r surprisingly enough like i was getting crushed

on that and i just kept buying the dip on thursday or whatever day it was and the iv crush was insane

but it came back it came back pretty heavy i'm at uh 99 overall now on this i only have three calls

bm and r plus six percent well bm and r said that they now have 3.3

million ethereum tokens thanks for 20 on paypal you were not supposed to take options on this bro

this was just a this was just a a speculative trade that we took after open because of the um

because of the mastercard news this morning um i didn't know that the google announcement was

going to happen obviously and i got half stopped out for only about a half a percent but the other

half because i did a tiered stop loss of half percent and then one and a half percent the half

percent one got stopped out but the one and a half one's still going so we're still running

any feelings on hood i mean i think based on

everything we're seeing hood with hood it's still got a long way to go you know i mean

if the market continues the way it is because even though it's on the speculative side

it's it's it's taking everything i mean it's literally getting all of the retail trades it's

getting assets under management it's getting the calci prop bets and the prediction markets it's

getting all the crypto uh transactions it's getting um it's just it's just conglomerates

becoming like i'm almost a uh the sofi of the finance where with younger people because it's

a whole new generation robin hood is that with the

with the with the with the you know investing trading and and basically prop betting or or

prediction markets for younger people like they've just got a lot and i mean if you're looking at

valuation of hood based on where we looked at valuations five years ago or 10 years ago

it seems overvalued but if you consider the way the market's been trading and how people are are

putting stuff in i mean it just unless we have an actual you know cyclical rotation or a a market

drawdown or a an iwm russell kind of momentum stock pullback it doesn't really have many of

these things in its way right now i mean they're eating every fucking sec um uh charge every single

investigation every single uh uh they're the cost of doing business let me tell you how these

businesses do things they will intentionally do something illegal or not totally legal and just

take the fine for it because if they i told you about the dollar tree thing dollar tree intentionally

steals money from people but every time they lose a court case on it they get they get sued for it

they lose 250 million dollars but they make a billion dollars

doing it so in it's the cost of doing business robin hood does the same thing they just they

don't wait for you know clearance or or regulations or oversight or uh you know um an approval they

just do something and if they get hit with a with if they get if they get fined for it they cost

them 20 million dollars but if they make 400 million off of it they don't care it's the cost

of doing business like johnson and johnson right with all the shit that they did they just put

products out there and if they made a billion dollars yeah sure they might you know they

fucking kill some fucking kid you know

in their in their mind it's like oh well you know but it cost them 300 million but they made a

billion you know what i mean like it's fucked up but that's just how the world works and robin hood's

in that momentum they're like we're first to market if we either one of two things happens

either a we're cleared and we make 500 million or we get fined and we lose 100 million but we're

still profitable 400 million that's the mindset they call it the cost of doing business dollar

general not dollar tree thank you remember i said this before when it comes to speeding a fine

is a tax on poor people

that's what it is okay for people with money it's the cost of doing business

okay if you are if you are if you are a multi-millionaire you can drive as fast as you

want you can do fucking 100 120 on the interstate why because if you get pulled over and you get a

big speeding ticket and a reckless driving ticket it's nothing to you right you don't care and if

you get points you can just pay for a fucking you know a good lawyer to fucking get it you know

whatever in miami they made it to where they were so tired of

um they were they were so tired of of of of you know putting people in jail for weed on the

weekends and shit like that that they said all right if you have uh over a certain amount of

weed it's a hundred dollar fine people with money just smoke weed down the fucking um down the block

and they just keep hundred dollar bills in their pocket you know nobody cares it's it's what it is

if it's non-criminal you know it's it's it's considered a fine all right a fine is a tax on

poor people i'm not trying to be a fucking you know uh oh stocky's a tanky ally this is just a

this is just true like you can't lie you can't you can't pretend it's not true it's not true it's not

not if you have money i'll give you an example my dog okay we had to take him in because he was

sick they did a blood test it cost us a thousand dollars for everything they said there's something

wrong we had to take him to a specialist cost me four thousand dollars five thousand dollars

wiped out my my available capital i have my cash but i had it there are people out there who would

not be able to even get the diagnosis or if they did they would put them in debt i'm very you know

in a good position i'm not

lucky i worked hard but i'm in a position where that hurts and now it's it's it's it's messed up

my a lot of my financial things there but i was able to do it during game stop i made a lot of

money and my in-law my wife's parents were in india during covid and everyone was dying they

don't tell you on the news about how many people in india died millions of people died especially

in the in the big cities okay there was no oxygen for people that had it there were people that

couldn't get in the hospitals the air quality was so bad because of all the burning

stuff in there then they started burning bodies that made the air quality even worse and people

were just fucking dying it i took an ungodly amount of our money and i got them out of there

okay we got them out of there we saved them and i'm i'm not upset that i spent all this money i'm

glad that i had it you see what i mean so you know it the the the the inverse of that is is if

somebody wants to go around and fuck around and they've got money they don't care because it's

not a deterrent to them you see what i mean you said you had pet insurance and you said you had

insurance are you happy with it i don't have pet insurance anymore we we let our pet insurance

lapse two weeks ago because we were planning on just restarting it at the new in in uh in in

delaware but this just happened it is what it is i i you know what i mean it is that's why i have

to have this conversation with my wife because if we go in the chemo treatments or whatever

treatments are tens of thousands of dollars for a short period of time you know but you can't have

that with her because that's that's her baby right now so it is what it is but yeah and so i'm never

sad that i had to spend all the money i made on these things i'm glad that i'm not going to have

to be able to do it right like i i i'm thankful for that you know i'm and you know and it is what

it is and so but but but with people you know don't understand i and it's not that i don't

understand that's why a lot of streamers especially younger streamers they don't they don't think

about these things because they just didn't have to go through that right like they started

streaming when they were in their teens or in college or right after and they never really

had to financially deal with absolute fucking struggles on their own in a serious manner

you know and so they got all this money and so in their brain this is just a normalized thing

and i'm somebody who's been

homeless and i've been abject poverty poor and i've gone through the shit and the ringer my

whole life so i'm always thinking elsewhere you know sure i wish these things didn't happen and

i wish it was there but people are like oh you must be fucking loaded from all the money you've

made and stuff like that i'm like i've spent it but not on like stupid shit like i didn't spend

it on you know fucking vacations and you know nice clothes and nice cars and watches and shit

like i spent it on our family and things that we took care of and like these were things that

happened but it didn't put me in debt and so it's like you know i think about

that in a lot of ways and you know but like i said on the flip side having money also allows

you to get away with things you know the more money you have the more shit you can get away with

right when you're a multi-conglomerate corporation and you get a 50 million dollar fine it's like

well how much do we make off of it it's cost of doing business right i got a free i got a free

one thousand dollar i got a free loan of a thousand dollars to trade with from my folks is that a

minority comment huh

did i miss something like are you in the minority because you've been given money to trade with

or am i attacking minorities like what did i miss are you in a minority for i don't know how else to

word that um no money to trade with dude what the fuck don't say what the fuck to me you're the one

who literally wrote i got a loan a free loan of a hundred thousand dollars to trade with from my

folks is that a minority comment what what is a minority comment what do you mean what the fuck

you literally said you literally said you literally said you literally said you literally said you

literally said i got a free loan of a thousand dollars to trade with from my folks is that a

minority comment how else am i supposed to take that did you use chat who did you use for your

your english translation for that because i'd like to short that company i think what you're

saying is does that mean you're in the minority yes if your folks give you a thousand dollars to

gamble with you're probably in the minority but don't don't don't don't feel bad about that like

you can't compare yourself to other people comparison is the theft of joy it's an old

saying it's very true comparing yourself to people who have more than you or better than you will

always make you feel like you don't have it you're not good enough or you don't have enough or you

don't you're not you're not whatever and it'll ruin you you'll always be in a rat race but also

comparing yourself to somebody who has it worse will always make it seem like your problems aren't

uh important and that they don't have you're not justified in feeling the way you do because

someone else has it worse which will destroy you just as well right you need to understand that

you're what you're going through and what you're dealing with and your situation is unique to you

and you're very justified in feeling you know helpless or anxious or whatever in any way i feel

like people misunderstand that and i hear it all the time like earlier when uh when when sarah told

me something that happened with her family like i understand that what she went through is is is

extremely rough and it and if you were comparing it it would be like well that is some people would

say well that is worse than what you're going through stocky or whatever she didn't mean it

that way and i didn't take it that way i understand that and i understand that and i understand that

she is dealing with something in her life that is very difficult as i'm dealing with something

that's difficult in my life you don't compare right it's never like oh i shouldn't be sad about

something happening to me because someone else had something happening to them that's worse and

she understands that i understand that too but some people in here were like oh stocky whatever

and i'm the same way there are people who are who are going through stuff that's way less

you know difficult than something let's say i'm going through at a time but i don't offset that

like oh you're doing that well guess what i'm going through or you know what you think it's

like for example if a kid is 18 years old and his first girlfriend breaks up with him

and he just you know he or she is absolutely devastated you can't look at and be like

get used to it kid or you think this is bad wait until you you know lose your first job or whatever

wait wait until you start losing family it's like bro you you don't understand that's the worst

thing that's happened to that person in their life to that point right there will be times when there

are worse things that happen in their life up to that point as well but you have to understand the

the the the reference to that point is that it's not a good thing it's not a good thing it's not a

the frame of reference there right like like you may be dealing with you know you're you know you

might be losing something or you lost your house or whatever like that and you're like you know and

somebody might be like yeah but i lost my whole family in a fucking fiery crash off of a bridge

and i want you know i mean like bro you're not helping the situation like there's no comparison

here like either empathize with the person or fucking move on like you're not helping people

there and i see that a lot um and and so i like to i like to talk about that so does that mean

that you're in the privilege sure if you compare yourself to somebody who's not in the privilege

who doesn't have that but that doesn't that shouldn't make you feel bad like you shouldn't

feel bad like you know that that that you you know oh i have a thousand dollars for my parents

to gamble or trade with uh should i feel bad about that why that's the situation you have and and and

and you're dealing with it like you shouldn't be comparing like somebody who has 10 million from

their parents versus somebody who just inherited debt from their parents don't ever let that happen

comparison is the theft of joy and the theft of your mental health okay just like most streamers

don't talk about their personal money and finance unless

they're pretending that you know they they they this or whatever i don't mind sharing it with

people and it's not like oh stocky you know hey i i did really well for a long time there and i had

to spend all my money on on on family and tragedies and things that happen or you know the health care

or whatever like in my family i don't look at it that way i'm like i'm not sad it's gone and i'm

not feeling bad for myself i'm happy that i was able to do that you know what i mean like you know

i'm happy that i was able to do that i'm i feel good that i was in a position to be able to do

that the opportunity

that i had after i worked hard and took chances and did what i did and and and the money the

success or whatever i had for a short period of time i was able to to take that and put it

somewhere else sure you might think to yourself yeah but you know you spend it and you don't get

any tax breaks you have to pay the taxes on the money or if you just invested all of it in this

time is that i still did okay with what i had but i was able to take care of family you know i'm able

to take care of my health somewhat hopefully we can do something with with bail we're moving you

know it it was a lot you know it's a lot and i'm glad that i was in that situation but i don't

myself never gonna do that and i think it's because i've had the lowest of the low and the

highest of the high in my life that i'm just kind of able to balance my my brain on that

um there are too many people in this world uh to be in competition with everything else the

only person i have to get better is that yeah you know it is it is true but it's also you can't also

take it's a it's a fine balance because there's not one of these like oh you should always be

striving for more or oh you should never want for more you've got to have a balance everybody's

individual i just don't want anybody feeling like they have to be striving for more and i'm not

to compare themselves to anybody because we always tell don't compare yourself to people with more

right they'll be like don't compare yourself to people with more than you you'll never be happy

you'll always be chasing but then those same people will turn around and say you should be

thankful for what you have bitch you just told me not to compare well it's different don't compare

yourself to have more but you should feel bad or be thankful that you have more than someone else

no what are you talking about that's not how this works that's not how this works i need to focus on

what i need to do i need to focus on my battles i need to focus on what i have and what i want and

noise you've got to drown out the noise you should be thankful that you have what you need

to survive and thrive if you were given it yes but if you worked hard for it i'll give you an example

people say that gamestop made me stocky gamestop made you stocky that made no it didn't i'm almost

at the same viewership i was before gamestop i quit my fucking job right like i i took a huge

chance i was making no money for a while there i grinded i worked hard

i never sold out i never you know uh took the easy road out i did what i did i evolved with

myself and i built a community and i built a foundation and then covid happened and then

gamestop happened and then now we're at where we're at no i didn't get i didn't get lucky

right i didn't get lucky i worked hard to get where i was there were some great catalysts

that happened but if i hadn't worked hard to get there look at all the streamers that came in

because of covid and gamestop and they had viewership and they were doing pretty good

and they're all gone now because they didn't build something right that's not how luck works

and so i don't like to look at the same thing like yes i should be thankful i should be thankful

that i worked hard and and i and i found success no i'm thankful to the people who watch my show

who decide hey i want to watch this guy and and and and and you know whatever but i also can't

take away from this and say oh you know i didn't have anything to do with it you have to give

yourself some credit or else you'll never feel like you've accomplished anything you don't have

to be narcissistic about it but give yourself some credit don't let people like minimize your

hard work because something happened that if you didn't set yourself up to take advantage of that

you never would have had it it never would have worked for you in the first place so you gotta

you gotta think about it you gotta find good balance how much did you make during gamestop

from gamestop you're such a contrarian literal several streams ago you said you were lucky

do you understand what luck is lucky you're thinking that buying a scratch off is the type

of lucky i'm talking about i'm talking about the type of luck where luck is a mixture of opportunity

and daddy what was it what's the other thing hold on i'm i'm thinking uh my brain's out of it right

now preparation meets up meets opportunity or whatever it is okay so for example if you build

something up right and you work hard for it and then something comes along you benefit from it

that's a type of luck right the luck is is is that you you you know you you were that the

opportunity happened but the opportunity happens to everyone why isn't everyone

has is able to to take advantage of it because they have they built up right and so that's what

i was getting at it's not about me here i'm just talking about in general like give yourself we

don't give ourselves enough fucking credit for things in life i am only talking about this

because of what happened to me you talk a lot about life today because life is fucking hitting

me in the goddamn nuts again man my fucking life has kicked me in the nuts all my fucking life dude

and it is fucking kicking me in the nuts right now and and and and i'm putting a lot of shit

moving the house dealing with what's going on it's putting a lot of shit in perspective and a

lot of things that i've taken for granted or that i've i think about but i don't put into action i

need to start putting into action i will shut the fuck up i am sorry you're right i am absolutely

fucking being preachy today but sometimes when you're going through some shit and you're having

self-realizations or reminders you just talk i'll shut the fuck up i'm i'm spending too much

time on this bullshit you're right good trade on paypal today when life kicks you in the nuts

make nut milk okay are you martin scorsese's grandson i don't know i don't know i don't know

i don't know if there's a joke there or not give me a stock that can put 100 into and scout five

bucks and we'll use it to sub i don't want your fucking money be one of those shaolin monks that

can absorb a nut shot the only reason i'm still here alive today is because i was able to just

absorb it enough um let's see no i'm not doing a fucking go fund me for my dog bro what is wrong

with you let's see um let's see here we got uh

robot right here at four bucks fuck it i'll buy a few shares with you a stupid fucking play right

all right i bought 25 shares a whole 25 shares i bought 90 worth at 402 all right brother just you

and me we'll do this just you and me all right i'm gonna put a 10 loss i'm willing to risk a

whole nine dollars on this you should do an only fans page for your dog what a weird fucking thing

to say i mean you could you're free to say but that was a weird fucking thing to say although

it's probably not as weird as what i said discord the other day when i was really feeling down

about it i said however many more days i got with them i'm just gonna download a bunch of like

grooming videos of female dogs and put it up on the big screen for him but only collies

oh wait we doing stupid how about buying the carvana scam sock um i've actually never bought

carvana i bought from carvana but never bought the stock no when somebody comes in the community

they say give me a stupid play for 100

bucks in other words they're asking me to give them a fucking basically put 100 down a blackjack

table for one hand although the difference is here is you can stop loss it and so i do that

the problem is is that i end up usually finding one that bounces back and then people think it's

a legit thing and then they'll go in one and it'll be the one that doesn't give your dog ashwagandha

well he has late stage lymphoma it's in all of his lymph nodes and he has a large mass in his chest

so they gave him i took zero

my shares but i did take some uuu january calls i'm gonna miss the signal service when you move

to delaware what do you mean

first off this isn't a signal service and second of all you think i'm just gonna stop streaming when

i go to delaware you guys are just gonna be uncomfortable when the background is different

i'm gonna hear you guys bitch about that for weeks i'm almost considering getting a green

screen and just putting this background in there are you gonna be gone for more than three years

well we're renting for six months the problem is i gotta get this house in order uh when we move out

and i don't think because of all the shit that's happened this week we're gonna be able to get this

house in order before we leave so that means that uh i'm gonna have to fly down a couple times i

hear people to come in here and fix like shit in the house paint the walls um move some of the shit

out of here if i can't get everything out in time so i just made 18 on i robot how did you do that

you didn't make 18 on i robot are you there to take out the first trans congressperson's job in

delaware no no i'm not gonna be a politician if i was i'd run for senator not fucking congressman

although i think being the only congressman from the state would be easy path to to to set it how

am i i don't i don't know man i i i'm gonna fly down here twice but i don't want to fly down too

much because obviously the stress for bayo but um more importantly it's a lot of work um but we're

basically i already have three giant black trash bags full of stuff i'm donating including all my

old clothes um a bunch of appliances in the house i gotta set my printer out um there's just so much

stuff that we're just gonna toss we're not gonna throw the trash we're gonna give it to to salvation

army because like i said we don't have anybody to to

to give it to we have a whole house full of stuff we pull out couch we have children so so many toys

and kids games and stuff we have like a whole house of of things that we need to get rid of

because we can't keep it here because we can't sell this as a or rent this as a furnished apartment

or a house so um we have to get rid of all that we were gonna do it this week but with everything

going on i don't think we can so basically i'm just taking the clothes that i'm gonna wear

and they're gonna take their things and clothes they're gonna get on the plane on tuesday i'm

driving up sunday to tuesday and then i'll just have to fly back and just

try to hire companies and people to come in and and you know paint and and and fix the drywall the

little holes in the drywall from the kids stuff and um you know some of the small things like the

toilets and stuff like that just get it get it fixed and taken care of and then maybe we could

do it but the six months that we're up there uh the six months that we're up there um it'll give

us an idea of whether or not uh we like it and if my body can take the winter how cool of a story

is it that you punched the future democratic candidate of the president united twitch con i

punched the governor of california i didn't even get no him and i were passing and i got into a

very quick altercation if you want to call it that with accidental altercation with his security guy

and that was it they didn't tell us he was coming we didn't know and then he just showed up and as

soon as he did i was like well he's running for president that's why he's at twitch con he's

trying to get the younger younger vote and then um and then of course this morning during the

morning call we talked about it he's uh he's he's saying that uh he's uh open to running for

president uh looking he's gonna see what happens with the midterms first

trump dismisses the speculation of being vice president of uh election 2028 election we talked

about golden flows we talked about the nikki uh being above 50 000 for the first time zell

saying it plans to allow users to start making international payments using stable coins trump

saying he's increasing the tariffs on canada for 10 percent uh mckinsey talk tencent now using a

says ai now generates half of its new code they're basically vibe coding um apple one of several tech

companies that are going to contribute to the construction of the trump's 90 000 square foot

white house ballroom

and deli meats have hit an all-time high ladies and gentlemen also weebs are are you thought it

was bad that furries were becoming uh out of the shadows weebs are second time that a weeb movie

is there the number one movie at the box office this weekend was chainsaw man the movie res arc

would you consider doing a stream of just the open road next week no because you because because i

gotta i don't want i don't want to be distracted while i'm driving first you slap around the card

trick streamer then newsome our favorite streamer i did not slap that guy for

i will i don't understand why people don't you know i mean i feel i still feel bad about what

happened but like it was understandable like what happened like and i feel bad because the guy like

20 minutes earlier was talking about how he's such a big fan of me and my stream and then i i you know

just it's just a thing like it happened at twitch con when i was on jake's stream one of his buddies

jumped up and came running up to him but came right by me and almost decked the guy because

you know you know there's crazy people out there

and when you're walking and somebody just goes like this running up to you on the side you just

it's it's a natural reaction to protect yourself right and so you know people don't understand

like you don't grab somebody you don't know's face without letting them know and and you know

what i mean and and i didn't slap the person but like this person is still still upset about it

it's wild like i was at the party um before the streamer awards oh shit streamer awards are out

are we are you are we voting for me this year i've never i've never get nominated for a streamer

nobody ever votes for the league of their own do we try to get me on the red carpet so i can make

a fool of everybody i should do a command on that nominate for league of their own i love how they

do league of their own somebody who does something um it says league of their own it says one of a

kind content pioneering a niche or category no one else does and last year like they were all

people who like some of them were different they did different things but like some of them were

just like i was like wait how does that even qualify we gotta do this we gotta get my ass

there even if i don't win we gotta get my ass to the red carpet just to see how i act all right i'll

put this in the thing i'll make a command maybe this week i've never i always tell you guys not

to vote for me because it's fucking weird like i always like don't vote for me because i don't

want to fucking because it feels weird but nah we're gonna do it this time we're gonna see if

we can do it so i'm gonna send it to you guys here okay if you want go there and under a league of

their own nomination put the stock guy we'll see if we get nominated if we do then my ass is going

to be hilarious because they're gonna be forced i'm not gonna never mind i'm not gonna tell the

lore i accidentally wrote the ia talk guy i just think it'd be hilarious to see the stock guy at

the fucking nominated for an award i'll nominate you if you give me a signal stepsister plug coming

you know damn well if i i'm not gonna win but if i do win you know a hundred percent i will stay

stepsister in my acceptance speech that is not even a question

how i get it in there i don't know but a hundred percent i will say stepsister

in the acceptance speech that there's there's no question there's no fucking question you voted

for me in every category okay you didn't need to do that we'll talk about it more um but yeah so

what happened was is i was at a party pre pre award the night before and uh it's the first time

we all got to meet each other because of covid and i was talking to everybody and i was bullshit

and i had come off of gamestop so i got to know a lot of people that i didn't know like uh

a lot of them and then one guy comes running up to me and he goes yo stock guy he's like i'm a huge

fan of your show i love your your content you're really awesome his name was uh was a hungry box

and he was just a really nice guy and i was like oh thanks man you know whatever

and uh and so it was cool but everybody had been drinking except me i was i didn't drink but

he comes up and he's like showing a card trick or whatever i can't remember the exact things but

he's like um he's like uh you know pick a card and he's like pick a card and he's like pick a card and

whatever like that and then he's like he's like all right now you know grab the card or whatever

like that he's doing this trick and he says now he says uh look at it and i and i was looking down

he goes no and he grabbed my face to point my like he just grabbed my chin to point to like to like

tell me to look and i wasn't expecting that and i was also in a large crowd of people

and i get a little bit anxiety when i'm like shoulder shoulder in a large busy crowd of people

especially ones that i don't know and he just i wasn't looking somewhere else he just grabbed my

face and all i did was just just all he was just like grab his arm and like shove it down just

because it was i wasn't like i wasn't you know i mean like it's weird you know you're not expecting

that you're also like a bunch of people you don't know and it's a very you know busy you know very

crowded place and you're a little uncomfortable and you're having a good time and somebody just

grabs your face it's just a natural reaction and then everybody starts making this joke of how i

like punched him or beat him or like slapped him or whatever and like and i felt bad because like

the the hungry box you know the guy hungry box he was such a nice genuine dude and it wasn't me

oh i gotta prove a point here it was just a natural reaction somebody i'm already on you

know anxiety i'm already in this crowd and somebody grabs my face and i'm not expecting

it i just grab you know i just just do that and like but like since then the dude like hates me

and like i even tried like talking to him one time and dude like ignored me i raided him one time like

i was you know and and like i'm not one of those people where like i feel the need to like build

bridges or whatever but like if there's a misunderstanding i want to make it clear but

the the joke now is is that i hit this guy

or i punched this guy or i beat up on this guy or whatever it's not the case

is there a clip no because this was at a private party and like the only streamer who ever said

they were a fan of me i fucking assaulted i didn't assault him actually they assaulted me but

well they didn't assault me they okay let me just use my words correctly they it was it was a

misunderstanding but like there's no way to there's no way to like you know fix that i think

there's egos involved not his but just streamers overall and there's just like this idea of like

are you gonna embarrass me or like or are you and i didn't want that like i genuinely thought he was

a really nice guy when i met him uh he was just super he was just super like friendly and he was

a friend of the show and like but i mean i didn't know how else to react like i'm not like a violent

guy but but i'm also somebody who like if if if you know it's natural instinct if somebody grabs

me especially when i'm already on edge because i'm in like a very crowded place like i'm gonna

you know i didn't punch anybody or hit anybody just like i just grabbed the arm and put it down

because like it's just like you don't know you don't you're not expecting to get your face grabbed

did did people did bro just shove people's arm the whole con no no i pushed the arm down of the

other at this con it's because you embarrassed him in front of his friends you should be proud

he learned boundaries that day you know what it's fair i guess i did probably accidentally do that

it wasn't my intention anyway and i'm the one who's reaching out trying to like for five years

been trying to make amends and even if he doesn't want to you know be friendly again because that

was not like we're gonna be friends anyways as long as he knows

my intentions were the way they were because i'm never that guy who's trying to be tough

like i joke about it have a good time but like i just want to be people's friends you know or at

least be friendly with people that i like and i just want to get along as much as possible like

i'm not gonna fucking fake it but like i'm not looking for confrontations like just like with

that mike from pa guy the the whatever like i had the opportunity to embarrass like him or at least

try to like make a you know whatever because of what he said and i was like you know not worth it

let me just talk to the guy you know what i mean like we're not we don't disagree i probably

99 of the shit that we've ever come across and i don't like i'm not trying to be his friend but i

was like let me just talk to the guy let me just i don't want confrontation you know it's funny if

it's on camera for content but like in my personal life i don't want confrontation i either want to

deal with you or don't want to deal with you but i don't i'm not looking for confrontation i think

that that's something that um i think that that's something that as you get older and you get more

confident in yourself as a as a person as a father mother as an adult you just kind of realize you

sometimes that whole like trying to be the tough person ends up not only making you look weak but

also makes you makes other people not want to be around you and you're like it's like when i'm out

with my wife if some driver is being an asshole and cuts us off or whatever flips me off or honks

the horn or whatever i don't fucking like try to race after them to cut them off or flip them off

to show them who's boss because number one i'm putting my family's life in danger number two

that person could be a nut we're in florida pull out a gun and number three what the fuck am i

proving somebody walks past me and i'm out with my family and they bump me i'm not gonna turn

where you're going and if they turn around and they're i'll just say excuse me even if i'm not

at fault if they turn around and go hey man watch where you're going like yeah my bad man and they'll

be like oh yeah yeah and i just keep walking yeah but you're a pussy stalking no i'm not

that means i'm a grown-ass fucking man and i take care of my family why because is it really worth

me getting into a fucking fight or fucking end up in jail or dead because i need to prove that i'm

a fucking man in that moment hell no it doesn't now if that son of a bitch starts coming after me

or my family and fucking dead to the death i'll rip

his fucking throat out and fucking drink his blood in front of his wife okay i'll literally

rip i'll just open up his fucking chest cavity take his heart out and fucking tell give it to

his kids in their hand and say there's daddy's heart happy valentine's day little timmy don't

be a bitch like your dad but as far as like if there's not a need for that like i'm not gonna

fuck around with it i don't need to i just don't need to you know what i mean i just really don't

need to you know i think people really need to i think people really need to to understand that

don't that's not how you prove yeah but then my wife will think i'm a bitch no he won't your wife's

probably gonna think you're a fucking better husband and father thinking damn my husband

doesn't need to fucking prove himself to some fucking loser and he thinks about us first if

your wife knows that you would fucking murder an entire fucking village of women and children if

it meant saving your fucking family that's all you need to know right that's the protection that's the

that's the that's the the strength that you project

that your family would nobody fucked with your family but you don't have to go out of your way

to fucking you know fight people and fucking prove points and shit like that no people actually look

at that as weakness because they think you don't have the confidence to be able to hold your own

that you need to go out and prove yourself who needs to prove themselves people who have low

confidence as teddy roosevelt once said walk quietly but carry a big stick why did you have

to murder children and things oh because i watched that um that uh that that first

episode for free of that hawaiian jason momoa and the hawaiian um islands uh uh uh series has

anybody watched that i grew up in hawaii so i'm watching it from a different perspective all right

we gotta get the fuck out of here you're killing spy i'm sorry where where is it dying i'm sorry

did is are you referring to to that that right there oh this is just the last three days by the

way remember you guys that were all crying about the market last week remember that remember

it's over i'm gonna lose everything it's fucking over

this was wednesday we bought the dip and now we're selling the rip by the way we're at number 25

all-time highs this year last year we had 53 all-time highs this year we've had 24 all-time

highs there are still people out there that are saying it's gonna fall they sold in april when

the tariff thing happened they're saying the market's just outpacing it hasn't understood

tariff it's gonna fall they sold in april when the tariff thing happened they're saying the

tariff's yet you guys don't get it it's gonna crash big time you'll be happy that you're if you

know you'll be sad that you're not all cash like i am right now sorry little bro i'm not saying i

know everything but the market ain't gonna wait for you he is widely known the smash community

to be an attention-seeking whiny bitch so don't feel bad about that who the fuck are you talking

about why the fuck is trump coin up 20 right now is he manipulating shit again i still have like

10 coins i should sell that for my roth ira how do you feel about only holding vt

you're talking about vti you're talking about the total ward the total world sometimes people

mislead the big i mean total world is fine i mean if you want to capture you know i think the

european market's gonna have a pullback i think they're gonna cool down from their from their run

um but i mean total world is fine i guess i mean you can look at vt versus vt uh versus

vu if you want or vti right so here's total stock market and you can add um vt to it and see

obviously past performance is not you know indicative necessarily of a future performance

but if you look at year to date on these i mean you can see that that they're basically step in

line you know a little bit more on vt right now because of the european um jump that happened

earlier this year right but if you look at the on the five year here they're basically lockstep i

mean vti is performed by what 10 percent more that's it and since since uh 20 to 2009

obviously vti has outperformed by double because u.s market is the best market right

now and it's the biggest market it's the one that drives the rest of the world so

again to you your own i mean i would pick vti over vt personally just because we're so we're

so connected internationally now that like you don't have to worry about hedging with the rest

of the world's markets if the u.s market collapses all the markets collapse but that's just my

opinion oh shit we gotta go i gotta go i gotta get ready for this i have a big day with stuff

and i got a bayos thing you know it's funny as you you know it doesn't matter how realistic you

are you still a part of you just hopes for really good news really hopes for good news vt's too

international heavily in my opinion i think so too i mean i would rather you know just own vti

and maybe some individual country uh etfs or some stocks from them i still think vietnam might have

another run all right what is it today's date 10.27.2025 d gens what did we learn today hit

me with it stream rewards nominations yeah go go nominate me league of their own i've never i

always tell you guys not to do this kind of shit but i'm gonna tell y'all to do it anyways

red carpet and i'm telling you right now if i win 100 i will i will i will drop stepsister in my
