Is buying the Netflix dip and holding the Stranger Things finale next month viable?

I don't know.

I took puts on it through earnings for my reasons.

Hold on.

Let me buy some Sava shares for a day trade.

Hold on.

All right.

Pony's still going.

We're doing really good on that one.

WeRide's holding up pretty good.

Did just take a Sava trade.

This is off their scientists getting cleared of criminal charges.

Stranger Things.

Isn't Billy Bobby Brown like 35 now?

Jesus fucking Christ.

He's like 18, bro.

You just made yourself sound really fucking weird.

Thanks for the SoFi signal on Tuesday.

This isn't a signal service, little bro.

You got to stop that shit.

Oh, my God.

I'm getting bailed out on my, not bailed out, but my Capital One calls.

I'm green.

That should not have happened.

Thanks for the owl signal.

I played owls like three times yesterday.

It only took a 54% day for me to get 10% up.

No, I played owls like three.

Three times yesterday.

It was a good play, like three times.

Okay.

So I'm in Sava at about 1,000 shares at 396.

I'm up 1% now.

I've got a 4% trailing stop loss on that.

So we're going to see how that plays out.

I usually don't take too many plays after open, but if I have a Catalyst pre-market, I will.

Pony, did we get stopped out yet?

Not yet.

Getting close.

How do you keep your sex drive high in your late 40s?

Is it that you don't have a high sex drive or the person you're with you don't have a sex drive with?

I think there's two different ways.

I don't know.

There's two different things there.

You don't have?

Well, I don't know, man.

I mean, I'm not a doctor, but oftentimes it can be your diet can be really a big deal.

If you don't eat well, your body feels lethargic.

If you're out of shape also.

If you smoke, your blood isn't, you know, it thins out and shit like that.

It's cardiovascular issues.

Honestly, can I be real with you?

Exercise, man.

Like when I go to the gym and I work out.

And I get all those that dopamine, all those endorphins going and I just I'm whatever I get a good workout and I come back and I and I cool down like I just want to fuck the shit out of something, you know, I mean, like usually it's a bottle, it's like a jar of hair gel or something, but like if my wife is down, I'm down, you know what I mean?

But no, I don't know, man.

I mean, everybody has their own thing.

A lot of times it's it's you know, it's your diet and your exercise is a big thing.

Also, if you're depressed, you're not you're not really you don't you don't really feel it as much.

So.

So sometimes, you know, picking up, you know, a new hobby or or or or or getting, you know, meeting people that are, you know, make you happier to be around a lot of things like that.

Poor ditto.

What did she say?

When I work out, I have to work out to exhaustion or I'm angry after.

Yeah, but you can have angry sex, Kaiser.

I'm just saying, like, everybody's different.

But the general consensus is, is if your your sex drive is low, it could be because you're not attracted to your partner.

And that's something you got to work on together.

If it's not that it's just it's just you.

It's usually because you're.

You're either, you know, you're you're you're bad diet or you're you know, you're out of shape or you don't have, you know, you know, or you smoke or whatever.

There's a lot of things like that.

And so oftentimes it's either your diet, lack of exercise or or you're you're like depression or something like that.

Anxiety, stuff like that.

Your body just doesn't respond to that.

Then I get angrier.

That sounds like fun.

My man is never in the mood.

OK, well, maybe you need to, like, put him in the mood.

You probably have never had this, probably.

But.

Some of us can't even stick it all the way in.

Well, sir, then you need to work on you need to work on what your mouth can do.

Why are we talking about this on Friday?

Guys, it's it's it's nine minutes into the market.

It's nine minutes in the market.

Can we please do some stuff like this?

You started.

I didn't start it.

I just need to stop reading chat.

Did you get we ride for shares or in the money?

I'm playing shares today.

You're 18 percent of owls.

What are you talking about?

When the doctor was sewing you up, I said, hey, it's too early.

Don't.

So.

You know, don't sew it all the way closed.

He goes, why?

I said, it's fourth whole Friday, Doc.

Oh, my God.

How long are we holding?

Pony, we ride.

I don't know about you.

I am holding we ride long term and pony is a day trade.

But here's where my brain goes.

And the timing this morning was a little suspicious.

I'll give you that.

But obviously, I didn't know.

So this morning we got news that Uber and Nvidia are partnering.

Right.

And they said that.

In.

In video is collaborating with Uber on autonomous vehicles.

And so I told I was talking.

I was just bullshitting in discord this morning.

I said, that's good for we ride as of right now, because Nvidia still has that that weird stake and we ride.

And if Nvidia is partnering with them on autonomous vehicles, it sounds like they're going to be data mining, data harvesting, and they could utilize that for whatever position they potentially may work with on.

We ride the future.

So I said, this is very positive for we ride.

And somebody said, yeah, one day, whatever.

Three minutes later.

Three minutes later.

Three minutes later, we get an announcement that's different, but just weird timing that we ride and Uber are also partnering Uber and we ride are offering autonomous robo taxi passenger rides in Saudi Arabia.

And I had just gotten into we ride for my day trade off of the other data from earlier in the morning.

And it's just interesting.

So these are obviously small things like it's not like pony where it's like pop pops and drops, whatever.

It's more of like, OK.

Because my theory and again, if you guys are trading or investing in we ride because of one Twitch streamers fucking random theory, then you got bigger problems and then I can help you with.

But the theory for me is, again, is that Nvidia has this big circle jerk going on with all of these companies that they're invested in with money.

And they've got this little, little tiny, quiet position in we ride.

Why?

Why do you have a position in that?

Why do you have a position in a small autonomous vehicle robo taxi company?

And as long as they're in it.

I'm going to go with the theory that they are going to pull them into the fold eventually.

Right now, there's a big there's a big orgy going on between Oracle and Nvidia and AMD and open AI and and and and and, you know, core weave and cores.

And we ride is in the chair in the cup chair in the corner watching at some point he's going to get tapped in.

Right.

And I don't know when that's going to be.

At least that's my theory.

Now, pony.

The reason I'm playing it on the day was all the autonomous.

Vehicle, all the robo taxi news with Uber, Nvidia and we ride.

But pony said that they are that they just released their their their they rolled out their 300th arc Fox Alpha T5 robo taxi.

So I'm I'm a weird trader.

I get it.

But the idea is, is that if all this robo taxi news is happening on the same day and then pony also rolls out their 300th robo taxi the same day, given that catalyst and that boom, that's why I figured it might move.

And so that's why I got into.

Pony this morning and it's fucking moving right now.

It's got volume to how do you beat Bloomberg terminal news like you got news in the same like them like, you know what I mean?

No, I don't.

I don't beat Bloomberg, but I Bloomberg terminal because here's the thing, you know, if you are an institutional size trader and it really matters and you need like seconds, then something like a Bloomberg terminal is the most important.

But a lot of the news I rely on has a Bloomberg terminal gets it from Blue Turtle.

So it's maybe a couple of minutes delayed.

Sure.

I might miss the initial.

Move off of that, but it doesn't like it's not, you know, I mean, I'm not trading hundreds of billions of dollars.

So, you know, I like to trade momentum and sometimes it doesn't move until the initial buyers or sellers show up.

It's pony a day trade for you long term.

No ponies a day trade for me.

There goes.

We ride right there.

Nice.

Nice.

Nice.

Let's fucking go.

Our two main plays are killing it.

And there goes BSRR too.

It's a game where you want to know your secret to be known.

You just want to know it first.

No, no.

Because if you're the type of trader.

Who who's trying to rely on microseconds to trade, you are probably either trading too much leverage and going to blow up the account or you're you're spending too much money for for minimal gains.

Now, there are people that are high frequency traders that do it and it's good for them.

And but for most people, it's not.

Thanks for Lumen stocky.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'm back up 900 or 750% on it.

By the way, I just want to say I know I'm a dick, but I'm I'm I'm never.

Like 100% confident anything.

But when somebody comes in with 100% confidence, I like to put them on our little wall of fame.

Right.

And so broken bit or whatever.

I appreciate you.

When I finally opened up my first ever Ford position and you said LOL Ford and I bought a bunch of it for my long term portfolio because of the dividend everything else.

I want to say thank you because I have been collecting a massive dividend for it for for for three quarters.

And my my shares are insane, just like Beyond Meat when I took my Beyond Meat puts your Beyond Meat puts are cooked at 10.

All right at night.

Okay, I'll put an alarm on what happened your wolf calls in the end.

I think I made a thousand percent on on like 90% of them and I held a few left over and those went to zero.

Thanks for the signal on ONDS.

I paid my second mortgage.

Okay for your short-term placement.

Okay.

Do you ever play the stock itself or is it calls or puts 99% of your day trades?

Almost everything is day trades is I mean almost everything is shares.

I don't do I don't do options for day trades.

If I do it's like a long-term option and then I just you know, either way.

But but I again I don't play options because I'm trying to trade options as a way of getting you know, whatever I use options is leverage.

So instead of having to tie up $10,000 in equity with a five five percent stop loss five hundred dollar total, you know, max loss.

I'd rather just buy one leap for $500 and either I can actually make more money, but my max loss is the same as my shares, but I don't but there's $9,500 in equity.

I could put somewhere else.

You see what I mean?

Do you auto and reinvest all your divvies?

Absolutely 100% stocking up 66% of my Mattel calls.

Do I hold or sell?

You know what we were both I was going to take them with you, but but I ended up putting my money into something stupid instead like Capital One future stream when I am going to try.

Futures today, okay later today probably around noon.

All right, I am going to give it a shot.

You guys always say that I draw lines and I know I can predict the future and stuff like that and a company was watching my streams and said, oh you think you can do this.

Let's give it a shot.

So I'm going to try it.

I am going to try it.

Okay, I am going to try it.

All right, if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't but I'm going to need y'all's help that no futures because I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm going into this blind.

Okay.

All right.

Warm up the L counter.

Okay, fine.

You guys get you guys you guys you guys you're going to see it in real time.

You got this.

How can anyone hold long positions without recognizing you're holding the L for when the market crashes?

Which crash would they be holding an L long-term for right now?

If you could help me out here.

Which which crash was which one are you referring to?

Every crash that happens you got to sell high.

Why would you sell?

You just buy the dip.

What are you talking about?

You never sell.

Why would you ever sell?

Look at this chart and tell me why you would ever sell.

Why I don't get the idea.

Like do you think that that investor you'd ideally like to sell before the bubble pops?

No.

Why?

Because if you because here's the problem with trying to time it.

If you saw I'll give you an example in April.

Everybody kept yelling at me.

You're so stupid.

The markets dead.

It's over.

It's crashed.

Trump's ruined everything.

I'm like, no, this is this is this is not that's not how the market works.

And so people started selling and they started selling right here and they said whatever.

So when were they going to buy back in?

How do you know when the bottom is?

Well, if they if they said, oh, there's the bottom.

They missed it.

Kept going down.

Oh, they didn't catch the bottom.

It goes up.

This is just a fake bounce.

It'll come back down.

Shit.

Oh, well, it's just this isn't going to last forever.

Oh, tariffs haven't really done that.

And now you've missed out on everything.

So instead of trying to sell and buy back in.

You just let it happen.

And you have a dollar cost average which buys every day or every week or every month.

And while it falls, it's buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying.

And now you're buying all the way down.

So when it does rebound, you've got even more money.

You need more money to buy it.

Dollar cost averaging is your paycheck.

Every paycheck you buy a little bit, whatever, or you spread it out.

I'm not talking about people who are actively trading.

I actively trade with a small amount of money compared to everything else.

It was all my shits and long term boring shit.

Of course, I did use my fucking.

Tax money to buy the dip, but.

No, no, no.

You may have.

I'm not.

No, I'm to the guy that's talking right now.

You're completely justified in asking your questions because 99.999% of every stock person on the Internet or financial bro on the Internet is trying to sell you something.

So they're trying to convince you when you should sell and when you should buy.

And if you sell here, you buy here.

No, that's not how this works, man.

I'm the boring guy.

I'm the guy who this is what works.

And we know it works because it's always worked.

You don't try to do it.

No one has lost more money in the stock market than people who short the market.

And the second one is the ones who try to time the top and buy the bottom.

I mean, legitimately.

Oh, we got really.

Oh, bad news for bail.

Oh, shit.

Can I finish hearing?

We got to hospitalize him.

One second.

All right, let me let me give you guys marbles.

I got to figure something out.

Hold on.

Well, that's not what I was expecting this morning.

She said we need to hospitalize him immediately.

Like like she said.

Yeah, let me see what she said.

She wants to take us to an emergency room for hospitalization.

She said that is he got the blood work back and the enzymes in his liver and gallbladder are alarmingly and remarkably elevated.

I'll just call her back.

She said that it could be a severe infection.

It could be an obstruction or cancer.

And we need to.

We need to treat him.

We get him inpatient for a few days minimum immediately.

But you know, it's crazy as we were waiting till we went to Delaware to get new pet insurance.

And of course, this happens two weeks before.

And that's like, we'll talk about this off stream.

What are we going to do?

I'll call her back.

No, babe.

Things like this.

If you don't have insurance, it's going to cost us 20 something out up to $20,000.

So I'm just like, I really want to have this conversation on stream right now.

This is just weird.

Crazy timing, too.

We're a week before we move.

I mean, I took him last night.

The doctor's visit last night was $1,200 just for getting him fluids and his anti-inflammatory and his blood work.

All right.

I mean, hi, Misha.

No, we just had a call from the doctor and she left us a long voicemail and I was wondering if she's available.

Yeah.

Sorry, babe.

I should have full ported Pony this morning.

Sorry.

I'm not apologizing, guys, because obviously it's not.

This is a serious thing.

But it's just crazy.

It's crazy when you do live streaming like everything in your life is live.

Hey, there goes RAF if you guys took it.

Now, the first thing that goes through your head is, is the kids, because that's their best friend.

You know what I mean?

I got to go.

I'm not sure how to end the stream right now.

For forced, you just resubbed for 58 months.

Go do what you need to do, boss.

We will always be here.

Go love yourself.

Just resub for 59 months.

We're here for you, brother.

You know, life comes at you fast, guys.

Life comes at you fast.

Life comes at you fast.

And so just remember that.

Okay.

Takes just one phone call.

Yeah.

Listen, I'm all about the dark jokes.

I really am.

But if you could give me like a day before we start doing it, Marcus and all those guys like I get it.

I'm totally I'm not even mad at you because like I totally get the dark humor.

I'm like totally on board with it.

Like I do it all the time.

So I'm not even upset.

But like if you could give me five minutes before you do that.

That wasn't a joke.

Well, if you're serious or not, I don't care.

I just just just just give me five minutes before we do it.

Okay.

And then we'll do it.

Okay.

Capitalism.

It requires you exploitation.

I mean, fair.

You know what?

I'm not even mad that you guys are making the jokes because because, you know, you can't dish out shit like that and not take it.

So I'm not even mad at you guys for the jokes.

Like, it's shitty timing.

But, you know, that's fine.

It's my fault.

I should just not reach out right now.

We're family.

Family takes care of its own.

It's going to be a tough decision because depending on what they say, it's up for 13 months.

It's just we love you.

You know, you know, love.

You know, you love your your pets and stuff like that.

But the truth is, is sometimes, you know, when it when the cost is just too much, you know, you just have to make decisions.

But I'm going to I'm going to deal with that.

I got to take him immediately, immediately to the to the hospital.

So, yeah, I'm I'm I'm, you know, even then lose a sponsor and everything.

But it is what it is.

You know, I have I have to take him.

Take care.

Take care of my family.

This is just his dog.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But still, you know how it is with the dogs you've had since they were babies and you've raised a family with it.

You know, they're always part of your family.

You know, I mean, you know, especially the kids.

That's the toughest part.

That's the toughest part because they don't understand.

And that's their their best friend.

So I hate when you guys see me like this, but it's part of live streaming.

Who knows?

Who knows?

No pet insurance.

No.

Actually, we it lapsed because we were moving hospitals and moving states.

And so it lapsed.

He had a preexisting conditions.

It was very expensive, but it lapsed and we were just planning on picking it up in two weeks when we move.

And he got sick or he was getting bad while we were at TwitchCon.

And we came back and I took him to the doctor yesterday.

You can seven years.

You can pay for insurance and nothing happens.

You lapse it for three weeks and then this is what happens.

So they need him in the hospital before it's too late.

So I got to go.

Yeah.

Have a good weekend.

I'll see you guys on Monday.

Okay.

That's all I got.

That's all I got.

That's all I got.

Before I go, though, I just want to say I appreciate you guys.

Appreciate you guys.

You guys mean a lot to me.

And thank you for for everything.

And I don't take you for granted.

Or this.

This.

This thing.

You know, it's a really good thing I got going on.

And, you know, through all the shit, it's nice to know that go live every day and we get to hang out and have a little fun.

And, you know, I got it good.

I got it good.

And I know that.

So thank you guys for for being here and for everything.

It really does mean a lot.

I just don't know how to say it.

So stay green, you DJs.

See you guys on Monday.

Okay.
