Alright, well good morning. 50-year mortgages? I can do a breakdown of 50-year mortgages if you want.

That should be real fun and depressing.

Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to my guy who said he'd glide out.

By the way, our line on Friday was nuts, wasn't it? We called the exact bottom.

I don't know how we did that, but that was kind of wild.

Alright, here we are. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Alright, casino's open. I am playing.

I gotta get on my Monday calls if it drops under.

I am in CXW. I am in a little bit of NIVF, SLE, and Celsius.

Keeping an eye on Monday. I would like for it to be under 152.

But let's go ahead and look and see all of our stuff.

Oh my god, we are up massive today. What are we up on the most?

We got a lot of stuff popping right now.

Alright, let's take a look at Monday. Leg in here.

I have shares. Big up on the day.

Gonna buy a little bit of Oscar this morning.

I don't believe Trump. Don't ask me why.

But let's go ahead and take a look at Monday.

Waiting for the volatility. It's coming down. It's coming down here.

I want it to be under 151.

Let's see if I can get in. Okay, that didn't work.

Sorry again.

Don't want to go crazy here.

Alright, I'm gonna leave this order in.

And if it gets filled, it gets filled. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

I have shares, but I don't want to chase this.

If it gets filled, it gets filled. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

Alright, CXW is flying. This is the one that is doing a

a $200.

Or $200 million additional buyback.

So I'm grabbing some of this pre-market.

And going to be keeping a close eye on it.

Got my stop loss in.

And then we also jumped into Celsius this morning.

They're doing a $300 million buyback on their spot.

SLE is there and NIVF. We already got stopped out.

No, we didn't get stopped out yet. We're close.

I have a 10% showing stop loss on this.

Plug big news this morning as well.

Let's get our stop losses in.

But everything.

Everything is popping right now. We do got a lot of stuff going on right now.

Um, okay. We got stopped out there. Alright.

I'm going to have to run this again here in a minute.

This one's kind of crazy. I don't know if I'm somebody's exit liquidity or not.

But I'm going to find out real quick.

Um, alright.

CXW still flying.

We got SLE this morning and Celsius. We got our stop loss on it.

Uh, don't know if I got filled on my money. I got my Monday shares.

ELF?

Yeah.

It was between ELF and RH, uh, for me, um, for me on, um, what was it?

Um, on, uh, Wednesday or Thursday last week.

Yeah, I'm not going to chase Monday.

If it, if it fills, I got the shares from this morning, but if it fills it, it, um, they go, it, we'll see.

We'll see what's happened to ourselves.

What is this?

Did y'all really take an old ass picture of me from when I was trying to be a YouTuber and, and, and AI that shit?

Okay.

It's too early for this crap.

Thank you so much.

Barth.

You just saved my ass.

All right.

So spy moving.

We talked this morning about the, um, government shutdown and, uh, what the likelihood is of it, uh, of it ending.

I don't think it's going to end right away.

We've got, even if the Senate does get the eight Democrats to come in, um, the house has said they're not going to, they're not going to pass it.

So, you know, I don't know where we're, uh, we're, we're going to go with this, but, um, you know, that at least that's what we're hearing.

We're hearing that they are going to, uh, uh, come together on this.

And, um, you know, fuck, I want to take Oscar calls, but I feel like Monday's the better one.

I'll just take more Oscar shares.

I just got some at 1550, um, healthcare stocks getting beat up this morning on, um, uh, Trump saying that he's going to do payments directly to Americans, uh, for their, uh, for their, um, uh, healthcare costs.

Now, again, it sounds more like, uh, uh, something he's doing.

Hey, little bill.

Thanks, man.

It sounds more like something that he's doing.

Just.

Just for, um, just for the, um, aesthetics, uh, to get the, the, the Senate Democrats to come over, uh, and, uh, and, and, you know, basically, basically just have them come over and say, yeah, you know, I'm working towards, you know, getting these, uh, these healthcare subsidies and everything in play.

And, uh, I, I don't believe it.

I don't believe it's true.

I could be wrong.

So I am grabbing the Oscar dip.

Some people are buying the UNH dip on this.

All right.

We got 6% on Celsius.

CXW.

We are flying on CXW.

I'm gonna go ahead and put a 3% stop loss on CXW.

And again, this is a private prison.

So I told you guys this morning that obviously, uh, you know, for moral reasons, some of you guys wouldn't want to play this, but, uh, uh, it was an additional $200 million buyback for them.

And there goes SLE.

This is our toe for YOLO today.

How are we doing on that so far?

Looking pretty good.

Looking pretty good.

I full ported SoFi monthlies instead of weeklies.

Excellent decision.

Yes.

Never, never, never do dailies and weeklies if you can avoid it.

The Dems are so stupid for caving.

It actually makes the shutdown their fault.

Now snap benefits are on the choppy block every year.

They gain zero by opening.

Wow.

That's, uh, that's a lot to start the day with.

There goes Monday.

At least our shares are doing pretty good.

All right.

Let's start legging out some other stuff here.

I think the craziest thing though, um, from a political nature is, uh, oh, wow.

We got bailed out on our soundhound calls.

Grocery stores have been less busy though.

That's good.

Um, you're going with Oscar calls or waiting.

I'm just doing Oscar shares.

I'm trying to get in on Monday.

I tried to get on a Monday calls, which sucks because those are flying right now, but I think it could take longer for Oscar.

Monday is just, as we talked about during the call this morning, Monday feels like it's a bit oversold off of the lower guidance because that lower guidance isn't that bad.

Um, I know this is, this market punishes anybody who doesn't have exponential, uh, growth, um, lined up, but music is too loud.

Oh, thank you.

What is this sex music?

What kind of boring ass sex are you having?

When are we getting out of hive leaps?

I haven't even looked at my hive leaps yet.

Sup stock guy found you near end of COVID.

Good to be back.

Hey, good to have you back, man.

So streams a lot different since then, but, uh, good to have you here.

We're not doing a tier list of sex music, at least not yet.

Also, I just want to let you guys know, um, we're all going to jail for Kodak.

I know the reason we got into Kodak was kind of wild, but, um, yeah, we're probably going to get jailed.

We're all going to jail for Kodak.

But, um, yeah, we're probably going to get jailed.

We're probably going to get jailed.

Yeah, we're probably going to get in trouble.

People are going to be wondering why a bunch of idiot degenerates, um, got into a dead, uh, film company.

We did it because it's IRL loot boxes, but this is just since, just since Friday, 40%.

And that's where we got in right there in September.

Now, I remember the whole reason we got in was because of their little IRL loot boxes.

We thought that was going to bring extra revenue in.

And, uh, they didn't, they didn't acknowledge.

They didn't acknowledge that directly during their earnings, but they had a surprise, uh, income come in.

And, um, it, it, they didn't say it directly, but, you know, it is what it is.

All right, I'm going to cancel my Monday call because the IV is just too high right now.

What does that mean? Why are you an idiot?

Yeah, Oscar calls look attractive.

By the way, guys, our JetBlue calls, um,

um,

but we went from down 40% to now up 50%.

It's not a big position because obviously it was very speculative.

But, um,

and this is why I tell you guys, if you are going to play, um,

options, remember you're using them as leverage, not as a way of like making a shitload of money.

And you have to take further ones out.

Luckily, this was, you know, a month and a half out, but they were at the money.

But most of the time you're going to want them at least six months to a year out because it sounds like,

oh, we're going to have to take them out.

Oh, I could get 20 for the price of one if I just get a weekly.

Yeah, but if you're wrong, you lose everything.

But if you're right, yeah, but then you won't sell the top.

You'll hold and then you'll hold overnight and the theta will destroy you.

All right, so I'm going to go ahead and close these five of them here.

Yeah, Oscar, Oscar really.

CNC, yeah, I like, I know, but Oscar feels like it's got more of that rotation.

Although what we are noticing is, is that, uh, is that, uh, uh, retail traders are being more cautious this dip.

All right, I'll leg into some Oscar calls.

Um,

the December 26, 15 fives are only a, uh, only a buck nine, a buck 80 a piece.

What's the drone ticker you like?

Um, I'm in D pro.

There goes SLE guys.

SLE looking really good.

I'm in D pro, but I think that an ONDS we played, um,

I think KTOS is probably going to be more likely to get those big government contracts.

What's the $2,000 YOLO?

I mean, I think Monday is going to have a good bounce.

There you go.

Celsius.

Let's go.

Remember Blas.

I love how you always say anything I buy is stupid.

You're like, Ooh, those are those, those, those, those Celsius play was doom.

Okay, buddy.

$300 million buyback.

I'll take it.

All right.

Did we get stopped out of CXW?

We have a 3% trillion stop loss.

All right.

Palantir 6% today, guys.

Google up 3%.

SoFi up 6% back to 30 bucks.

Guilt up 4%.

Joby up 5%.

Microsoft one and an E two and a half.

NVX 11% right now.

TSSI we, we added on Friday, 4% up MNTS have a nice little bump here.

Let's go ahead and put a, put a stop loss on some of those shares.

All right.

SLE is doing really well right now.

We're up seven and a half percent on that.

Got in a little bit late.

Got it at 1 23.

That's the toe for YOLO Celsius.

7% Gers up.

D pro moving a little bit here.

You use up 6% guts is up.

MLG O's up.

I think I'm done playing MLG.

Oh, I've got it.

I made some good money swinging that up and down, but I think I'm done playing it.

What is this sexy skin and max playlist?

What do y'all do?

What's wrong with this playlist?

You guys.

All right.

So the main plays that we're in today took a small L on that NIV thing.

I'm going to get it.

If it falls to 47, uh, CXW is a huge winner this morning.

Um, SLE is up Celsius is up and a Monday shares are up.

So, so far we're, uh, we're, we're knocking it out of the park.

Uh, even though the market was already up, I got an IPHA today.

Stock eight.

What is IPHA?

I feel like that's something we played recently.

Try to relax your anus.

Oh, nice.

That's 13% game.

Delaware has changed you.

What did I do?

You probably get this a lot coming in for a long time.

What's your view on AI?

I mean, AI is legitimately going to be, you know, the future.

I feel like personally that we're actually further along than we think and that the government

is being very, very cautious in, in, in allowing the rollout to happen too fast because they

can't have mass, you know, um, uh, uh, unemployment people not having.

Something to do and being very, very bored and poor, uh, that leads to very, very, uh,

likelihood of, uh, of, of, of like, you know, uh, uprisings and stuff, uh, as far as my

view on it is as the future.

I mean, Americans want to be lazier.

If you want to get rich in America, you make Americans lazier.

It's always been that way.

Um, and AI does that.

The question is, is, does AI is, is, is what the, the value that AI makes for companies

worth what it does, what it hurts as far as economic output is there is, where's the

offset there?

How much, how much money is saved versus how much money is lost?

And I don't know.

The question is, is you're asking me a question where I just, I can't tell because we can

all guess what's going to happen, but AI is not gonna put everybody out.

Cause it reminds me of, did you get any beyond puts, uh, two weeks ago?

Yes.

But I sold them way too early.

Um, I'm not all doom and gloom.

Because if you look at history, the same thing happened during the industrial revolution,

not the same thing, but something similar when the industrial revolution happened and

we started having factories, you know, and, and, and large scale mass production, the

idea was, is everyone was going to be out of work, right?

Everyone would be unemployed because machines were going to do everything for us, but those

machines just brought about new industries.

And so I think AI will also do something similar.

You see?

See what I mean?

I don't know what it's going to be yet, but that's, that's my thought.

Again, just my personal, my personal take on it.

I mean, anything could happen, but it, it just feels that that's, that's kind of something

nobody's talking about.

All right.

What do we got moving?

Did you get into rum?

It's entering the cloud business with tether.

We talked about that this morning on the call.

Uh, rumble had two pieces of news this morning.

One was that, um, they, uh, uh, they bought, uh, the German AI firm, Northern data for

767 million.

And they got the a hundred million dollar advertising commitment from tether.

Monday started tanking.

Once you pointed them out, we got into Monday pre-market and then we were trying to get

into calls here.

So I'm not sure what that means, but you're right.

I got fucked on beyond calls, but my beyond puts will never hit either.

Are you aware of what implied volatility is?

Thanks for reminding me to buy the dips.

Well, I mean, this was a very small dip.

Our Joby calls are doing great.

As you're trying too hard today.

Just for subbed for 22.

Months boops.

Uh, I like to buy dips and sell rips.

I just leg in leg out.

I'm sorry.

I should not have drawn the line.

That's my fault.

I am so sorry.

I fucked up.

I'm sorry, guys.

What do you think of Tesla?

Is it a good time to buy since it's gone down a bit or wait until it goes down more?

Do you think, do you think Tesla's going to be worth more or the value of the stock is

going to be worth more in a year, five years or 10 years from it is now.

Then you buy it markets fallen, but everything we're in is up.

CXW still flying, uh, SLE still up Celsius still going.

It's following the line.

I know.

I'm sorry.

Where's the link for the Patriot on.

I need the signal service.

This isn't a signal service, bro.

Um, what was the other one that we were talking about earlier?

Can you buy futures next time you draw a line?

Yeah, but I'm not going to do it until, uh, I do this, the sponsored segment.

Although the last time I did it was the last week and we got it.

Also, I don't know how we did this, but we nailed the exact bottom of spy on Friday.

Remember when I was like, this guy was like, I'm glad.

I got out of the casino while it's still closed.

And I said, dude, I think it's about to reverse here.

And I drew this circle in this line.

That was the exact bottom of spy.

That was wild timing.

Look at that.

Spy is up 17 and a half dollars since that moment.

And the amount of you guys that took calls at that time scares me.

How did you know the bottom?

I didn't know the bottom.

This was, this was where we were at right before Trump started talking

with the Hungarian prime minister.

And, um, it was just one of those it's, I was looking for a catalyst and that was the.

Catalyst.

So I said, uh, if you go back on streams Friday, I just said he's about to talk with this guy.

Um, and, and, and they were late and I said, he's about to do it.

So this, this feels like it's, there's going to be some kind of talk of either, uh, uh, you know, uh, precious

metals, mineral deal or, or something where he's gonna go off the rails about the economy.

So I just figured it was, it was a, it was a, everybody was looking for a catalyst.

I bought the calls.

I'm up 180%.

You're insane.

All right.

Palantir crazy today.

So far Google's up 3% today, by the way, Joby up 6%.

Microsoft one and a half.

Sold those Microsoft calls on Thursday for a gain, whatever we'll see, uh, NBX 8%.

We got stopped out of some of those shares there.

Hive, uh, gave some of it back, uh, TSSI still looking good, waiting for GPUs to run.

We got that under 36 Celsius, seven and a half percent guts is up 3%.

Why am I in guts again?

I mean, I know, I know why I've been in some guts, but why am I in guts?

Wow.

I sold some Evgo this morning when it was up 10%.

It's now down 3%.

That might be a, that might be.

Okay.

Bounce play the 10 year treasury was, uh, was up.

So it makes sense that, uh, that, uh, um, spec and growth stocks are down a little bit here.

The chase who just resubbed for 24 months.

Stop drawing lines in the down.

I'm not, no, no.

What I think, oh, I think everyone's going to go.

I'm going to buy here.

I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to try to, I'm gonna try this.

I I'm not, I'm going to put a, um, half stop loss at, uh, four or 4% half at six.

Actually, you know what?

No.

Um, I'll put it two.

And 4% I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to have a tight stop loss today.

Give me a 3% average Evgo earnings are today.

You know what that means?

Right?

Nice.

Goddamn Kodak still going.

What a wild play Evgo announced their earnings.

Oh, they did.

What was Evgo's earnings?

Like, let me take a look here.

I know.

I know I'm not being DGN right now, but it's Monday and we got a lot to do.

Revenue was up 36% or 36.7% year over year beat by a half mill charging network revenue.

Total 55 million.

Third quarter, 33% year over year.

15th consecutive quarter, double digit year over year.

Charging revenue growth.

I fucking love that.

Networks.

Uh, reached 95 gigawatts an hour, third quarter, 25% up year over year.

Added 280 new operational stalls.

Earned Q3.

Uh, 25% increase in stalls in operation.

201 million in cash, cash equivalents restricted cash.

Additional borrowing of 41 million.

Just even 5 million net cash use and operating capital expenditures.

26.

Um,

yeah.

I like that.

I mean, I've owned them for years, but

I really want to get into ins and outs of stock market.

Any beginner tips?

I mean, honestly, the less you know, the better, probably,

like, when it comes to, like, what I'm doing right here.

But the ins and outs of the market, like, understanding it,

here's all you got to understand.

It always goes up.

And when it falls, it just goes up again.

So, dollar cost average.

Set up a reoccurring buy on a total market ETF and forget about it.

But if you want to learn more about, like, the market and stuff,

I mean, go into Discord at the top where it says Stock Market for Beginners.

There's lots of GitHub links, all the free information you need.

Hang out in the chat, hang out in the stream,

and hang out in the Discord with all the little communities,

like, if you want to understand about 401ks and IRAs or investing.

It's not like I got mentors in there teaching you.

It's just people hanging out and talking.

Why is it two minutes of ads?

Oh, I can't. He can't hear me right now. There's ads.

Do you the CoreWeave earnings will have a significant impact on the market?

No.

The market has decided what it wants to do.

CoreWeave isn't going to be...

The CoreWeave is just in a circle jerk with...

There goes Kodak again.

How did we...

We nailed this, man.

I'm going to whiteboard a 50-year loan.

Yeah, don't worry.

Kodak.

You know what?

Kodak was a dumber play than GoPro, and we killed it on GoPro.

And the fact that we got into Kodak because we read some obscure thing about IRL loot boxes,

and now we're up 63% is insane.

Any fun plays for this afternoon, Stocky?

I mean, I just jumped into Evgo.

Oh, 71% now.

That's just insane.

I don't know how that worked out, but we'll take it, I guess.

I'm going to sell one here.

Yeah.

No, I haven't eaten anything yet.

Wii are up 70%.

I say Wii because it's just a weird thing about...

It's like the voices in my head kind of thing.

All right, Kodak's still going now.

Look at that volume that came in on Friday.

All right, I got a pretty tight stop loss on Evgo, but we're already up on it.

SLE we got stopped out of for...

Got stopped out at 129.

That's nice.

So now I got some capital.

I'll try Niv-F again.

I'll put a 10% showing stop loss on it, or 9% showing stop loss and see what happens.

I got most of my money in Evgo right now.

Can we switch back to the old green screen?

Why is Kodak up?

Well, Kodak had earnings and they beat expectations, had unexpected revenue.

The reason that I got into it was because a couple months ago we were doing some research

and we noticed that...

There was this new product they had that was causing people to kind of go nuts and sell out.

And it was for this like nostalgia camera.

And nostalgia is huge right now.

It's hitting huge right now.

And so I was looking at the Labubu thing and I said to myself,

people are spending money on dumb shit right now.

And when you look at where people are spending their money and they're doing it on these crazy,

like basically gambling.

And Kodak introduces this real world, you know, an IRL loot box.

I'm like, they're probably going to see a bump in revenue from this.

So because of that, I took, I took leaps for 2027 and it fucking, it worked.

The camera is still sold out.

Yeah.

Dumb shit.

I don't know.

I gave my seven-year-old niece Labubu for her birthday two days ago and she fucking loved it and said she

won a thousand more of them.

Everyone was jealous because she liked my gift the best.

I feel like that's less about helping us out.

Here and more about trying to convince us that you're a good person, which it's not doing.

You got a Yolo for me.

I'm an Evgo right now.

And I just sold one of my Kodak leaps for 80% and bought Oscar calls with it.

Oscar shares are mostly what I hold, but I grabbed a couple Oscar calls.

I'm actually down on them.

I got it for 170.

They're at 160 right now.

Average 170 right now.

Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to whiteboard to 50-year mortgage.

I got a lot of talk.

It was a lot of questions over the, over the weekend for some reason.

Somebody, more than one person asked me about it and more than one person asked me if they think it's a

good idea because it's within their, it's within their budget.

And I'm like, you know, I, I don't want to crush somebody's dream, but I have to be real with something.

Never ask me a question, whether it's on stream or in, in my DMs, if you don't want me to be brutally

honest with you.

Okay.

I don't care what the fuck the question is.

And I, and, and no, it's coming from a good place.

I'm never going to tell you something because I want to like hurt your feelings, but I'm going to be brutally fucking honest with you.

So if that's not something you can handle, don't, don't reach out to me.

If you ask me a question, I am going to give you a piece of shit.

I love to engage with people that I disagree with, no matter how stupid their fucking opinions are.

But she ain't going to cross my line, bitch.

I show my rules.

Suck it.

And I don't care.

I don't mean like the way you barely touched it.

Okay.

I'm not your uncle, your drunk uncle on Thanksgiving when you were 14.

No, I'm the stock guy.

I'm a throat goat.

Wait.

Oh my God.

I'm thinking of the blurb.

You know what?

Whatever.

There's so many things there that you really have to know.

I was telling him you could S my D, right?

And I don't want you just to do it.

And then I was basically telling him that he, you know, had the drunk uncle thing.

And then I was saying, and you're going to have to take.

Take care of it.

Good.

I know because I'm the, you know, it would it just let's listen to an actual penis or an actual dick.

Here you go.

A member of Congress to welcome you to what appears to be the beginning of the end of the longest government shutdown in US history.

As shameful as that is.

I don't think it's a coincidental, you know how I think, but it's after 40 days of wandering in the wilderness and making the American people suffer needlessly.

Some Senate Democrats.

Finally have stepped forward to end the pain.

It appears to us this morning that our long National Nightmare is finally coming.

Oh, now the house is possibly talking about passing some Democrats.

See now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.

But as we said from the beginning, the people's government cannot be held hostage to further anyone's political agenda.

I was never right.

And shutting down.

The government never produces anything.

It never has if you study history.

And so here we are.

I don't know what I want to remind everybody this morning of another critical point that you've heard me here repeat over and over over the last several weeks.

It's something that I and leader John Thune and and President Trump and every every Republican leader have all said repeatedly from the beginning.

We have always been open to finding solutions to reduce the oppressive cost of health care.

Under the unaffordable Care Act.

We just made clear that we would not and should not ever do that.

That is negotiate as hostage.

You'll be calls are killing also reminded you here every morning that this press conference throughout the shutdown Republicans have not just been talking about reducing costs and fraud and abuse in so many areas and in healthcare.

We've been actually passing new laws to accomplish that urgent mission for the people and we will continue to do so.

So here's where we are by way of schedule.

Just so you know, you're following.

You're thinking Republican looks up and says, hey, that's my Johnson that the Senate's vote last late last night of 60 to 40 opens the door.

Now, the Senate is moving forward on an amended House CR continuing resolution that will reopen the government until January 30th added to that or provisions to fully.

I look down every morning and say the same through the end of the next fiscal year, which is September 2026.

Guaranteed back pay for all federal workers who have been made to endure these hardships over the last several weeks.

And it also includes passage of three appropriations bills, which we're grateful to be moving through the process.

That is the military construction Veterans Affairs bill.

It's the agriculture bill and the legislative branch bill.

Jesus Palantir 7% session this morning to thanks for 80% on Joby.

This isn't a single service.

What they do.

They'll need unanimous consent from all senators to fast-track their final vote.

As you know, there's some procedural.

Hurdles that one or more could throw in the way.

But we certainly hope that they won't do that because so many people across this country are desperate for the government to reopen at the very moment that they do that final vote.

I will call all house members to return to Washington as quickly as possible.

We'll give a 36-hour formal and official notice so that we can vote as soon as possible to pass the amended CR bill.

I find stocking very smart.

You all know and he said as recently as.

Last night.

I was with him and he told the press.

He said we want to get the government open.

He's very anxious to get the government reopened and to end the Schumer shutdown.

We all are with regard to the travel challenges.

I suppose you were shut down link with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

My former colleague and good friend and he lamented the serious situation that we have with air travel in the u.s.

He's bent over backwards as all the administration and the cabinet have done and all of their areas of jurisdiction to try to keep the government working for the people and to mitigate the pain and the harm.

But the problem.

We have with air travel is that our air traffic controllers are overworked and unpaid and many of them had called in sick.

That's very stressful job and even more stressful exponentially when they're having trouble providing for their families.

And so air travel has been grinding to a halt in many places and as of Sunday nearly half of all domestic flights and u.s.

Flights were either canceled or delayed and it's a very serious situation.

So I'm saying that by way of reminder.

I'm stating the obvious to all my colleagues.

Republicans and Democrats in the house.

You need to begin right now returning to the hill.

We have to do this as quickly as possible and we look forward to the now reopening this week.

So Congress came back can get back to our regular legislative session.

We have a lot of business to do as you all know, and we will be working in earnest will be there'll be long days and long nights here for their foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.

I want to I want to close.

And with something that's important.

I think it's important to say that this is genuine.

I mean this sincerely.

We have all the seven Senate Democrats and one independent senator who did the right thing.

They decided to put principle over their their personal politics.

Every guy's by the dips.

All the ribs on the urgent plea of all my colleagues in the house.

That means every Democrat in the house is to to think carefully pray and finally do the right thing and help us to bring an end to the pain of the American people.

This is going on too long.

Too many people have suffered and it's long overdue.

That's the update.

I wanted to give you this morning.

There are probably lots of questions, but I'm going to get a lot of my own questions answered later today.

So stay tuned for more.

Thanks so much.

The next time you get in trouble.

I'm John Kennedy.

I approve.

I approve this message.

It's for rotation as an example, but okay on the inside of these sockets is really where all the hard work goes into.

And so inside that socket is batteries wires.

Sorry guys.

I had to go hours of work.

Apparently my kids but because we decided I wasn't around and wanted to we can control it and get it.

These are very bad things.

Yeah.

What did I miss with the crafting of the hands?

Absolutely, man.

So that is actually someone who comes in and hand.

Pain.

That for us the patients will sit and you know, yes, I don't do behind the couch activities.

I do in front of the couch activities.

I do all where's the air traffic controllers air traffic controller unions holding a talk right now.

No American should ever be forced to work without a page to not pay someone for the work that they have performed is un-American and is fit and failing to pay that workforce that keeps our sky safe.

It is not acceptable and it is not sustainable.

We embrace the responsibility.

We hold and the trust we are given this past weekend air traffic controllers ensure that over 7.3 million passengers arrived on time flying or arrive safely and flying over 113,000 flights.

They all arrive safely at their.

Destinations.

They did this despite continuing to operate with 3,800 fewer fully certified controllers than the system requires.

This is not a new issue.

God damn has been advocating for in keep increased controller staffing for more than a decade Secretary of Transportation.

Sean Duffy recognizes concern and implemented plans to supercharge controller hiring and modernize the air traffic control system.

We've shared the same vision.

We also thank him for his outspoken support of air traffic controllers and for ending this shutdown and we nailed the bottom of this shutdown have real consequences for hardworking patriotic American workers last Friday.

We delivered over 1,600 handwritten letters from our members to the congressional offices expressing the hardship that they are experiencing.

These are not.

Statistics.

These are not statistics.

These are the lives of people.

Who keep this country moving.

One of our members recently moved from Alaska to Illinois.

Any is in training at her new facility?

Her husband.

Of 20 years is a five time.

Combat veteran who has 45 documented explosions.

In seven direct hits and his service record.

He returns.

Weird fly.

Afghanistan.

With a.

with a traumatic brain injury diagnosis and 100% permanent and total service-related disability.

Consequently, she is the single source of income for her family.

Her son just graduated from Navy A school, fourth in his class,

but they could not afford to attend his graduation.

She's plagued by financial insecurity, and in addition to training at her new facility,

she has sold plasma twice, started delivering for DoorDash,

and recently took a part-time job on her regularly scheduled days off or day off.

A NACA member in Nebraska pays a $2,800 copay for a specialty medication

to treat his wife's autoimmune disorder and prevent it from becoming crippling.

After a month without pay, he's unsure how he's going to pay for the basic living expenses.

First off.

First off, that's fucked up.

Second of all, they're from Alaska.

Hell no.

We've heard from recent graduates of the air traffic control training in Oklahoma.

They are resigning and cannot begin this challenging new career without a paycheck.

We've heard from other air traffic controllers that are struggling to find ways to pay for gas

and to get to and from work, while others are struggling to pay for child care so they can go to work.

These are real people.

They're real Americans, and they are facing real problems.

These are real people.

They deserve better, and they absolutely deserve their pay.

The aviation safety professionals we represent are doing everything they can to continue to show up and deliver

America's passengers and cargo safely to their destinations.

Congress must immediately and end the government shutdown

and ensure that all individuals...

Congress must immediately and end the government shutdown and ensure that all individuals...

who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation.

Enough is enough.

Now, thank you, and I'll be happy to take your questions along with Amy and John.

Oh, my God.

Eli Lilly, my calls.

I can't look at this.

Well, air traffic controllers are showing up every day right now, day in and day out.

Your chat rules are weak, bro.

I say the tamest things that get in trouble.

What we're going to have to find out is how many actually resigned...

Then you don't understand what rules are.

...how many retired due to this shutdown...

Dumbass.

...and truly started assessing.

...and truly started assessing all the different impacts this shutdown's had.

We only have reports.

I've talked to Secretary Duffy.

We knew over last week it was four to five that had already resigned and growing by the day.

We don't have the exact timetables because we don't know when the government will fully...

Give him just a moment.

Make sure he's okay.

All right.

Somebody else passed out.

We don't know when the government fully opens up and what the pay schedules will look like.

All I can reference is what happened in 2019, and it took air traffic controllers approximately two to two and a half months...

...to get there.

They'll have to be able to be made whole from all their compensation.

They'll receive some early on compensation based off of previous pay, but then going back and air traffic controllers...

...then having to weed through paycheck after paycheck to see where they compensated for all the time that was missed.

Yes, sir.

We haven't directly engaged with it, but air traffic controllers across the country go through a rigorous training process.

They're highly skilled, highly trained...

How's y'all's day going?

...and it would take quite some time to have anyone else control the airspace that FAA controllers do day in and day out.

Administrator Bedford and Secretary Duffy would be the ones to determine if that process is going to move forward.

Go ahead, sir.

This is one of the worlds where this shutdown isn't a light switch.

It's not just on, and it's not just off.

Air traffic controllers have to go in and be perfect every single day.

And they know, based on what is in the current bill, that January 30th will loom around the corner.

Being made whole and being able to be back...

Being made whole and being able to be back up is knowing that every shutdown that you could possibly be the political pawn never puts controllers completely at ease.

But getting them paid is the priority so they can live their lives and ensure that they have the proper compensation.

It's the right step in the right direction.

Whatever it takes to open this government and pay our members is what's needed right now.

And we'll have to continue dealing with the fallouts and what the added stress and pressure that this has caused.

Go ahead.

I haven't seen the data specifically.

But I can tell you.

Every day that this shutdown, it goes on.

That an air traffic controller had to survive 41 days with financial insecurity.

That leads to added stress, frustration, pressures where air traffic controllers cannot be 100% focused on their job.

They're not a political pawn.

They shouldn't be used as a rope in this game.

And they know it.

They feel it.

And absolutely, every day that this drags on, that we have to worry about the stress and the pressure on them.

For a workforce that has to go in and be 100%, 100%.

100% of the time, there is no world where it just operates the same and smoothly when people aren't receiving pay.

So it's something that concerns us.

It's something we've been speaking about.

And it's something that's been real since day one of this shutdown.

Absolutely.

Secretary Duffy and Administrator Bedford will have to review.

Remember, also the cargo planes are grounded because of the UPS crash.

Are they getting the results they see?

Air traffic controllers show up to do our job day in and day out.

One plane or every plane in the sky, we're going to do everything we can.

We're going to do everything we can to ensure the safety of the American flying public.

And the administration will have to determine what that looks like.

But I can say that we have made it very clear that every day that this shutdown was to go,

that's going to be an increased risk in the system.

When there's increased risk in the system, there's only one way.

There's two ways you can handle it.

One is open the government plane to air traffic controllers and aviation safety professionals.

And you've got the groundings of those, so it just puts more stress on the supply chain.

Two is you have to look at the capacity of the airspace and how many flights that air traffic is in.

How many flights that air traffic controllers are handling every single day.

We absolutely do not condone any or support any level of an organized action.

There are no organized actions going on.

If there are issues in the system that are resulting from the shutdown,

they have to be determined and addressed by the FAA every single time that something like this goes on.

What our members are facing are issues, right?

We use the term call in sick so loosely with the federal workforce

that are the accepted employees that have to show up.

They're facing real issues.

We have letter after letter talking about the impacts this shutdown that it's having on them.

That they can't pay for gas to get to work.

That we have trainees that have moved hundreds if not thousands of miles across the country

to the highest cost of areas of living and now can't even afford to go to work

or they can't afford the childcare to come into work.

That is real and it's not something that can be looked at

or it's not something that can be diagnosed

because it's going to be moving around the country.

Different people, different shifts, different issues in their life every single time.

And speaking about that, I did want to give Amy a chance to speak about just those pressures right there.

All right, we'll hear one more thing and then we'll move.

She comes from a dual, you know, both her and her husband work for the FAA and what that's kind of caused.

Are you still in PINS calls? Yeah, they're up 90%.

My husband and I are air traffic controllers now having this two paychecks

that uncertainty and that financial strain is becoming unbearable.

It's now a dinnertime conversation with my kids on prioritizing bills.

Yesterday, my kids asked me how long we could stay in our house.

Having to answer that question was heartbreaking.

I'm going to be honest with you. I feel like they didn't say that.

That stress, that uncertainty, that fear is being felt among thousands of air traffic controllers, families across the nation.

Amy, can I just ask you while you're still here, can you speak a little bit more about the personal

stress and what this is doing to you and to your family?

You mentioned a little bit there, but just every single day when you work,

with this hanging over you, what have you had to juggle?

Oh wow, VCIG's up 55%. Fuck that stock.

Or putting gas in the car or diapers. Can you talk a little bit about that?

Absolutely. So we work in an environment that requires that 100% focus and presence.

And then having to have those conversations at home with your family, with your kids, explaining that,

hey, Christmas might look a little bit different this year. Right?

That's difficult on the family. That adds a stress that we've never had to deal with in the past.

That's fair, but the other part I don't believe.

So when you walk into an operation and you know your co-workers have taken a second job,

they're up till midnight driving Uber because they can't pay their bills.

Everyone's questioning if they can pay their mortgage.

I have co-workers who cannot pay for childcare.

So now they have to figure out how they're going to come into work.

That uncertainty, that fear.

Hey mom, is your IRA going to be funded this year?

I know air traffic controllers should have to carry when we're ensuring the safety of the flying public.

But that being said, we are 100% committed to our jobs.

Every flight that we handle is our number one priority and the safety of that flight.

We just want to do the work that we love, continue serving the flying public,

but not have to question how we're going to pay bills and make ends meet.

Did I miss somebody back here? Go ahead. I'll come right over here next.

What's the point of this press conference?

It just gives an insight into what the air traffic controllers are,

our thinking, and gives us an idea.

Because holiday spending, holiday flights, supply chains,

I think we've seen a shutdown go longer than any time in history.

It's very, very big on this.

And every single day it's presenting a new challenge.

You can't predict what the issues are because, again,

if the shutdown is to end tomorrow, controllers still haven't been paid yet.

They're still facing those issues.

While the rest of America will get to go on and that will no longer be the headline,

or the news headline, it's still real for them.

So we're going to have to continue working through the issues.

And our focus is it's not ended.

Even though that there is a new light at the end of the tunnel, we'll call it that,

every single day an air traffic controller is still facing the issues that they had yesterday,

and they're getting worse every single day.

So we will continue to work with the administration.

We'll continue to fight for it.

And we'll continue showing up to work to ensure the safety of the American flying public.

And we will do everything to get it back fully on track.

But it should show that a government shutdown is not sustainable,

and in no way should air traffic controllers ever be used as a political pawn in the process.

Just so everyone knows, before the shutdown, air traffic controllers got sick.

During the shutdown, air traffic controllers get sick.

After the shutdown ends, air traffic controllers will get sick.

And DCA is an extremely low staff facility.

Every day that they show up, they are already starting well below what they should.

So one to two persons being gone, whether that they had to take medication for Benadryl,

for the allergy season that's going on, they can't work that day.

They have a stringent requirement to show up to work fit and ready for duty.

That could be the added stresses and pressures of it.

Every person is dealing with a different level of financial stability or instability.

So some of those issues may be real.

But again, it just goes to show how fragile this system is.

And putting this additional stress and pressure on it,

we're going to see that level of issues that we have to contend with.

Yeah, I'm going to, by all means, here in just a moment.

Why do I always call it sick?

I don't always call it sick.

Alright, we're going to move off of this for now.

This country is short staffed right now.

We're 3,800 certified professionals.

Yeah, so this was my, so we took, when we saw that Eli Lilly insider buying,

we took calls and then sold them for like,

I think we got in for an average of 700 a piece and sold for 9 and 1100.

And today they're 13,260 a piece.

So that kind of sucks.

But yeah.

No, so a lot of the things that we got,

so some of the things that we got, our Monday shares from this morning are still doing good.

So a couple of the things that we got from what's happening this weekend.

Let me find my,

my pens.

I got to put them in a different drawer.

Does this one work?

Okay, this one works.

So a couple of things that we got from this weekend with this whole shutdown, right?

One of the ones that was a big one was the snap payments.

Okay.

So nice panties.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

You duck walk around your house.

No, I have to dip my, put some pants on.

I've always worn this shit.

This is the same shit I've always worn.

You guys just never saw it.

Listen here, you little shit.

Focus before you black out.

All right.

Thank you.

Why do you have two black eyes?

I don't.

It's just the lighting.

I got to work on the light.

I'm working on the lighting.

Okay.

I got like extra lights this weekend.

Are you talking about this?

That's called being a dad.

Assholes.

You look like the dad from the Adams family.

Delaware's changed him.

Your kids are punching you.

Okay.

All right.

So we got one thing and that was snap benefits.

Okay.

That doesn't work either.

God damn it.

Have kids.

They said it'll be fun.

They said.

Okay.

So we got one thing and that was snap benefits.

Okay.

That doesn't work either.

God damn it.

It'll be fun.

They said.

All right.

So we got snap benefits.

All right.

So originally they said because of government funding, snap benefits were going to be canceled.

I'm stocky.

They say a camera can age you three to five years.

So like how many cameras do you have on now?

What the fuck you, man?

Can I, can I get through the fucking whiteboard, man?

It's like this shit from yesterday, man.

From the stream.

I got a sponsored segment with Coinbase to do so I'm going to, don't, don't get me too

blacked out today.

Look at this.

Y'all just rude.

You look like your profile picture, but with an elderly filter.

The fuck, man.

Why are y'all so hateful?

It's fucking dead on though.

All right, asshole.

All right.

So snap benefits, they were going to cancel snap benefits, right?

Trump administration said we are going to cancel snap benefits because we can't afford

it.

Although we could go up with money for other shit like military, whatever snap, I'm going

to cancel it.

Right?

And so a bunch of states came in and said, okay.

We will fill the gap, right?

Like we'll fill the gap.

Then a court came out and said, you can't do that.

Right?

So then it was going to be partial payments.

Okay.

Federal court comes out, says, Hey, listen, you can't, you can't, you can't stop this.

You have to pay this out.

And at least the partial payments and in some cases, full payments, right?

So government starts putting out payments.

So they do full payments in October.

Okay.

And do partial for some to full for some for November.

Well, something changed.

And that is that surprisingly, okay, surprisingly, uh, I think a lot of people, um, uh, don't

know this or people that do are, are, are really, really, um, really surprised by this,

but the Biden appointed justice.

Okay.

Um, can, uh, how do you say, I always say her name wrong.

Ketanji Brown-Jackson.

Ketanji Brown-Jackson who has, so some people don't know this, but Supreme court justices

have little regions.

And if there is an emergency injunction or an emergency, uh, thing that's in their area,

they can actually go and make a ruling outside of the Supreme court, like convening.

And she actually goes and upholds the Trump administration's appeal to stop this lower

court because it went from one federal court, went up to another one.

They refuse to hear it.

So it goes up.

She does an emergency, uh, addendment or whatever you want to call it, emergency judgment and

upholds the Trump administration's blocking of the lower court, forcing them to pay out

the snap benefits.

And if that wasn't bad enough, the U S D a United States department of agriculture has

now told all of the states to take back the money that was given for November.

And if they don't, they will lose out on federal funding.

It's because the lower court's rulings were not valid.

What the fuck?

It's a court.

You have an appeals process.

Why is it that people, why is it that when Democrats were in charge, they were saying,

Oh, well that's that.

Charlie day.

If he shot meth behind the Denny's dumpster, also I'm shitting while I type this.

It's so weird that, that, that when Democrats were in power and lower courts overturned

things or did things, and then it was overturned again, they're like, Oh, it was invalid.

And then Republicans were like, that's fucking bad precedent.

That's such a bad precedent.

You can't just tell courts that they did.

They're invalid.

Then we lose the entire court system and the integrity of the court system.

Now it's the opposite shoe.

It's like, it's invalid.

Like shut the fuck up, man.

Either, either, either, either let it all be or don't be either way.

U S D a okay.

Has now said that if you don't get back that money, take the money back, you will not get

federal funding old as fuck looking, but look at them girly ass hands.

How do you know?

What are the dams?

Cause Jonesy has, has been here for a long time.

I'm not saying all Republicans, but I'm just saying like, he, he reminds me of people that

are like strict the line.

Same thing I saw with some of the people that are, that are like when, with the Democrat,

you know, that, that are in here that like hardcore, like leftist, even if Trump does

something that, that potentially could be positive, they're like, fuck, that guy's a

Nazi.

I'm like, okay, cool.

But, but, but I'm like, okay, but let's, let's, let's look at the facts of what's happening

here and not the, but yeah, this is something they're doing and they're threatening to pull

federal funding.

Massachusetts has come and said, we're still going to keep the money that we gave out and

we're going to sue you for trying to, to, to, to blackmail us with the funding.

But that guy's a Nazi.

See, the problem is, is that when you say that actual Nazis fucking love it because

they're like, hell yeah, we're mainstream now.

We're not as bad because if everybody, if we call everybody this word, then it just

dumbs down the word and it's not so bad anymore.

Remember that guys, um, it happens with any word.

Yeah.

There's a flavor in that.

It's like when people use the word racist too much, like if you call everything racist

and actual racist stuff doesn't, doesn't have the same negative, it's not like a shun anymore.

You know what I mean?

There was a time when like if you called somebody a racist and they were being racist, like

it was a big deal.

But when they started calling everything that it like dumbs down the word and then it's

like it loses its, its meaning and it doesn't have that like super negative connotation

that it once had.

Like.

And then it was labeled a racist and now it's like people like, you know, it's, it's, it's

a, it's a crazy thing.

It's a societal thing.

You know, it's like, it's like the government, right?

The government has started more conspiracy theories than people because the more conspiracy

theories are out there and the more people have conspiracy theories, the more it's like

when actual shit happens, it makes it seem like everything has a conspiracy theory.

Right.

It's funny.

how it works with, with, with, with language. Um, frankly, that's a bunch of bullshit. You,

you don't think the government has, has, has, has CIA or any, any of those has either started or

helped fester crazy conspiracy theories. They have, it's even been proven. The reason that I say that

is because here's the thing. When you can, when you can convince people or make something seem

kind of wild and out there, it conditions people. And not only does it condition people,

it makes everything seem the same, right? So if there's something the government,

let's say the government did or some shady organization did or some corporation did,

right? And there was a lot of eyes on it and there was people talking about it.

Well, then it brings up, people start paying attention like, oh, this might be real.

But if there is a million different conspiracy theories out there and some of them are outlandish,

then whenever you start hearing the same groups of people talk about,

are you like, oh, here they go again. Oh, here they go again. Oh, here they go again.

Very, it's very, it's not even, it's not even controversial. It's a very simple tactic.

Like I'm not, it isn't controversial. Like it's very smart to do those things.

Make up, make up fake things that, that, that, that happen. I'm talking about,

I'm not talking about the Nazi or the racist or, or the, or the snowflake or, or, or, or, you know,

fucking socialist or whatever scare tactic there is. But like, it's, it's very easy to do that.

It's like,

right? It's like debasing a currency. Um, I'm going off topic. Keep acting like Nazis aren't

around. I never said Nazis aren't around. And I just said, when you, you know what?

I'm not going to ban you, but that is such a bad faith fucking thing to do that. I know you're

purposely doing that. You're not that stupid. So I know it's rage bait and I'm going to shut up.

I'm going to let you go because I know that's rage bait. You're, there's no way you're that dumb

to take what I said and, and, and, and, and twist it.

To that. There's no way you could do that. There's just no way I've redistributed the

pedals socialist icon. Uh, I'm not going to get into it because that's social. That's a social

thing that I'm not going to get into. I think I made it very clear that, that, you know, when

you overuse a word that used to have a very, like very strong meaning, it loses its strength as a,

as a, as a word, especially when you're using it to describe somebody that's actually like

specifically that.

That way. And so if people can't understand that, then I think they're the same people who

will wonder why people don't stop bad people because they're just as bad. They're the reason

they caused it. You know what I mean? Like when, when you hear somebody do so, I'll give you an

example in the stock world, right? Insider trading or pumping dumps and shit like that.

There used to be very few of them, like compared to what they are now. And being accused of,

of insider trading or, or, or, or, or, or running a Ponzi scheme or a pump and dump scheme was a big

deal. People were very scared of it. But now we joke about pump and dumps, insider trading so much.

And then when you hear insider trading or you hear pump and dump, you're just like,

God damn it. They got away with it again. Or fuck, I guess it's just the new normal.

See what I mean? Like you condition enough. It's no longer that it's not no longer a scary word

like genocide, but you seemed okay with chat spamming it two months ago in chat with no

pushback from your side, stock guy, hypocrite. What are you even talking about? How is,

what does genocide have to do with this? I'm so confused right now. It's a Monday. I'm getting

off topic here, but let me see what he's talking about. Maybe I missed it. Play dumb, playing dumb

and not remembering what you obviously have stuck on. Is there, please stop the bullshit soccer.

Everyone knows you voted for Trump. Oh, oh, you are. Oh, you, you, you, oh, I'm glad I pulled this

up. Now I know that you're just, uh, you're, you're baiting. Okay. Okay. You admitted that

you just pulled the rage bait. All right. Thank you.

Thank you for writing that. That fucking saved me a fucking blackout right there.

All right, let's keep going. It's true. He did vote for Trump. Actually, I didn't vote for

president. Um, this is the second, this was the second, uh, election in a row. I, I, I left the

president one blank. I didn't even do a write-in. I focused more on the, um, local elections

and I'm okay with that. Phoenix rising zero one, just resubbed for three months.

Fence sitter. No, not a fence sitter. I just didn't, I just didn't want to vote for either

of you.

Everybody, everybody, I need y'all to stop right now. I just want you to know I voted

for Trump and you goddamn blue haired fucking liberal snowflakes. Every goddamn one of y'all

going to Trump meeting with the Syrian president. Y'all get deported. All right, fuck y'all.

Oh, it's crazy. The comments of mine you read versus what you don't read, but it's, I do

find it funny that you think if people weren't mean or just talk to people in a better way

that they'd make better decisions. Is that bait too? Cause that is not what I said. I

think you're, you're, you're taking what I said. I think you're taking what I said. I'm

taking what I said. I think you're, you're, you're taking what I said. I think you're, you're

You're taking what I said and you're making your own reality and adding it to something else.

All I said was is that in language, in pure language, if you take something that is very specific and you start using that word on other things that could be adjacent to it and then adjacent to it and adjacent to it, people no longer, you know, take, you know, hear that word and automatically compute it.

Or automatically understand it as the original thing.

It could be about anything.

The more separation of degree we use on a word, okay, I'll give you an example.

Pizza, right?

Let's say the first pizza was just cooked dough with tomato sauce on it, okay?

Then they added cheese.

Then they added pepperoni.

Mushroom.

Green olives.

Black olives.

Say this.

Then they started putting fucking pineapple on that shit, okay?

That's a bastardization of pizza.

Sure.

You still call it a pizza.

But people who are like, that's not the pizza, right?

Next thing you know, you got a fucking cookie pizza.

You got a fruit pizza.

It's still a pizza, but it's not the original thing.

But people just get used to the idea that anything made in a circle and cooked is a pizza, right?

That's what I was getting at.

You're getting hooked up on this specific word I was talking about.

I'm just saying if you do that, then the people who are actually those shitty people, right?

Like, for example, if I make a sex joke, you're going to call me a pervert, right?

But long ago, when you heard pervert, that meant someone who actually did some devious shit,

like staring in people's windows and watching them get naked at night.

That's what you thought.

Now you hear the word pervert, you just think, oh, he's being perverted.

Oh, he's just being immature.

You see what I mean?

That's the same kind of thing.

I hear pervert, I think of the stock guy.

Personally, I didn't like either candidate either, but I don't believe in the don't vote mindset.

I mean,

it just doesn't do anything or have any impact.

I think the better option is to vote for the lesser of two evils and go with whatever candidate

you think is better than if they suck.

And you know what?

That's the cool thing about voting.

It's your choice.

It's your vote.

And you can do with it what you want.

And I don't think anyone should ever be pressured into doing something that they don't want to do.

Other people can tell you, hey, you need to do this or do this with something that is yours

and yours alone.

And I feel like we do that too much.

And I'm not afraid to say that I left that space blank.

Now, I very, very, very closely followed the amendments in my state and my city council,

my mayor, my state electives, and even my representatives in Senate.

There were choices where I was like, okay, I would prefer this person over that person.

But I'm never, there's no way anyone is ever going to bully me or convince me that

I did something wrong with what was mine and mine alone.

Whether I choose to do it, you know,

you know, I'm not going to do it.

I'm not going to use it or not use it.

That's up to me.

That's how I always look at it.

Haters will say fence sitter, but this is the right mentality.

Again, I'm just a very open person.

I'm willing to admit these things because I'm not worried about what other people think

about me for that.

And I usually don't talk personal politics, but I think that we got off on a little tangent

here.

And I think people are very, it's showing very much in chat that people are very, very

conditioned to believe something.

And if they hear something that is outside of this is exactly right, or this is exactly,

exactly wrong, it messes with them.

And I'm not hating on them.

I'm just wanting to be that one person out there who's like, this is what I think for

these reasons.

This is what I do for these reasons.

And it's not because what I was told to do or what I was told is right or wrong.

You know what I mean?

Like these, I like to have very difficult conversations.

I do.

Even if we disagree, I like to have them because I feel like we've lost the ability to have

conversations because it's all team sport.

Now you're either with me or against me.

You either say what you say.

And if you don't say what I agree with, then you're at a blank, a blank.

I don't like that.

And there's only one way to fix it.

And that's to talk.

It doesn't mean we're going to change our minds, but we still have to talk.

Oak Pizza Hut 420 has gifted us up to Ramabamajam.

CXW still going.

We got out of Kodak.

That was nice.

Monday's still going.

Our shares are popping right now.

We're up about 10 bucks a share right now.

I didn't sign up for marriage counseling.

Gay used to mean happy.

Now look where we are.

I think that's that's full.

We're totally changing the way of a word.

People don't like it.

People don't like it.

And it's nothing to do with partisan politics.

You know, like it's it's it's like the idea of a social justice warrior.

Right.

Like an SJW.

Like there was a meaning for that.

And then it just became anybody who advocated for rights.

You see what I mean?

Like the more you you utilize a word that is is supposed to be a negative

connotation for a very specific group of people.

And then you do it.

It loses its meaning.

And then now, you know, it becomes a joke.

It becomes a word.

You know, that's what I'm saying is, is that I noticed that I recognize that.

And it takes things away from what really are.

That's all.

All right.

Can you give marriage counseling?

Your wife is hot.

We want that as well.

I mean, my wife's OK.

I mean, find somebody who needs papers.

I don't know.

Oh, my God.

Don't do that.

Actually, she almost broke up with me.

She didn't need the papers.

Damn spy line hit, didn't it?

Trump is with the Syrian.

What's he going to do?

He's going to go off the rails.

Hopefully stop losses start.

I'm kicking in.

You really should be careful talking about sensitive subjects.

You'll start losing followers.

If people want to unfollow me because I have a different opinion than them or I see things

differently than them, then that's on them and not me.

I can't make everybody happy.

Did Saki finish talking about snap from an hour ago?

I think I already did.

I want to break down the 50 year mortgage and how stupid that is.

But I'm going to have to wait a little bit.

Hector just resubbed for 11 months.

All right.

Oh, by the way, I opened up Twitch today and this was the Twitch advertisement.

It was a front page.

Carousel had somebody with a fucking stealth bomber and a jet.

And then the ad behind it was Marines 250 years.

Fortune Gen Z expects to inherit money and assets, but their boomer parents aren't planning

on leaving anything behind.

That's because they're using it all for for reverse mortgages because of Tom Selleck.

And they're they're they're they're they're using it to fund their their retirement homes

because they.

Got really nice ass retirement homes right now.

Is it OK for me to assume that most American citizens watching this government shutdown

it hurting a lot of people or most people don't care?

We're in a we've we've always been and more so nowadays where as long as it's not me,

it's OK.

And I feel like we're all guilty of that.

I'll give you an example.

How many times do you look to see what your net worth or your salary is in percentile?

How many times have you done that?

Has everybody done that before?

Where you look to see what percentile?

I'm in.

We do that, right?

Like what percentile?

You've never done that.

OK, maybe I'm alone.

But there's times where we've looked at our salary or we see a headline that says this

is the top 10 percent, 1 percent.

And you go into it and you type in what's my, you know, percentile.

So income percentile calculator.

So obviously it depends on where you live.

But for example, if you make.

Um.

A hundred thousand dollars a year, you work 40 hours a week, right?

You are in the 71 percentile.

So you're in the top 29 percent.

OK, comparison is a thief of joy.

Why would you do that to yourself?

I'm making a point, dipshit.

I'm not saying that everyone should do this.

I'm just saying this shows you where you're at, right?

So it gives you an idea, right?

So if you make two hundred fifty thousand a year, OK, you're in the top five percent.

Now, some people will look at this because in their brain they look and say, OK, that

means I can afford more than ninety five percent of other people, which means that I am doing

OK, which means I'm, you know, you know, how am I going to, you know, buy something?

Or if you compare it to the average, you know, you know, or the median income of America

of fifty thousand or whatever it is nowadays, you say, OK, well, I make five times what

the median is.

So depending on where I live, I can afford five times as much or I can say five times.

But.

It's just something that people will do.

Right.

And it's something that it's something that we what was I talking about?

Why did I get in on this again?

Oh, yeah.

About why why people are doing this.

So when you hear that 40 million Americans are going to miss their SNAP benefits, if

somebody isn't affected by that for the vast majority, it does.

They don't wake up thinking about it and they don't go to bed thinking about it.

They may empathize with people or they may say.

I hope I don't get to that point or whatever, but they'll just kind of be like, all right,

that sucks.

I hate to see it.

I hope those people get their stuff and move on with their life.

So the average American.

OK, because 40 million accounts for children, too.

So if you take 330 million Americans, right, it's about 12 percent, 13 percent of the population.

So it means about nine out of 10 people aren't affected.

And it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't affect them.

But we're also in that way in the world where if it doesn't affect us, we don't take action.

And the reason is, is because as long as I have mine, as long as I taken care of.

Right.

It's like it's like, you know, I care about these people, but I care more about me and

my family and what we do.

And we got to focus on that.

Right.

Some people will say, ah, sucks for them or good riddance, fucking drain on society, whatever

people will have all their way.

But we don't do that.

And it comes down to that old saying where it says, you know, I cry.

I'm sorry.

They came for these people.

I said nothing.

They came for these people.

I said nothing.

They came for these people.

I said nothing.

They came for me.

There was no one to speak for me and to speak for me.

Right.

And it's the same mentality we have.

We're all locked into what we have and how we're doing.

And it's not that we're bad people.

It doesn't mean we're bad people.

We got a lot of shit going on.

I'm over here fucking doing budgeting, trying to fix out our budget because of what's going

on with me, my health, the dog's health, the move.

You know, I'm having to do that, too.

And it doesn't mean that I don't care about people that that aren't doing as well.

And I'm not, you know, comparing myself.

But we're so focused because we have.

There's so much going on.

And so the average American will will not care enough to take action.

And it doesn't mean they're bad people.

Right.

We can't.

You can't.

You can't look at somebody focusing on them and their family and say, you're the problem.

You should be doing more.

Yes, we should.

But you also have to understand that because it doesn't affect them directly, they're not

going to take action.

Now, there's a good argument to be had.

Yeah, it's not affecting you yet.

But there's this.

The idea for most people is as long as I stay above this level, even if things get worse

for these people, as long as I'm going up, right, like think about inflation and wages,

right?

As long as my wages are going up more than inflation, I'm OK.

But how many people are getting buried underneath that?

Right.

It's like empathy.

No, no empathy.

It's not a lack of empathy.

You can empathize with somebody and still not take an action.

I can empathize with somebody going through a very bad, you know, health problem or empathize

with somebody who lost their parents.

But it doesn't mean that I'm going to go like.

Be their parent or like, like go to their parents funeral or something like that.

You know, like empathizing is not you can empathize, but taking action is different.

There's something wrong by Mike.

You think people don't care now?

Wait until GTA six drops facts.

I can't afford monetary time wise to care for every poor or homeless person, and neither

does some cases do.

Yeah, this isn't about this isn't about.

Oh, it's a YouTube video.

OK, this isn't about, you know, comparison.

And it's true.

Comparison is the thief of joy.

Whether you compare yourself to somebody else.

Whether you compare yourself to somebody who has more or compare yourself to somebody

who has less.

You are going to mess yourself up.

But, you know, the flip side of that is, is that you're so focused on you and yours, right?

I was walking with my kids the other night, Friday night.

We took a family walk and my dog wanted to be next to me.

And my son wanted to say, Daddy, hold my hand.

My daughter said, hold my hand.

And I'm sitting there walking down the street and I've got my dog like trying to get between

my legs and my son and my daughter.

And I'm walking with them.

And I'm thinking to myself.

You know, I told my wife, I said, you know, I, you know what I came from.

You know, I had nothing.

You know, the abuse, the neglect, the children's home, the addictions, the whole nine yards.

Like I had nothing.

I come from nothing.

I came from absolutely nothing.

My family, it was nothing.

My family was a dredge on society.

They took so much from society.

They were whatever.

And I said to myself, I said, you know, she said, you broke the cycle.

I said, no, no, no.

I started a new cycle.

And I'm focusing on making sure that those kids are taken care of.

That my kids have what I didn't have.

And I don't mean by things.

I mean by.

A safe place to live.

Not being sick.

Going to the doctor when you're sick.

Going to a school.

Having things to engage with.

Having family and parents that talk to them and play with them.

And I'm so focused on that.

That I can't, or at least I don't, focus on all the other things.

And it's not that I'm bad or I'm indifferent or apathetic.

It's that I'm so hyper-focused on that.

And so when you hear what's going on, people will talk about it online.

People will organize.

People will do things.

But you're not going to be able to get the average American to stand up and say,

okay, that's enough.

I'm not voting.

Right?

Or what they say online, they don't put into action.

And we want to shame those people.

And most of the people shaming those people are doing the same thing.

They just feel a moral superiority by going online and telling us that those people aren't doing enough.

So you're selfish.

If you consider that selfish, then I understand.

I'm not going to argue with you on that.

That's a very valid argument.

That's a valid take.

I disagree, but it's a valid take.

Stocky, you're spending too much time caring about your children and your family and your in-laws and your parents

and not enough time caring about other families.

It's a fair take.

I disagree, but it's fair.

I could be doing more.

You're right.

I could be doing more.

I could be doing more just by using my platform to advocate more.

But the question was, is does the average American not care?

I think they care.

They just don't.

They just don't have the ability.

They just don't have the ability in their minds to do something.

Because they think to themselves, either one, I have more to focus on, or two, I can't do much.

I'm just one person.

Okay?

Selfish unk.

Let's be less selfish with the signals.

Can you get a Monday YOLO?

We already took Monday for a YOLO.

And it's doing very well.

We're up almost $10 on shares.

CXW was great.

We got out of that.

I'm playing NIVF again.

Again, I'm just going to be straight with you when I talk.

I mean, you're not going to agree with everything I say.

And that's totally fine.

I don't expect you to.

But, you know, I want you to understand at least where I'm coming from.

And, you know, it's not an easy conversation to have.

It never has been.

Your auto-mod is weird?

What did you say that got auto-modded?

What the fuck, you DJs?

Okay, that shouldn't be auto-modded.

I was introduced to you six years ago.

I missed your streams, brother.

I've learned more since I've been following you than in college, not going to lie.

Hmm.

Okay.

All right, there we go.

I fixed it.

I'm not sure what's going on with auto-mod.

God damn, we're up big today.

Palantir, 7%.

Google, almost 3%.

SoFi, 6%.

Joby, 4%.

Microsoft, 1%.

NVX, 9%.

Rivian, 1.5%.

Celsius, 7%.

About time to add to Aerie again.

I'm getting tired of waiting.

I've been playing them between like 3.20 or 3.10 and 3.60 or 3.50.

I don't know what's going on with auto-mod.

AI has had enough.

I've had enough of Stoppy's BS.

Oh, shit.

There's the sell-off.

Those stop-losses have been triggering.

Plug might be in play here.

Plug had some good news this morning.

Do you still own Fubo?

I think so, somewhere.

I sold most of it when we hit 300% on it.

Yeah, Plug's going to be getting about $275 million from some asset sales.

Monday's still going.

I didn't get those calls because it was just too expensive, but that's okay.

The shares are doing well.

The calls are okay.

50%, by the way.

The January 170 calls.

We thought this morning that this would be a bit of an oversell

based on the fact that they lowered their guidance by only like $20 million

on like $10 billion revenue or some shit.

Or, sorry, $2 million off of a $300 million revenue or whatever.

So we felt like it was a bit of an oversell.

That's why we jumped into it at $151.

I wanted to take calls if it was under $152 or $151 and open,

and I tried getting into the spread.

It was too much, and I just didn't chase it.

All right, let's do marbles real quick while we're waiting on Trump.

If he's not live by the time we come back,

I'm going to whiteboard the 50-year mortgage

and why this is going to be absolutely one of the fucking insane.

I'll talk about it when we get back.

This is just wild.

The fact that there's even people that are applauding this scares me.

Okay?

All right, let's do marbles real quick, and then we'll do it.

Okay?

Yo, Huxton, I didn't realize you won.

Let's just make it till day.

Actually, like the name implies, fuck it.

What?

Make it till day?

What does that mean?

All right, get in, you DJs.

Let's go.

Also, Daniela, I added your—

It's not a furry emote.

Your squirrel booty dance emote for T3,

so we'll see how that works out.

I'm sure everybody's going to use it as like a furry thing.

It's not a furry.

That's not a sexual thing.

It's not a squirrel presenting itself.

It was based off—

It was based off of that video we watched.

Okay, that makes it sound bad, but you know what I mean.

I just realized it does look like it's in heat, and now I'm really—

Okay.

Nightbot.

Nightbot hates stew.

I love it.

Oh, Nightbot time him out, too.

What's going on with the Nightbot?

I mean, I'm actually happy about it right now, but—

Yo, since they're playing—

You know what?

Never mind.

Let's go.

Who's the dude in the bottom pick?

That's me when I was 22,

and I was a—

Model, actor, whatever you want to call it.

That was one of the photos.

Oh, this mashup pissed some people off?

That means I did my job.

Where's the shower picture?

Oh, you want my shower picture now?

Damn, I fell off?

Yeah, you and me both.

How'd you go from hot model to—

What?

How'd you go to hot model to relapsed Hunter Biden?

What the fuck does that even mean?

Capture.

Are they going to extend the ACA,

or should we get out of health insurance?

Um, the crazy thing about the bill

is that they're only promising to do a vote on it

in the second week of December.

They're not promising anything.

The reason that healthcare stocks are falling so much—

The reason that the healthcare stocks are falling so much

is because Trump actually announced

with the $2,000 tariff dividend

that he's going to give out to non-wealth,

high-income people,

that they're going to start—

using the federal funds to pay people's bills directly

instead of through the health insurance and healthcare companies.

And they're falling on that.

I don't think he's going to follow through with that

because the pharmaceutical and healthcare companies lobby

is way too much.

And so I don't think he's going to follow through with that.

I mean, you know, you never know.

But so I don't think—

Plus, I don't think people realize

that as much as we hate insurance,

if the insurance wasn't there,

you know, how is competition going to work

and where's quality?

I don't know.

I mean, insurance is kind of fucked

because with the way Medicare, Medicaid,

and other health insurance works,

you can get privatized things done for cheaper

than you can through insurance

because insurance premiums are just so high

and you're covering other people.

So for individual people that don't have health conditions,

it would be a better deal for them.

But people that have serious things to get done

or people that have pre-existing conditions

are going to be hurting a lot for it.

So, you know, it's one of those things where,

again, it's like—

It's like,

when the Affordable Care Act came out.

People that didn't buy into the exchange

and wanted to have private insurance

were going to have to pay more

to subsidize the people that bought into the exchange.

But people that needed the help

were able to get more help

and get coverage

and be able to afford it.

So it actually helped the economy more

in a lot of ways.

But people that don't need something

and that are forced to lose something because of it

like it when they get to save their money.

Again, it comes into that,

you know, as long as it's not me mentality.

And that is just,

that is just the way it goes.

It's not,

it's not anecdotally maybe not,

but as a whole,

that's how people are.

You know,

it sucks other people are hurting,

but as long as,

you know,

but I don't want to pay for it

or I don't want to subsidize for it

or I don't want to lose something for it.

Would we be better off

if health insurance didn't exist?

I disagree.

I think we'd be better off if it was fixed.

We got rid of PBMs.

We had some kind of oversight and control

and we had more competition.

But getting rid of health insurance

sounds great

if you're somebody who doesn't need health insurance.

You understand what I mean?

Like if you don't have a pre-existing condition

or you're like young and a good health

and stuff like that,

sure, yeah, get rid of health insurance.

Sounds great.

Why?

Because you don't have to pay as much.

You'll probably get better deals

in a more competitive marketplace, right?

There's a competitive marketplace.

They don't get these fat checks.

They're having to do better work for cheaper money

because that's a competitive marketplace.

That's good.

That's good.

If you can afford it.

But people who can't afford that

now don't have an option

via a subsidized health insurance plan

and they're even more,

and they're even more hurting

and they put more,

then how are they going to get help?

They're going to have to find

some other government subsidy

that you're going to have to pay for

via tax dollars somewhere else.

So it's a monkey paw curl kind of situation.

I don't know what's going on with Nightbot, guys.

Do Americans understand that you pay twice as much

as the rest of the world for health care?

Oh, absolutely.

I just said that our health insurance

and our health care situation

is absolutely fucking broken.

But a lot of that comes with

because of shady things like PBMs

red tape and government,

you know,

the way the government works, right?

Like I told you about the VA.

The VA is a mess.

The VA is a mess.

Okay?

It's an absolute fucking mess.

And the reason it's a mess

is because nobody wants to fix it

because it would be political suicide.

If you go in and say,

hey, we're giving 10 times as much money,

but the care and everything else

is 10 times worse.

What's the problem?

Oh, we're just throwing money at it

and it's being wasted here

or it's not being fixed here.

It's not doing here.

Let's fix some of that.

Let's do that.

Let's do that.

If one veteran

misses a payment,

one veteran gets sick,

one veteran dies during that,

you will be politically

fucking destroyed.

So what do they do instead?

Fuck, just keep throwing

more money at it.

So how is it that you add

more money to something

and the quality gets worse?

Because no one wants to fix it.

It's the same thing

with almost any government

subsidy program.

People will say,

Staki, you're just being

a libertarian

or you're being a fucking,

you know,

a right winger when you say that.

No, that's true.

How we go about fixing it

is up for debate.

But there is no debate

that government programs

are run horribly.

People say they're underfunded.

No.

A lot of them are not underfunded.

A lot of them are mismanaged.

But nobody wants to say that.

Okay?

I'm not even talking

about cutting funding.

I'm saying people will say

they're underfunded.

A lot of times,

they're overfunded.

They're just mismanaged.

So the results are terrible.

Okay?

Nobody wants to say that.

This is the quiet part out loud

that everyone is afraid to say.

And people on the right

want to say that

government-funded agencies, right?

These are the two biggest talking points.

On the left, underfunded.

On the right, overfunded.

There it is.

Easy to say.

That's great talking points.

That's great for elections.

That's great for campaigns.

The truth is,

is both of these are wrong.

And both of them are right.

The truth, though, is

it's mismanaged.

It's mismanaged.

A lot of these agencies

are just mismanaged.

And we keep,

throwing more and more money at them,

and the quality keeps getting worse

and worse and worse.

And we look for anecdotal reasons

why it's bad.

Oh, it's this or it's that.

It's mismanaged.

Nobody wants to go in and fix it.

Because they're worried that it's,

because once you give something,

you can't take it away.

Any type of subsidy.

Once the government starts subsidizing

or starts giving credits

or starts funding something,

they can never take money away from it

without a huge outcry

and a huge block of voters

that will vote against them.

Because a vast majority of Americans

are single-issue voters.

They're single-issue voters.

Right?

There's people on the left

that vote only for the candidate

that promises to legalize drugs.

Or people on the right

that vote for the candidate,

only the candidate that voted

to protect gun rights.

Or people on the left

that vote for the candidate

that's gonna bring legislation

for gun control.

Right?

Or people on the right

that will vote for somebody

only because they say

they're a Christian.

It doesn't matter.

Abortion.

Right?

It doesn't matter.

There's so many Americans

that are single-issue voters.

So when you go to take funding away

or fix it,

if you,

if you fuck it up

or one person,

you know,

loses money

or anything happens,

there's gonna be an outcry

and you can lose

a big block of voters.

Okay?

And so,

this money is mismanaged.

Why is it mismanaged?

Because these are large agencies

that continue to grow

and grow and grow.

So you either have to

add more people working there

and nobody wants to add

more government employees,

or you have to go in

and find out

and audit it

and figure out where it is,

which takes time and money

and nobody wants to deal

with that bullshit.

And if you do find

that money is being mismanaged

and you start drying up

that money

or taking that money away,

if somebody gets hurt

during that

or somebody isn't

taken care of,

then it's gonna be

you are the one

who voted that

and then that's the reason

that person died,

got sick,

or was hungry.

So what do we do?

We just keep throwing

more money at it.

We figure,

if we throw,

for every hundred billion dollars

we throw,

if ten billion of it

actually goes to working,

then we did a good job.

Right?

A little bit better.

A little bit better.

And then we can do a headline.

Oh, we put more money

and that's gonna be for this.

It's heavily mismanaged.

It's heavily mismanaged.

Isn't the Office of Inspector General

technically responsible?

How can you...

Four trillion dollars a year

to like six hundred agencies.

Who's gonna go through

and do that?

This is about mismanagement.

The VA, for example.

I go to the VA.

The VA is heavily mismanaged.

The VA gets a shitload of money.

And yet,

it is horrible.

Not just for the veterans,

for the workers there.

I went through seven doctors

seven times.

Since COVID.

Because they kept quitting.

Because they were overworked

and underpaid.

They would go private sector.

Or move to a

VA hospital

somewhere more remote

that opened up

so they had less of a caseload.

I'm unpopular for saying this,

but I don't give a shit.

Two percent

of our budget

goes to

veteran

disability

payments.

And I can tell you this right now.

I don't give a shit

what anybody says.

There are a lot of veterans

that are taking advantage

of that system

that are getting payments

that don't...

don't deserve them.

I'll get hate for that

because you'll be like,

how dare you say that?

This person signed up

to go to war for this country

to protect this country.

They deserve every penny they get.

No.

It's not true.

That is not true.

There are people at the VA

that will tell you,

I'm an advocate.

I can get you 100%.

I have been told this many times.

I'm not blaming the veterans.

I'm blaming the system.

They have patient advocates,

veteran advocates

that will...

that get commissioned too,

by the way,

that will tell you,

I can get you 100%.

Did you ever see combat?

No.

I can still get you 100%.

You think I'm picking on veterans.

No, I'm a veteran.

I have been offered 100...

No, 100 times.

Five or six times.

Hey, I can get you 100%.

You saw combat.

Okay.

You deal with this.

You were in burn pits

and stuff like that.

We can talk about this

and this and this

and I can get you 100%.

And I decline it.

I decline it.

There's just no way.

I would feel comfortable with that.

But I know veterans.

I went to...

I was in an intake program

for four months

at the military.

I was in an intake program

at the Miami VA.

I met dozens,

if not a hundred veterans.

And a lot of them

never got deployed

and they were on 100%

total and permanent.

And they were working jobs

on the side.

It's not the veterans.

It's the mismanagement.

So what do they do?

Well, you can't deny benefits

for somebody

because if they go online,

if they start a group,

if they're...

Whatever.

Then next thing you know,

the government is not

taking care of its veterans.

It's not providing.

They deserve it.

Hoorah.

Because the right,

especially Republicans,

spent hundreds of millions

if not billions of dollars,

actually tens of billions

of dollars

all after 2003 in Iraq

paying for advertisement

and to keep the,

you know,

support our troops

the whole nine yards.

And I'm not...

I'm not shitting on vets, right?

But they spent that money

because guess what?

That is...

That was a good way

of getting...

Keeping the war going

and doing the Patriot Act

and the NDAA

and all that stuff like that.

But here's the problem.

They now can't go back

and not pay out veterans.

Because if you deny somebody

who could pay out veterans,

let's say there's...

Let's say there's a hundred guys

who apply for 100%.

And five of them deserve it.

And if you block 95 of them

that don't deserve it

and then five of them who do

don't get the money,

guess what?

This is a headline.

And then that gets...

Picks up steam.

And now you don't care

about veterans and veterans.

And your Republicans,

especially their voter base,

is not going to be happy

with them denying

combat veterans

what they're due.

I'm just using this

as one example.

I'm not going after the VA.

But that's one example

of mismanagement.

Just pay everybody.

Just pay everybody

because we can't deal with it.

We can't go through

and fix this out

just if they have this,

qualify for it,

do whatever they...

Here's another one.

And this is a tough one

because how do you deal with this?

They now say that

if you were a woman

and you were in the service

and you say that you were assaulted,

they will give you a pension.

Now, there's no way of proving it

because obviously

unless it was on video

or you had something

taken care of in the military

at the time and you didn't

because as a woman

you're afraid of repercussions

and ostracization, right?

A lot of women went through

some really fucked up shit.

But they don't do that.

So, what does that mean?

There will be people

that take advantage of that.

And I'm not taking anything away

from the people who deserve it.

But that's another one, right?

And so, it's one of those things

where you add layers of this

but take the VA out of it

and add it to any other agency.

Now, with the VA,

they have this all the time.

In Miami, think about it.

In Miami and Southern California,

places like that,

where do people...

22% of...

I think 25 or maybe 20...

Maybe it's one third now.

Yeah.

Homeless people in America

are veterans.

And where do homeless people go?

Where the weather's better.

So, of course,

those facilities,

those VA hospitals

are way overrun.

So, what do you do?

You have to build more facilities.

But instead,

they just put more money

into the single facility.

And then once they put

the money out there,

they lose track of it.

They get an audit

at the end of the year

and they just have to say,

trust me, bro.

Okay?

And the other thing is

is that the VA is at a point

where it's so backlogged

that if you have an immediate

thing to be done

and they can't see you,

you can go outside the VA.

You have to go through this.

I had to get MRIs

on both my hands

and both my feet

because my condition's worsening.

Right?

They couldn't see me.

The next available MRI

for one of my hands,

okay,

was four months.

Both my feet

was five months

and my other fan

was six months out.

It was going to take

six months for me

to get four quick MRIs.

So, what did that mean?

That means that the...

Guess what happened?

The VA had to offer me

the alternative

to go out...

into community care.

I sent out the community care

and guess what?

This now costs the VA

four times more

because now

I have to go to a private thing

who are then going to bill the VA

for way more money.

So, it just costs even more money.

So, the amount of money

that they are spending

to take care of people

but they're so overloaded

is way more than they would

if they just managed the money better.

If they built a bigger facility.

If they partnered

with another hospital.

If they did something.

But that's just...

This is just how this goes.

And nobody wants to tackle

the issue of mismanagement

at the veteran...

at the VA

because it's political suicide.

They don't

because they can't afford

to be the ones

that oversaw

a veteran dying

or getting sick

or not getting their benefits.

Now, take this

and add it to any other agency.

So, when I say,

yes, you're right.

Some agencies are underfunded

and some are overfunded.

But that's not the problem.

It's just like when I talk about

increasing revenue.

First, you have to get

your spending under control.

You want to increase revenue?

Guess where you're going to get it from.

The .01%.

But saying tax the rich

is such a bullshit thing.

That's not how you get your money.

The loopholes are already in place

for that to go away.

There's no income tax.

There's no flat tax, VAT tax.

You got to go for actionable things

like taxing

or getting revenue

from the loans

that they take off of their equities.

Or...

Eliminating the GRAT

or many other things.

Right?

Eliminating the loopholes

that allow for offshore billing

in shell companies

in tax havens.

Like, that's what you have to do.

But they never bring that up

because they know

that that's going to

fuck up their base.

Same thing here.

You have to go after

where the problem is.

But nobody wants to do that.

So, what do we do?

We just throw more money at it.

And we wonder why

we're in the situation we are.

The government red tape,

the government bureaucracy,

the government, no oversight,

just, this is all we do.

We just throw it.

And then you can't take it away.

I'm not going to bring up the cheese caves.

I know you guys are waiting for that.

This is a great talk,

but what is the motivation?

What is the motivation

for does Congress,

somebody in Congress

who gets a three million kickback

from insurance companies per year

have to change anything?

The voters.

But voters don't care.

Because remember that guy earlier

who said,

always vote for the lesser of two evils?

Or, you know,

vote for this party.

I told you,

the most dangerous voters in America

are straight ticket voters.

People that say,

I'm voting D or R all the way down

no matter what,

most dangerous voters in America.

Most dangerous voters in America.

Because they are,

that's just,

I have to,

I don't care about the person,

I don't care about the policy,

I care about the letter next to their name.

That's what keeps this country running.

The problem is,

is that we will never, ever

actually start voting people out.

Because number one,

you've got to vote in the primaries.

And number two,

you have to,

you have to be more together.

And we get more divided.

Right?

We get more and more divided.

Like that asshole earlier, right?

Try, try,

blame me for some kind of fucking,

you know,

saying that I said something

he disagreed with months ago

so everything else I say is invalid

and I'm a hypocrite

and I'm like that.

He's the type of guy

that will always disagree with me

no matter what

because we disagreed on something one time.

Even if it was true.

Right?

You're gonna see that.

And I know that it's like,

I'm just telling you something.

It's like,

why tell us this

if there's nothing we can do about it?

We can.

But we won't.

It's gonna take something fucking,

just serious for us

to finally figure this shit out.

One of them is having a third party.

But every time I vote for a third party,

guess what I hear?

You wasted your vote.

You wasted your vote.

It's stupid.

You're dumb.

You're stupid for wasting your vote.

And guess what?

Those same people who tell you that

will then go back and complain

that their candidates are shitty

and they have to vote for the lesser two evils.

They punch themselves in the face.

And that's why when somebody tells me

I wasted my vote,

I say,

then shut the fuck up

and be happy with what you have.

Because you're discouraging people from being it.

I voted for a libertarian for president in 2016.

May sound stupid.

But I knew that if enough votes in Florida happened,

even though I'm not a libertarian,

I just wanted,

I knew they had the best chance.

All they needed was 3% of the vote

to qualify for the ballot.

Going forward.

And guess what?

3.3%.

My vote actually fucking mattered more than yours did.

Because your vote was one of 50 or 60 or 70 million.

My vote mattered more than yours

because my vote,

made a difference.

My vote got a third party automatic ballot qualifications.

That's one step closer.

Do I think the libertarian party is the party I want to be in charge?

No, fuck no.

I don't want any party to be in charge.

But I did something.

I actually,

my wasted vote

was more important or more impactful than your fucking vote.

But you don't see that

because you're so blinded by the,

this is what I was told.

Not you,

but like to a person out there.

Okay?

So,

when I hear

you wasted your vote,

I hear,

and I,

I say,

okay,

well,

I'm trying,

at least I'm trying to do something

to change the system.

But if you think we need to have better candidates,

you need more competition.

And if,

if,

if,

if you're shitting on people trying to create more competition,

then where are we at?

Wouldn't rank choice voting help this problem?

Yeah.

Yeah.

But we don't have that.

You have to try to break the system from within sometimes.

That's an ego vote?

No,

I'm not an ego vote.

I'm saying that I hear a lot things like that

and this is how I think.

It doesn't bother me

because I know what I'm doing.

What I'm doing is my vote.

It's my vote.

It's my vote.

It's not yours.

I can do with it what I want.

I can use it.

I cannot use it.

It's mine and mine alone.

And I refuse to,

you know,

you know,

it's the same thing with my money,

right?

Like how I invest.

It's my investment.

It's my money.

I'm not even telling other people to do what I did.

I'm just telling you what I did

because I'm not afraid of,

of,

of pushback.

Do you have a list of these things?

So many issues to fix.

I,

I've never created a,

a,

a list.

I just,

I just know these things

because I follow them

and I,

and I,

and I,

at least what I see.

Everybody's going to see things differently,

but you know,

there's,

there's a lot of issues out there.

I'm just the type of person who,

I look at a problem

and I don't say,

this is a problem.

Someone else solve it.

Or what's the easy way to fix it?

I'm like,

how do we actually,

you know,

fix this?

You know,

how do we,

we don't just put tape on it,

right?

Cause then it's going to break again.

So stop putting tape on it.

Let's,

let's fix it.

So it stops breaking

or at least,

you know,

we have,

we don't have to change it every,

every now and then.

And that's kind of how I,

I try to dissect these things.

The country is irreparably broken.

I don't want to say that it's broken.

I want to say that it's,

it's fractured,

right?

It's fractured,

but it's not split off,

right?

Like it's,

it,

it's at a point where I don't even know how to,

how to describe it.

It feels,

it feels like we're turning into a Sims,

a,

a,

a,

what is it?

A civilization game.

Right?

Fractured,

but whole?

No.

Oh God,

no,

no.

I meant like a,

like a,

like a civilization.

Like we're,

we're becoming fractured instead of it being like black versus white or right versus left.

It's like we're getting several groups that are,

are coming up and,

and,

and they're becoming larger as individual groups,

right?

Everything is getting fractured,

but then creating its own thing.

So,

so while we're not more divided,

we're more separated.

I'm not going to listen to RFK right now.

Late stage capitalism.

You think,

you think being fractured is,

is,

is,

is like unique to capitalism or something?

How do you incentivize people to actually vote in primaries and local elections?

Education.

Um,

education is the most important thing.

People don't understand the primaries.

Um,

it's not talked about.

There's no fanfare about it.

Um,

and so people don't even think about it.

Uh,

they think oftentimes primaries are,

are,

are something that,

you know,

it's already,

it's already set.

We already know who it's going to be.

It's just a,

you know,

it's a formality before the,

the,

the election.

And then number two is,

is actually,

um,

making it a national holiday,

uh,

and giving people the ability to vote.

But politicians care about the primaries and only the primaries.

It's funny how politicians care about the,

the one thing that,

uh,

that,

that,

that the,

the,

the people that elect them don't care about.

See,

politicians care about the primaries.

You care about the general election.

They know once they win the primary,

they're winning the general election.

Unless they're in a swing state or there's some crazy grassroots thing.

They just got to win the primary.

They focus on the primary and their voters that go out and vote older people,

people that know about it,

educated people.

That's who they care about.

They care about the primaries.

That's why they want the primaries to be very,

very little fanfare because if they are,

they have more control over and the parties of Democrats,

Republicans,

whatever,

whatever party it is and the candidate has more control over getting elected.

The less people vote in the primaries,

they have to spend less money,

less time and focus only on a very small portion of their,

their base to get the votes to win their primary.

And once they win the primary,

if they're in a hard blue or a hard red area,

then they're going to win the general election.

So they don't want people to know about the primaries because they,

they need the lowest amount of people to vote in the primaries as possible.

You understand?

Because that's where they win elections.

They win elections in the primaries,

not in the fucking general election.

Just like the,

the,

the,

the,

the,

the presidential,

even in the,

in the,

for the general election.

You know how we talk about the,

they don't talk much about the primaries.

You just kind of show up at when you see who won the primary.

You didn't even vote in it.

Do you know how many people do that?

People will watch the primary votes and not have voted in it because it doesn't seem like it matters to them.

They're like,

Oh,

who is going to be the,

who is going to be decided the,

the candidate for me to,

to vote for in the general election.

So they don't do a lot of fanfare.

They do fanfare on it.

Like Iowa's because it's the first,

it's a go and stuff like that.

And,

but that's where it's at.

The primaries are the most important thing.

That's where you get elected.

And because people aren't educated on that and they don't have time to go vote,

right?

It,

it,

it's never going to change.

If you,

the,

obviously we need to fix the system,

but if you can't change the system,

you've got to change the outcome and you've got to give people the ability to actually do it.

And most people don't understand.

They're like,

why do we always have such shit candidates?

Why do we never have good,

good candidates?

Why is there never a candidate I believe in?

Because the candidates are pre-selected.

These candidates know their voter bases,

older people,

retired people,

people that,

that are educated,

people that have,

you know,

have money and don't have to work two,

three jobs and pick their kids up from like that.

So they have nannies and stuff like that.

That's who they go.

And that's why they only focus on the issues for older people,

wealthy people,

retired people.

And that's why you realize that every election cycle,

it's the same bullshit over and over again,

because they,

they only have to get those people,

not you.

You don't fucking matter.

You're going to be a good little fucking sheep and vote for D or R,

D or R or D or R or D or R.

They don't care.

They don't have to care about you.

You're going to vote for them regardless,

but they have to get elected.

And the good candidates are buried in the primaries because the ones that want to,

that you like or would like get no airtime,

no votes from you because you don't know about it.

They purposely make it difficult and uninformed in the primaries.

So chicken and egg,

because no one is showing up.

To vote in people who will actually push through change and make voting more accessible or fund education.

I'm doing the best I can.

I don't even hear the political fucking streamers talk about this shit.

Why?

Because they're fucking bought and paid for too.

They,

they just want the fucking status quo.

All I can do is,

is inform you.

I have not stopped about being,

being informed about your local elections more than the national elections because those people control your life more.

Your,

your,

your,

your,

your school superintendent,

your,

your comptroller,

your treasurer,

your,

your,

your mayor,

your,

uh,

city council,

your fucking sheriff,

your judges.

Those people could have more impact on your daily life than any other politician.

Then on top of that vote in the primaries,

know your candidates know who you're voting for.

Don't be,

I'm trying.

I'm a,

I'm a finance person,

but I still try to do that.

The problem is,

is that there is no incentive in doing so.

There is no incentive for people with a large audience to do that because that's not what brings in clicks.

Nobody wants to,

nobody cares about the primary.

Nobody wants to hear you talk about some fucking boomer bullshit that they,

they think about and they think of Ames,

Iowa,

and a bunch of fucking old people in a gymnasium fucking arguing and shit about delegates and,

and quorums and shit.

No,

tell me why Trump is a Nazi and why Biden is a fucking,

uh,

puppet sleeper agent for the fucking,

uh,

socialist fucking,

uh,

Manchurian candidates and shit like it.

That's what people want to hear.

That's what people want to hear.

They want to hear what clickbaits that that's what they want.

And then it is what it is.

No,

I haven't found a new G,

uh,

uh,

gym yet.

I cannot find a gym around here that has a boxing thing.

I have to go all the way to Philadelphia for that.

It's insane.

The only,

the only gym around here that has boxing,

uh,

equipment or heavy bags is like someplace that's open from 6am to 8am.

Then one to,

oh,

sorry.

So then 12 to one 30,

then four to six.

Hassan is always talking about this,

but you definitely a lot more less shackled.

So to say,

I guys,

when I say content creators,

you know,

there's more than just one or two people,

right?

I'm talking about the news.

I'm talking about podcasts.

I'm talking about independent media that,

okay.

I'm not,

wasn't,

wasn't calling or talking about a specific individual.

I know we're on Twitch,

but I meant like in,

in,

in like overall,

you know,

environment.

There's some in Wilmington by me,

bro.

Where are we invited to your house for a Christmas meal?

I don't know how Christmas is going to go.

Bale's not doing well right now.

He's got an appointment tomorrow.

I really hope,

I really hope it's just the chemo that's messing him up.

All right.

All right.

I got a sponsored segment coming up.

This is going to be funny.

Because,

um,

I'm gonna learn about something new today.

And I think it's going to be,

I hope it goes well.

I like to learn things.

I like when I'm paid to learn things.

Could you do a whiteboard on the panel of papers?

I have before,

actually.

I've been using base for over a year.

It's great and cheap.

Um,

I haven't,

um,

I haven't used it yet,

but I,

I wanted to,

you know,

obviously it's,

it's a new thing by Coinbase and they wanted to,

they're like,

Hey,

can you like show people our new thing?

And I'm like,

yeah,

sure.

And they're like,

can you check it out?

I looked at,

I looked at it and I'm like,

okay,

I don't really understand a lot of it,

but maybe I can learn it.

And there's people here that,

that may know more about this than I do.

I'll explore it.

All right.

No,

I don't endorse something,

um,

that I don't use.

Uh,

if I haven't used it,

I'm not going to be like,

this is exactly what you need to use and stuff like that.

But it seems like a lot of people use it and I'll check it out and with you guys.

And we'll,

we'll check it out together.

Trump meeting has begun.

Why is it not showing?

Can you whiteboard how to scam old guys out of a 2000?

For Toyota Camry?

No,

but we sold a 2006.

The hell?

It must be beginning now.

All right.

So I got a piece.

So let's do marbles again real quick.

Uh,

then we come back.

I've got about five minutes until we do the segment while we check out this,

this new thing.

I'll do the 50 year mortgage whiteboard and then we'll move into it.

Okay.

All right,

let's do it.

Get in,

You have some questions about high frequency trades later?

I don't know if I'm the right guy for whatever question is.

Oh,

Daniela one,

the Jags blew a 19 point lead yesterday.

Yeah.

30 years of pain,

man.

Funny story.

We went to never,

I told you we,

um,

went to,

uh,

tour.

My daughter's new Catholic school that she's going to be in until summer.

So apparently they had Googled me.

They had a time.

Um,

and that's a different story.

But,

uh,

we get there and they have to buzz us in.

They have to buzz us in and,

um,

they,

we get in there and there's this lady,

she's like in her sixties and she's like this and she's like,

well,

so nice to meet you.

And we're talking and walking and stuff like that.

And,

um,

she's just being very polite and she goes,

um,

she goes,

uh,

yeah.

So where are you guys coming from Florida?

Right.

And we said,

yeah,

she goes,

I have some family in,

um,

in Tampa and,

um,

my brother,

he lives in Jacksonville and my wife,

uh,

looked at me,

looked at me and he says,

Oh,

he likes the Jaguars.

I said,

yeah.

And it's a little late.

She sits up and she goes,

you know,

I was just telling my brother if,

if Trevor Lawrence doesn't have a good year this year,

I think they should get rid of him.

What did little old lady.

And she's like,

she's like,

she's a Philadelphia Phillies fan.

Like she,

or a Philadelphia Eagles family.

She's a football fan.

She starts doing,

I said,

yeah,

I said,

I said,

it's a,

it's a make or break.

She goes,

it's a conference.

I'm like,

okay lady.

And so we,

um,

we go through the thing and she's showing us the classrooms

and I'm being quiet because my wife told me to behave.

And I asked two questions only.

I said,

number one,

I said,

how much is the religion,

you know,

uh,

play into the school?

She goes,

Oh,

we have Sunday.

Like we have like a,

a thing like once a week for like an hour where the kids

sing and they,

and they do a Bible story and stuff like that.

And I was like,

okay,

like that.

And then everything was fine.

And then I said,

can I ask you a question,

um,

about the thing?

I said,

I said,

it's just a question.

I said,

you know,

with today's world and everything like that,

I'm always worried about safety concern.

I said,

are all the doors glass?

And she goes,

what do you mean?

I said,

um,

the,

the,

the entrance door is glass pane.

This is glass pane.

All the rooms are glass.

Now I think that's a very,

very valid question,

right?

Like I'm not trying to,

you know,

trying to cause any shit,

but it got real awkward for a minute there.

And she goes,

um,

yes,

all,

all,

all of the doors are the same.

And I'm like,

you know,

obviously,

you know,

they buzz people in.

She's like,

we don't,

we don't cause she said we,

we,

we don't allow anybody and we don't recognize they have to

buzz in.

We have to ask them where they,

if they're not on the list,

they don't come in.

I'm thinking myself,

it's a glass pane door.

Like if somebody doesn't really,

that's a uniquely American question.

I mean,

it's,

it's a,

it's a,

it's a valid question for as a parent.

No,

I wasn't asking if they were all glass.

I was just saying like,

you know,

so then I said,

um,

is it okay if I,

um,

she,

my,

my wife started asking about my son.

And then there's a lady in the office laughing.

She goes,

well,

she's in charge of the three-year-olds and stuff like

that.

I said,

and I jokingly said,

and I can,

I can hear her laugh and she's used to,

she's used to the gaslighting and she started laughing

really hard.

And I'm like,

oh,

this is,

this is,

this is my kind of,

okay,

I got my ally here.

And then I said,

is it okay that I,

I come in a different costume every day to pick up my

daughter?

Can you expand on that?

What kind of costumes I go,

oh,

I just like to,

you know,

show up in like different,

you know,

outfits and stuff like that.

And,

um,

uh,

I got like Woody and I've got like,

um,

Harry Potter,

which was a little bit,

I got a little bit of a,

of a look for that.

I said,

you know,

Buzz Lightyear,

I said,

Spider-Man,

Superman,

you know,

the,

oh,

she's oh,

okay,

well you might get mobbed by the kids and stuff like

that.

She's like,

as long as you don't have any dresses,

right?

I said,

okay.

And the other lady starts laughing.

And so I'm like,

see,

she's my kind of lady,

right?

And,

and I'm trying to not,

now,

now I have an audience.

I have somebody who's like getting my jokes.

Now,

somebody like me,

the worst thing that can happen is somebody laughs at my

jokes.

That's the worst thing that can happen.

And I'm sitting there next to my wife and she's looking at

me.

She's just looking at me and she knows I'm fighting it.

I'm fighting it because every time somebody says something,

you know,

like,

you know,

I won't say the things that were said,

but you know,

the lady goes,

well,

we try not to make it too hard on the first day.

We try to just ease it in on them.

And I'm like,

and my wife is like,

don't.

And I'm just like,

I hear these kinds of things,

like,

you know,

these,

these pervert jokes,

you know,

whatever I'm doing my best.

And I get to the end,

I get to the end,

I get to the end.

And finally the lady was like,

well,

we can probably make an exception for your son,

but it's going to,

you know,

it,

it,

it comes with a price,

like a joke.

The good news is that she's accepted into the school,

but they asked me,

they,

at the end,

they go,

they go,

what is,

what is,

what is it exactly that you do?

I said,

I,

I,

I stream for a living.

You know,

I,

I talk about,

you know,

finance and economics and stuff like that.

And she goes,

oh yeah,

I,

I saw it's the stock guy,

right?

And I go,

my husband's a CPA though.

I'll have him look into it.

Now I've never been a long time since I've looked up.

Okay.

That's not bad.

Yeah.

That's not bad actually.

Okay.

If they,

if they,

if they just looked here,

it's not that bad.

Maybe it's a good thing.

Renowned Twitch streamer linked to cultist.

Wait,

what?

This was live.

By the way,

I didn't know what he was going to say.

I didn't know anything.

I just said the way he's talking reminds me of guy from Pulp Fiction.

We put it on and it was,

it matched up perfectly in real time.

I did not ruin Hot Wheels.

Click the Reddit link.

Are there any stock chairs that aren't full of shit?

What are you talking about?

What Reddit link?

Are there any you date?

Trading YouTubers that aren't full of shit.

What does that have to do with me?

I don't know who any of these people are.

I don't think anybody mentioned me and if they did,

it's way at the bottom.

Control F.

No, not there.

So you're full of shit,

I guess.

All right, whatever.

As scruffy as you are right now,

your shit's lined up pretty clean.

We talking about my face?

Bro, I just ran into them this morning and just kind of

did whatever I had to do.

It did say YouTubers.

Oh, okay.

All right, so let's do the whiteboard real quick.

I'm going to be late to my sponsored segment,

but that's okay.

All right, let's talk about 50-year mortgages.

All right, so there's been a lot of talk about 50-year

mortgages, all right, and I can't understand why people

think this is a good thing.

I mean, there's going to be people out there that say it

makes it more affordable, more attractive for first-time

homebuyers to get in.

No, it is not.

It is a fucking scam, okay?

It is a scam, okay?

Let me explain to you something, okay?

People will forget what a car, you know,

at 144 months does, okay?

Now, obviously, I'm going to give you a difference right now, okay?

I am going to put a $500,000 house, okay?

And I am going to put it at 6%, okay?

And I'm going to do a 15-year, a 30-year, and a 50-year mortgage,

and I want you to see what happens here, okay?

So I'm going to do $500,000, and I'm going to put 10% down payment, okay?

That's a lot for some people, but we're going to put 10% just because, right?

So we're going to put $50,000 down payment, which, again, is probably not happening for

most people.

But let's just do it for the sake of argument, okay?

Alright?

Now, your loan amount is going to be $450,000, okay?

So your loan amount is $450,000.

Now, remember, this is a $500,000 house, okay?

It's a $500,000 house.

Now, one thing to remember is that amortization takes place.

And what is amortization?

That is where you pay, because you're going to pay the bank first.

You pay interest first, okay?

Meaning that your payments, over time, will look like this.

Interest principle.

Interest principle.

It isn't until year 20, on a 30-year fixed mortgage, where you start seeing it go like

this.

You pay the interest first.

You are renting from the bank first.

So the longer you have it, the more interest.

The more interest you pay first, okay?

Now, the crazy thing about this is, is that while most people take 20 years to get to

amortization, the average time that people own a home in America is 11 to 12 years, which

means that most people never actually get anything on their house.

They pay all the interest, and then the bank says thank you, and then they sell the house

and move to another one and start all over again, okay?

That's what's wild about this.

But I'm going to give you an idea of what this is going to happen, okay?

At a 15-year, remember, the shorter the amount of the loan, the higher the monthly payment

is.

The higher the mortgage is, right?

Because you have to tackle more in a shorter period of time, okay?

But you can pay extra on principle.

We know that.

I've been preaching that for a long time.

Now, if I put this on a 15-year loan, okay?

And we're going to put PMI, because you're going to have to have PMI on about a half

a percent, okay?

Okay?

This is what the chart looks like, okay?

This is what your chart looks like, okay?

You're going to have your down payment and everything like that, okay?

But your mortgage payment, okay, is generally going to be per year, right?

You will pay about, let's see, monthly payments about $4,300, $4,350, okay?

Another $187 in PMI if you don't pay it down, okay?

$50,000 down payment.

Okay?

So, you're going to pay that much, all right?

You're going to pay that much.

And as you can see here, your principle, which is the dark right here, you get that a lot

quicker, right?

You get that a lot quicker because you're paying it more in a shorter period of time.

So, you're going to hit amortization at about year six.

That's about halfway through, right?

Just like on a 30-year mortgage, almost 30 years, a little bit more.

And as you can see here, your principle, you're going to be attacking more.

Now.

It's not going to be higher, right?

$4,000 something a month, okay?

But you're attacking more in a shorter period of time.

That's unaffordable for some people, okay?

So, when I pull this up here, it's going to show you that after 15 years, you will have

paid $756,000 in 15 years, okay?

That is how much you will pay for this house, okay?

You're all set.

Okay?

You're also going to pay $250,000 a month in taxes, $125,000 average in home insurance,

okay?

So, you know, taxes are $45,000.

You're going to pay money, okay?

You're going to pay about $45,000 in taxes, okay, and you're going to pay about $22,500

in homeowner's insurance.

So, your total cost in 15 years, just at that point, is going to be around $830,000, give

or take.

So, in 15 years, you will have paid $830,000 a month.

You're going to have paid $7,500 for a $500,000 house.

Now, the house gains an average of 3% a year, right?

So, it's going to offset a little bit, but that's if you do it in 15 years.

Now, let's go to a 30-year fixed mortgage, okay?

Your payment comes down, all right?

Your payment comes down from $4,000 something a month to around $3,260.

So, you say to yourself, okay, my payment, my payment has dropped almost $1,000 a month.

almost a thousand dollars a month great but your taxes your insurance you will now pay for that

same house 1.122 1,200,000 I can't even do it 1,122,771 dollars you gotta factor in the increase

in interest rate when going from 15 to 30 30 to 50 I'm trying to just do a basic one so people

can see this right here okay is he really explaining like we are five I'm not explaining

to you I'm explaining to people who don't understand this okay so as you can look at this

here you're going to see that you will now pay 1.122 million dollars for this house most people

don't keep their house for 30 years you are paying most of that interest up front look at this chart

when you see the 30 year okay look at this you don't hit amortization until 25

that means all of that money that you've been paying is all interest you're not really building

much equity when you make a monthly payment it is going to be 20 years until you make a payment

and more goes to the principal of the house and of the loan than on the interest now let's do a 50

year you don't hit amortization until 2065 your payment comes down what was it at 30 remember a

car dealer doesn't have to sell you

a car they have to sell you a payment same thing with a mortgage okay go back to 30

$3,260 a month guess what ladies and gentlemen I can save you 300 bucks a month I can save you

$300 a month we can finally afford a home we can finally afford a home and you will pay

one point or one million seven hundred thousand dollars for that home if you keep it 50 years

you're not going to you're going to die but the bank is going to collect $971,000 in interest from

you $971,000 you are going to pay in interest to the bank this is worse than

renting at this point okay this is worse than renting because look at this this is you don't

Don't hit amortization until 40 years from now.

How about the equity you'll build

because all the idiots will get 50-year loan

causing more inflation in real estate?

You're never going to see,

you're never going to get to the point

where you get to realize any of that.

Because look at this.

Let's say you sell at the average of 12 years.

You have paid in 12 years,

which is the average time somebody keeps a house.

You will have paid $25,560 in interest

and only put $2,800 in the principal.

Not including 5% per year in non-returnable capital

of taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA, the whole nine yards.

I'm sorry, that's per year.

Excuse me.

Let me do that right.

You will have paid about $300,000 in interest

and made about $30,000 in principal.

So imagine $971,000.

Does this account for appreciation?

Again, those of you guys asking about appreciation,

even if you add in the 3% per year,

you haven't put, you've only paid interest.

Remember, this isn't,

the reason that I'm bringing this up

is even if you were to get 3% per year,

okay, for the 10 years,

let's say you get 35% increase in the value of the home.

It doesn't really matter

because you've paid more out of pocket

than you will get back for that.

Don't add in closing costs,

add in all the other bullshit.

You haven't gained anything.

You're basically renting

and it's even a higher than a regular rent.

Wouldn't this possibly inflate houses

because people will say $300 a month,

say that they think afford a bigger house?

Yes, no.

It does until people realize what happens to them.

Look at the car market right now.

Okay.

Look at the car market.

What's called voluntary repossessions

has been spiking

because people are thinking,

oh, I can get into a car now

because they offer $140,000.

$140,000 a month payments of plans.

In the short term,

it'll bring housing prices up.

But what happens when all of these people realize

that they're paying $4,000 a month

in interest and tax and insurance

and HOA and maintenance

and they gained 200 bucks in principle?

What do they do then?

They go underwater?

They sell it for a loss?

I have a serious question.

What if I take the 50-year mortgage

and use the money saved to lower payments

to pay down the rent?

What if I take the 50-year mortgage

and use the money saved to lower payments to pay down the rent?

What if I take the 50-year mortgage

and use the money saved to lower payments to pay down the rent?

What if I take the 50-year mortgage

and use the money saved to lower payments to pay down the principal?

Good luck finding somebody

that'll let you pay down principal early

on a 50-year mortgage.

And second of all,

that $200 offset on a $500,000 loan

is still going to screw you over.

Okay?

Now, go back to a 30-year, right?

Which, by the way,

30 years are bad in themselves.

Okay?

You're only paying $300,000 more a month,

but $250,000,

$400,000 less.

I'm sorry, $400,000 less

in interest paid.

Okay?

Now, if I bring this to,

let's say I go all the way down to 4%.

Even at 4%,

you'll pay $921,000

on this.

Let's go to a 50-year.

If you pay it to completion,

$1.3 million.

But it's not about

how much you pay

because we're thinking this is keeping it to completion.

The average,

home ownership time of a home

is 12 years,

11 to 12 years,

which means almost everyone will pay only,

will never get to amortization.

But at least with a 30-year,

you're getting close at 12 years.

With a 50-year,

you've just rented from the bank.

You've rented for the bank

and any fucking increase you get,

you're going to lose in non-returnable capital.

Sure, there's tax implications of depreciation

and stuff like that.

I'm talking about from a basic,

from a basic knowledge.

So, again,

people are going to argue and say,

well, this is a good deal

because it gets more people in the door.

Yeah, sure.

But the problem is,

is that five steps into the door,

there's no floor.

So while we celebrate the entry,

we don't realize the ramification

and they're not going to tell kids this.

They're going to say,

I can get you an adjustable rate mortgage.

And most of them aren't going to qualify for this

because in a lot of cases,

you have to make several times

your monthly,

monthly income

of what the payment's going to be.

So some mortgages will not give you a good mortgage

if you make,

if your monthly payment

is going to be $4,000,

they're going to expect you to make $12,000 a month

before they qualify you

at any decent type of mortgage.

Now, some of you guys will say,

well, what about this and that?

Sure, you guys may be,

but I'm talking about the general person

going in to buy a house.

How do you exploit this?

Do the opposite of what I'm doing

and tell them why it's awesome

and then sell it to them?

Is this unprecedented?

No, because we talked about last year

how they're introducing 1% down payment mortgages now.

You got PMI on top of that.

And then just so you guys know

that I'm not just pulling this out of my butt.

Okay, look at this.

This is actually something that I saw

when I came into to pick up my family

from Philadelphia.

Airport on Tuesday of last week.

I don't know why I have so many pictures of billboards

since I got here,

but this was the billboard that I saw

going into the Philadelphia airport on Tuesday.

Welcome home with a 40-year mortgage.

Have you considered changing your channel name

to the Financial Literacy Guy?

I know too boring,

but really that seems to fit you better.

Love your stuff.

No, I can't do that now.

This was before the announcement of the 50-year.

They're already offering.

That house is running ads to pay for their mortgage.

Look how happy they are.

Okay, Kahi, that's...

Okay.

Now, if you do end up getting roped into

a longer-term mortgage

because it's the only way you can afford to get in,

okay?

I've talked about renting short-term

versus buying, whatever.

Try your hardest.

Do some shopping around.

Everyone's afraid to shop around.

Everyone's afraid to talk about it

and intimidated.

Get your knowledge.

Go in there and make sure

that you can get a mortgage or a loan

that allows you to make additional payments,

or principal payments without penalty.

That is the only fucking way

that this could work out for you.

Okay?

Because if you're able to do this to get in

and then, you know, you get a job change

or you have some more income or something like that

and you're able to put more,

you can significantly lower

how much interest you pay over time

just because you're attacking the principal.

Because for every $100 on a 50-year

that you pay off the principal,

you're talking about four or five times that much.

That's an interest that you're saving.

Wait, that's normally not allowed?

Oh, dude, they bake it in to not allow you to

because you don't know any difference.

Most younger people don't know anything about this stuff.

They go into a bank or they go into a lender

and they feel out of, you know,

they dress up all nice.

They talk all nice.

They bring all their records.

They want to look,

thinking that they have to impress the bank

when they don't have to.

I did a whole video on why the actual setup of the bank

and how the lenders,

and everything like that is all psychological.

They want you to feel that way.

So you do what they say

and they make it seem like they're doing you a favor

when you're the one they need,

but you don't know that

or you don't show that

and you don't have other options lined up

and therefore, you know,

you get taken advantage of.

How many people do you think

in their late 20s, early 30s or 40-year-olds now

going to get a loan from a bank

and understand how everything works?

Or they have a bunch of keywords

and then they use it

and the banker sees,

tests them,

and to see if they really know,

they fumble one of it

and then it's game over.

It's like sharks in the water.

Okay?

Going in and understanding amortization,

understanding, you know,

how much is going to interest,

understanding the setup of it,

understanding a variable versus a fixed mortgage,

understanding, you know,

just the ability to be able to say,

to talk to them and say,

you know, I've been speaking with,

you know, this company, this company, this company,

and I'm just, you know,

I'm comparing my options right now.

That's the first thing.

That's important.

Saying you're comparing your options is huge

because then they know that they're not the only one, right?

Keeps them honest, right?

It's like, it's like, it's like,

I can't make jokes right now,

but that's important.

And then once you tell them that,

you say, listen, I've spoken to, you know,

and do the research and do talk to those people,

you know, there's other, there's other lenders

and say, you know, you know, I, you know,

I spoke with them and if it is,

and, and, and, you know, I'm really interested

in some of the offers they have.

I'm really interested with you guys too.

I've worked with you a long time or bank.

You've got a good reputation.

The only thing is, is that I wanted to see

if you're able to match them and do,

waive the penalty for earlier or later

or additional payments.

And they're not usually not going to let you walk.

If that's the only caveat,

if they really think you're going to walk

over something like that,

they're not going to,

because the amount of money they're going to make

off of you in interest is insane.

And that little bit,

and even in the best way for me to always do it

is to say, you know, is it possible to do that?

If I want to throw an extra hundred bucks or so

on the, on,

on it every month, you know,

I just want to make sure I don't get penalized for that.

A hundred bucks is nothing then.

Okay.

Did you call the vet?

You sent an email.

Well, the one that he went to and ask if,

if, if it's possible to pick up the,

the vomiting medicine because we thought we had it,

but we left it at our other house

and he's been vomiting and,

and he's not keeping anything down.

Everything's liquid and he's not doing well.

We have an appointment tomorrow.

So should we wait until tomorrow

or should we come get the medicine now?

Hold on.

Let me put you guys on mute for a second.

All right, guys, we're back.

Sorry about that.

Having a little personal issue here at home.

All right.

All right.

Moving on.

I hate it here.

I know.

All right.

Well, we didn't get Trump's talk with the Syrian president.

So damn plug actually pop back up.

Monday's doing really good.

Got those shares.

Wish I would've got those calls.

All right.

So now that we got that,

the, the 50 year mortgage,

we'll talk some more about it tomorrow.

If we get any more news about it,

we got a lot more to go over tomorrow too,

with updates from the, from the house.

Now it seems like they're kind of coming on board

with passing something.

Um, but not sure.

I really don't,

don't know what to take from anything these days.

Uh, it's like a,

it's like a day at a time kind of,

uh, kind of a situation here.

So that's on Dave Ramsey.

I mean,

I think Dave Ramsey has a lot of good things

that help people that are Dave Ramsey's like the AA

to alcoholics for people that are like addicted to spending

or like have like severe,

uh, money problems.

But, um, I disagree.

Well,

with him on a lot of things that when it comes to like,

you know,

building wealth with debt or,

um,

living life a little bit when you're younger and stuff like

that.

So I think that there's a,

there's a select audience that I,

that,

that,

that my advice or my opinions help.

And I think his is the same way.

That's on Gordon Ramsey.

Uh,

I don't know Gordon Ramsey.

Um,

but Jamie Oliver is better.

Yo,

Rivian popping right now.

Joe be going nuts.

So five,

7%

Palantir is seven percent.

I don't even know who Jamie Oliver is.

I just know that,

that,

that there's like,

a running joke there.

Bourdain,

the goat.

I don't think he's still alive.

Auto mod hitting people today.

I don't know.

Maybe,

um,

maybe,

uh,

something updated with auto mod.

Thoughts on Jalen Ramsey.

Toxic.

Great player.

Toxic.

That's a Michael Bolton.

Today,

Michael Bolton or 1980s,

Michael Bolton,

80s,

Michael Bolton.

I don't know.

All right,

listen,

I'm gonna do a sponsored segment.

Keep up with it after we're done.

All right,

we're going to check something out together.

Coinbase told me they got something new out called base.

Now,

I'm not a crypto guy.

I think everybody knows that,

but I said,

I'd give it a look.

And they told me,

check it out.

If you don't,

if you think it's shit,

say it's shit.

I said,

okay,

so I'm going to look at it.

Not based,

base.

Okay.

So shout out to Coinbase for,

uh,

for,

for,

for reaching out and saying,

Hey,

check out our thing and be honest.

Most,

most companies wouldn't do that.

So I'm gonna take a look at it.

Some of you guys have used it.

I have not.

I would love to hear what you guys think,

but I'm going to check it out.

So what I know about it,

at least from,

from,

from what I've,

what I've dabbled around with is that it's got a lot of different options and it offers a lot of things like,

you know,

you guys that do crypto,

it's got,

you know,

companies that do,

uh,

shares via token or online digital shares.

I don't know anything about it.

So I want to check it.

Base is a good alternative to ETH.

Okay.

Is this an honest first check?

Really?

Yeah.

Are we trading futures?

No.

That's rage bait.

Well,

I don't know.

I like to,

I like to,

I like to hear what you guys have to say because people who have used it,

uh,

know about these things more than I do.

Okay.

So I'm going to check it out.

They should have called it coin based.

That would have actually been pretty good.

All right.

So let me take a look here.

All right.

So what I was told when I checked it out with them is they said,

Hey,

listen,

you're not into crypto trading,

right?

Stocky.

I said,

no.

I said,

you know,

you can check that part out,

but you like companies,

you like companies and shares and stuff like that.

And you'd like to look at charts.

And I said,

yes,

I do.

I'm a nerd for charts.

So they said,

listen,

if you want to check out our site,

check it out by using,

you know,

a couple of these other things.

Now,

one of them is called Dune.

Are you guys familiar with Dune?

Not the movie.

It's like,

it's fun.

I like to learn new,

new,

uh,

you know,

resources to grab stuff from.

Dune was mid.

I'm not talking about the movie.

Lizabal Guy.

No.

The popcorn bucket.

No.

The thing in the desert.

No.

So apparently,

Dune is one of the things they use to look up this stuff.

So I want to look it up.

I'm going to look it up.

I want you guys to,

to,

to tell me what's something good to look up.

The other one was something called Gecko,

right?

Coin Gecko.

I'm learning here,

guys.

You guys are going to learn with me.

The insurance?

No,

not the insurance.

I was looking at this one.

It's called Syrup.

I just liked it because it was called Syrup.

Where did Syrup go?

Wrapped bacon?

No,

wrapped Bitcoin.

All right.

You guys that are more into crypto itself will know some of these things.

I like to look,

look at companies.

So what's a company?

Pepe,

I swear to God.

BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund.

Oh my God.

$1?

What is this?

New?

Wait,

BlackRock has a liquidity fund?

I thought I was BlackRock's liquidity.

It's a stable coin?

I don't know,

guys.

I'm legitimately looking through this.

I,

I,

I don't,

I'm looking at it right here.

I'm,

I'm learning as well as you guys are.

Or some of you guys already know a lot about this stuff.

So I'm checking it out.

All right.

I want to go to this dune right here.

All right.

Explore data.

Meme coin wars.

I'm not doing meme coins.

Some of you guys are into that stuff.

I'm not.

Prediction markets.

Okay.

Let me go up to where I was before.

Check out wrapped.

No.

Can you guys act like adults for five seconds?

Yes.

Jeff,

for those of you guys who are in,

in,

right now,

you'll see,

Jeff is,

is losing his mind right now.

And I think it's hilarious.

All right.

A lot of this is,

is,

is,

is different is different coins.

I see,

but I want to see like,

where is the info?

I want to see charts.

I want to see companies because they offer companies that actually,

um,

are like private companies that issue shares,

but instead of on the exchange,

they do it via electronic,

like,

I guess you call them tokens or whatnot.

Look at hyper liquid trading view pro.

No,

I like to,

I like to,

I like to look at these things.

I like to learn about new things.

I don't know if it's good or bad.

I'm looking through it right now.

Why are you showing dune and get a coin gecko?

And they aren't owned by Koi base.

Cause this is where you find the information.

If you want to study something before you utilize base to,

to,

to,

to either trade it or own it because I'm looking at it from here.

I'm just,

I'm just checking it out.

Um,

I know it has the ability for some people to be able to actually,

uh,

use the ETH,

uh,

blockchain to,

to,

to create stuff.

I'm learning from you guys actually,

um,

click on a dang coin.

Okay.

Sorry.

I'm looking at these things.

I'm just,

I'm,

I'm looking to see what we've got here.

Made in China.

Oh my God.

There's something called made in.

Oh,

coins made it.

Wait,

you can find out what coins are made in China.

What is this?

Pepe on B and B.

I've been thinking about depositing a hundred thousand to base to get the 4%

Bitcoin rewards credit card.

Oh,

I,

I didn't even know that was a thing.

I don't know.

I'm looking at these.

These are interesting.

I just wanted to find one that was a company.

Hold on.

Let me find one of the companies right now.

This is probably more interesting because I like to,

I like to look at the actual companies that do it and not the coins because I

don't understand the coins as much.

Like I know everybody,

everybody knows about coins.

They'll say,

Oh,

well this is the next one or this is the way it's used and proof of function,

proof of work and everything like that.

I,

I'm more of a,

I'm more of a company guy.

I just want to see what the companies that,

that are offering stuff here are.

Let me see.

Bat brave browser token.

All right,

here we go.

Um,

here's an example of one.

I want to check it out.

All right,

what do we got here?

Um,

bite,

uh,

B Y T E.

Let me check out bite.

All right,

let's look for it.

B I T E.

No,

that's boot bit Eagle.

Did I spell it wrong?

Oh yeah.

B Y T E.

All right.

B Y T E.

It's probably not on,

on coin gecko.

It's probably on dune.

Let me check here.

Bite food delivery,

bite masons.

I don't know what that is.

I think I'm looking at it wrong.

Bite by virtuals.

That's on base.

Now I'm not really sure you guys know this stuff more than me.

You got to have a look at it.

You got to help me through this.

I'm trying to,

I'm trying to figure it out.

I need to register a base name.

Look up Tate.

No.

How's bow doing?

No,

this is where you look things up and you can get the information.

If you want to,

if you want to utilize base as the,

as the platform to do it on is Tate,

a real thing.

You guys are gonna get me in,

get me in trouble.

Aren't you?

Daddy Tate.

Oh my virtuals.

What's the site virtuals.

It's not a signal.

These aren't signals.

I'm looking at my God.

That picture is going to have to go.

Let me hop on base.

Look into wild.

It's not a signal.

It's co-founded by Sam Altman and open AI guy.

What is it called?

No,

I'm curious what you wanted.

You guys are looking at.

I don't know.

I really don't know.

I'm learning this with you guys at the same time.

World token.

W Y W L D for 48 months.

Base is on death and death and is a worthless Ponzi rolling on this one right here.

But I played my wife.

This is a good time to buy a second house.

Thoughts.

You want to buy a second house right now?

After what we just did.

With a 50 year mortgage.

Or do you guys want to actually,

you guys are able to afford it.

No guys,

I'm not doing world coin or any of these.

I'm not buying any coins guys.

I'm,

I'm just,

I'm just trying to figure out which ones here are the ones I want to go back to syrup.

Because that's one that was an actual like company.

Am I just typing everything wrong?

Maple syrup.

There we go.

There's some charts.

This is what I'm looking at.

I'm a,

I don't know about this company,

but I'm curious about these actual,

like,

like these companies actually have charts.

That I can look at it,

right?

May have news allocations.

Okay.

That's not bad.

Click live chart.

No,

I'm not trading it.

I'm looking at,

I'm trying to understand how you look at the financials.

Cause it just tells you the markets here.

I want to look at the financials and see where they're at.

Cause they have like,

at least from what I'm seeing,

they have like the ability to actually look at these companies and see what they have.

Well,

there's financials right there.

So you can actually look at the financials,

like a real company fees,

financials guys.

So guys,

I'm not going to look up your,

your,

your little coins.

I'm trying to understand the platform.

They have something.

They said,

Hey,

can you check it out?

I'm checking it out.

I'm trying to understand it.

You guys are way more versed on these things than I am.

Wait,

is that say rupees,

syrup and Indian rupees?

Wait,

what?

Babe,

let me ask her,

should I open my Coinbase thing or am I going to dox myself?

Let me see if I can remember my login.

Don't knowing you,

you're going to dox yourself.

Oh,

I don't even know what email it's under.

Insert your security key.

What?

Oh no.

Guys,

I'm going to dox myself.

I can already feel it.

I wonder if I have any money in my wallet.

Oh,

I got a text,

a verification code.

All right,

let me check it out.

All right,

let's see if I,

if I,

if I have money in here,

I'm,

I need to withdraw it.

Is the password.

No,

that's not the password.

Wait,

why don't have so much stuff being ordered to the house from my wife?

What is she ordering?

My neighbors probably think that we're like doing something.

Oh my God.

So our neighbors have like a bunch of kids stuff in the front yard and we were doing a family walk up there and we haven't seen our neighbors yet.

And so we're doing a walk and I guess they're,

they have the windows open.

They're getting dinner ready.

There's a mom,

the dad,

the kids,

everything like that.

And I just kind of glances,

I'm walking up and I look back and nobody's next to me.

And I look back and all of my family,

my wife,

her mom,

her dad,

and the kids are all standing in front of their yard,

just looking into their house.

And I'm like,

imagine being in a family in a house.

In a home and like the new neighbors get here and you haven't met them.

And then one day you're setting up dinner.

You look out the window and they're all lined up in front of yards,

just looking at you like,

okay,

new device confirmed.

All right,

cool.

All right,

I got this.

I don't want to open up my Coinbase on here.

You all wanted seasons.

Yes,

we did want seasons.

Do not actually show your seed.

You guys have seen my kid before.

Oh,

you mean?

Okay.

All right,

here we go.

I think I'm in.

I think I'm in.

No,

I'm not going to give you my fingerprint.

We're in.

You're not in anything.

Please confirm your tax status.

Wait,

what?

Bro,

I already have your.

Okay,

there we go.

Okay,

I got.

Let me check it.

My portfolio.

Do I have money in here?

I have 18 bucks in here.

What?

Hold up.

I got 18 bucks.

Let's go.

What is it in?

Time to turn into 36 brother.

No,

we're not doing that.

All right,

let me go.

Let me pop off here real quick.

All right,

98% allocation into Bitcoin.

98% of my allocation.

Is in Bitcoin.

Oh,

we got to flip that,

huh?

Got to let that go,

but I'm not.

I'm not making money on my Bitcoin.

I'm making on my Ethereum.

All right,

let's check out base on here.

Here we go.

Base app right here.

I really don't want to tax myself.

Oh,

I got to join a wait list.

Solana.

I'm not going through Solana.

I have a lot of Solana in my personal portfolio in my personal portfolio,

and I'm not like,

you know,

I know I get a lot of crap for this because you guys always like to,

to,

to,

to hate on what I have.

My personal portfolio,

my largest holding is Ethereum,

Solana,

Doge,

Bitcoin,

and now Pengu and Bonk.

But those aren't very,

those aren't very,

very large positions.

Now I had Ethereum back when it dropped under a thousand,

like two years ago,

which is funny because it was the same price it was in 2017.

Sold it in December for four at 4,000 because I needed tax money.

Then it fell.

So I started buying back in under 2000.

It's back up again.

Solana.

I'm in,

I'm in Bonk for fun because of the shot and what they did.

Pengu.

I don't know why I'm in Pengu.

I think somebody in chat said something and I bought like a hundred bucks or

200 bucks with it.

And then I got Doge still from when I bought it for 0.005,

but I sold it the night before Elon Musk went on Saturday night.

Live at like 47.

So I sold it for something like a 15,000%.

It's like,

you don't actually own those cryptos.

If it's not in your own private wallet off of the central exchange,

you don't own it.

Thank you.

My crypto maxis.

I'm aware that I don't physically own it.

I don't plan on physically owning it.

If shit hits the fan,

I can't fucking do shit with it anyways.

So it's like owning physical gold.

Like you don't actually own the gold.

Okay,

cool.

I'm not planning on like utilizing it as a house one day or as food.

One,

one day.

Like I'm,

I,

I,

I don't own,

you think I own 10 small pieces of Microsoft headquarters?

Like I don't own a piece of Microsoft.

Like,

like legitimately,

if the company went bankrupt tomorrow,

they'd be like,

sorry,

bro,

you knew the risks.

Like,

like I'm not even,

I'm not trying to like,

you know,

flush on you,

but you're like trying to remind me I don't own these coins unless they're in

cold storage.

I get it,

but I'm not planning on owning it.

I'm trading it.

I'm,

I'm buying it now to sell for it later.

Like,

that's what I'm doing.

You know what I mean?

I could buy stocks in gold and it's like,

you don't actually own the physical gold.

I understand that.

Like,

I'm fully aware that I don't like physically own it.

But like when I say I own shares of Google,

like on paper,

I own it,

but I don't actually own it.

Let me hold some Bitcoin.

Old man,

diamond hands.

Um,

in that Burr land,

uh,

invest in Marino wool based layers to the family.

We went to Goodwill last night.

Now I messed up by not going to,

to Goodwill on,

um,

on Wednesday because that's when you get all the,

the,

the,

the discounts or whatever.

But we went last night and man,

did we buy a lot of stuff?

Uh,

and it was good because like we were able to get the kids like

full outfits,

like little jackets,

um,

brand new pairs or like new pairs of shoes.

Um,

and we cleared out,

but like if I would've gone on Wednesday,

it would've been nicer.

But somebody said last week they said,

um,

they said,

uh,

you know,

Goodwill in Delaware hits different and I didn't understand what

they meant,

but,

but I guess,

you know,

wait a second.

What is this base build?

I can build something.

You know that the word,

does everybody remember what the word of the year is?

It's for developers,

not built boomers.

Word of the year for 2025 was vibe coding.

Can I vibe code something?

These are for institutions.

These,

there were a lot of things that were once for institutions,

sir.

Vibe coding is for idiots.

Hey,

you watch your tone.

I can't wait for this bubble to pop vibe coding.

Oh,

cause you're a coder.

Hold on.

Let me see if I can code something right now.

Hold on.

Let me see.

Let me test something out right now.

I want to break away for a second.

Who's the best one to use grok.

Can you code for me?

Sure.

I can code for you.

What language?

English.

Oh wait,

what?

Oh wait,

what are you doing?

Wait,

what are you doing?

Wait,

what did I miss?

Can you code a program that allows me to see the most typed stock tickers in my Twitch chat in real time for subbed for 23 months.

English bro almost killed me.

Import Asiago from collections.

Import.

Username token channel update interval.

I don't know what any of that means.

Python Z Z crypto and vibe coding.

I'm in literal hell right now,

bro.

I don't know anything about vibe coding.

I'm just,

I'm just learn to cold old man.

I am learning to code.

Be prepared to debug that for six hours.

I don't know.

Where's my buddy primet.

He loves vibe coding.

Ross Tyra.

I sent him a,

I sent him a DM.

Um,

the morning that it came out and I DM him the,

the news that vibe coding was named word of the year and all his response was is sad.

I'm learning.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I'm not going to,

I'm not going to,

I'm not going to build anything.

I'm not going to break their website,

but I need to figure out how to get on there so I can,

um,

it says I can grow an app on base.

Wait,

what if I wait,

I can build an app.

How hard is it to build an app?

Oh,

no depends.

No,

I'm saying like if they,

if they allow you to build,

okay,

base build,

what will you build?

Ooh.

Oh,

this is an ADHD person's dream right here.

Hold on.

You ever thought about how,

like after,

you know,

sperm enters,

you know,

it gets all the way up there and like the lat,

once the one that,

that,

that gets help and breaks through and then the egg rejects all the other ones.

Like what do they do?

Like,

like they can't get into the egg and they got nowhere else to go.

Do they like play a game of cards while they wait?

Or do they just like,

is it like the matrix that the Latin,

the third movie,

the matrix where they're just like docile,

like floating in the air until they,

women are mass murderers.

Okay.

I don't think that I think it's voluntary,

like so Peku or whatever they become gym bros.

No,

I'm just saying like,

I know they die,

but like they all are the ones that are left over,

rushing to the middle.

Right.

And they're all rushing there.

And then that one gets there,

gets through.

And as soon as he gets through,

like the egg,

like stops all the other ones coming out there,

but there's like a whole bunch of them still hanging out out there.

Like,

like what,

like,

do they just like,

ah,

fuck it.

Good race.

Cause GGS like,

but then they're all hanging out.

Like,

what do they just do?

Like,

like,

like,

like what are you,

I'm sorry.

I'm moving off topic here.

Oh my God.

I don't know what any of this stuff means.

I love all my coders in chat right now who are like losing their mind at me,

talking about potentially coding,

something vibe code,

a sperm simulator to find out I'm not high enough for this.

I really should click out of the stream at 1pm.

No,

I know they get flushed out.

Eventually you want to see me vibe code something.

How do I vibe code?

Can I build right here?

Community.

Wait,

we have communities.

There's a virtual event.

I can show up at a virtual event,

barbecue,

11 office hours.

Wait,

can I just create an event based India?

That's something I haven't heard in a while.

Oh,

I'm thinking of different kind of based.

Ooh,

can I join one of these?

Don't get sucked into project.

Oh,

I don't know how to do any of this stuff.

I don't know how to code anything.

I don't know how to,

I I'm just,

I'm just checking out their site.

I literally have never,

um,

never utilized this platform before and I'm checking it out.

And I think,

um,

I think for the right people,

it's a cool,

cool platform,

um,

for people who like to,

um,

you know,

keep up with certain coins,

but it'd be able to do more,

more DD on them and check out some of these,

uh,

I'm like,

I'm going to do this.

I'm going to check it again,

a different day,

but I want to check it.

I want to find out off screen about how do I actually find the

companies that offer?

Like,

cause here's the thing.

People often ask me,

stocky,

what is your,

what is your opinion on tokens?

Right?

Like tokens,

like tokenize stocks.

And my first,

my first like initial reaction is,

you know,

I don't want anything to do with it.

But one thing I've learned in the,

in the market is as the market,

as I've been longer in the markets and in different types of derivatives and

markets,

stuff like that,

like you can't just write something off because it's new and it feels

different.

And you kind of one of those people where I'm like,

all right,

you know what?

I don't know,

but let me give it a shot.

And so a lot of,

a lot of like Robin hood is doing that.

Now they're offering tokenized stocks and so are like countries in the EU.

And one of the things that some of these businesses do,

um,

one of these businesses do is instead of going and doing a,

an offering where they get like,

um,

they get,

uh,

an underwriting from a large corporation and then they go ahead and,

and,

and then,

you know,

give them a bunch of shares and then they release a certain amount of shares.

They do that in a public offering to raise money.

There's a lockup,

stuff like that.

There's a lot of companies that are private that don't want to go on the public

exchange,

but it's like allowing people to invest directly in private businesses and

they're allowing people to do it via tokens like tokenization.

Like,

basically stocks,

but in a digital tokenized form.

And so I'm learning more about that.

And while I'm very,

very cautious about anybody investing in private companies that don't release,

you know,

aren't required by the FTC and sec to release like all of their data.

I really don't like want newer people like younger,

like,

or,

or like am not say amateur,

but people that are brand new to this,

I don't want them jumping in because they're,

they're not going to understand.

They're going to get caught up with like marketing tools and whatnot.

For some people that do understand,

what they're doing.

I feel like it's a cool opportunity for people to be able to invest in

companies.

Like right now,

for example,

open AI,

right?

I'm not investing in open AI right now,

but open AI is offering a type of tokenized investment,

right?

And so I,

I personally wouldn't get into open AI because I feel like open AI at this

point right now,

there's just scary for me as an investor.

Like I know that if they had shares right now,

a lot of people would jump into them,

but they're already going out and saying to the government,

Hey,

we need you to back,

stop us like these funding deals are absolutely insane.

And there's no way that we're going to be able to pay all this anytime soon.

And we could crash and we're going to need the government,

um,

to potentially backstop that.

So something like open AI,

I wouldn't get into for that reason.

It doesn't mean I'm right or wrong,

but other people might just hear all the hype around opening.

I'd be like,

fuck you.

Let me get tokens for it.

Let me get token.

You know,

let me,

that's basically a digital stock,

right?

So that worries me,

but there's a lot of companies out there that are private,

that,

that potentially are,

are great investment ideas for people that know what they're looking for,

understand the risks they're taking.

And I think that that's something that's kind of cool.

And so when I see that,

whether it's base or somebody else,

they're offering the ability and Robin hood's doing it now too.

It's like mainstream offering the ability for companies to offer investments via

the digital,

basically like digital shares.

I'm really curious to see how it's played.

I want to,

I want to,

I want to dive into it a little bit.

Cause I want to see,

how that works because we know that the Trump administration and via Robin hood

now too is talking about letting people invest in private equity.

And that scares me because I think there's a lot of people who don't understand

the risks associated with private equity and they're just going to jump into it.

And private equity could potentially turn around and use that as exit liquidity

on people.

Just like any stock,

any market,

right?

Like you buy into a stock that does good news and then they do an offering on

you,

right?

They just dump on you.

Um,

and so there's always that concern there,

but I think if you know what you're doing,

it doesn't mean you're going to be profitable,

right?

Because you're always taking on risks of the unknown,

but I think there's opportunities to really get to know private companies and

see their actual balance sheets and see what they're doing and be able to get

into them without the,

the,

the,

the public offering that's going on.

And so that's something that I'm learning more about.

I am,

I am,

um,

in a point right now where I have to evolve with the market and evolve with

what's new and what is,

what is,

you know,

the newest thing,

right?

Because there was a time when you wouldn't,

you wouldn't trade a derivative because there was just too many unknowns or it was too difficult to get in or the cost.

You wouldn't trade stocks because the,

the,

the commission was so high,

right?

Like you wouldn't do options because,

you know,

there was like so much.

And then as the market has evolved,

you either get left behind or you move forward.

I'll give you an example.

Investing in the market.

Now,

nobody 15 years ago would look at the valuation of any stock right now and say,

yeah,

I'm going to buy into that,

right?

Like think about,

think about,

I mean,

Palantir is a great example,

but think about anything.

Think about,

I don't know,

NVIDIA,

even NVIDIA,

right?

You know,

it's got,

it's got back everything it was.

You look at their financials and you say,

wait a second,

they're running at a PE ratio of 53,

right?

And that's down from 144.

Okay.

People wouldn't invest in something with a PE ratio of 53.

That's double the,

the,

the S&P 500.

Okay.

But look at Palantir.

I mean,

NVIDIA,

not alone,

but let me go back to NVIDIA here.

Okay.

If you went back to the stock market 15,

20 years ago,

and you told me that people are buying in,

in billions of dollars.

Okay.

Something that has a,

a,

a PE ratio of 53 market cap of 5 trillion.

Okay.

Compared to the rest of the mag seven versus the rest of the S&P 500.

Absolutely insane.

Right?

Look at Palantir now.

I'm going to vibe code some shit and I'm going to accidentally bring down the fucking,

the world because some dumb ass like me is going to try to vibe shit.

Okay.

Look at this.

Their PE ratio is down to 409.

There is no way 20 years ago,

anybody would touch a stock with a 409 PE down from almost 700 for P is only one 90.

Oh,

okay.

There you go.

That's that,

that makes all.

So the market,

you know,

the market is pricing in accelerated growth.

You know what expectations are,

but that isn't even the real case anymore.

People will say the market is pricing.

No,

it's not.

This is just more money than ever moving into the market,

but not even on speculative.

That's just more people with more money than ever.

Even dollar cost averaging into the market.

That's bringing spy up with spy going up.

And then you've got derivatives,

which all these zero day and short term options traders are forcing derivatives.

Uh,

derivatives are forcing buying,

selling to sell more because it's a profitable market to sell options too,

and they have to cover it.

It causes it to go up and people are saying,

but it's a bubble.

How can anybody buy?

Well,

you're right.

But at the same time,

the value of something is now is what somebody is willing to pay for it,

right?

So there's more money than ever in the world,

more debt,

more margin and more money than ever is going into the market.

But it's not just people that are putting into the market because they're going to be the first ones to sell.

These people aren't underwater on their houses.

They,

they,

they are putting into the 401ks and the last thing they're going to do is sell their equities to pay bills if they can find any other way.

Right?

So I'm not in any worry about that unless we have like a high unemployment,

longterm sustained unemployment for a long period of time.

So I'm not really,

really concerned about that.

But at the same time that's driving the market up and look at the dollar,

right?

Even if I were to take spy price,

discovery works until the one yard line,

I would say you're already in the end zone.

It depends if you come down in bounds or not at this point,

but you take that,

you take the DXY,

right?

I know DXY is not the perfect measure of the dollar.

Okay.

And you pull up a year to day chart.

Okay.

The S&P is up 15%.

The dollar's down almost 9%.

Now,

if you zoom in a little bit here and go just until liberation day.

Okay.

21% differential here.

Okay.

21% differential.

But if you go to year to date,

the dollar has lost 9% of its value.

The S&P is up 16%.

That means the S&P 500 is really only up 7%.

On the year.

So 7% of this year's gains are really not even really there.

Like they are on paper,

but based on the dollar.

Now,

if you look at the dollar strength versus the world currency,

it's even worse.

Okay.

And so you say to yourself,

okay,

so minus minus 9%,

you're talking about 7% gain.

And on top of that,

it's just more money than ever before COVID 45% of Americans had exposure to

the stock market post COVID.

And now it's 62%.

You take an another 20% of the population adding money on a dollar cost

average.

The average American doesn't trade their stocks.

They don't fucking check every day.

They just let their dollar cost average reoccurring by happen.

Add in all the degens.

You've got all that.

But the scary thing though,

is,

is that if you take the mag seven and,

and show it versus the rest of the market,

36% of the S&P 500 is seven companies,

36.7%.

36% of the entire S&P 500 is seven companies.

And when you look at a chart of them versus the rest of the market,

it is almost all the gains.

The S&P 493 is underperforming significantly.

Okay.

Since 2005.

Okay.

Here you go.

Year to date since 20,

this is just 2023.

Let me find,

um,

where's 2025.

Let me find,

2025.

That was last year.

I'll have to find it.

I didn't have it ready,

readily available,

but basically you get,

you get the idea though.

It has been absolutely insane.

The mag seven at the end of the year,

last year,

159%.

The S&P 500,

53%.

And the S&P 500 minus the mag seven,

28%.

Now this isn't the first time this has happened.

I showed you guys a chart where in 2001,

it was very similar to this.

Now,

of course it's different than 2001 because 2001 was just fake companies with,

with.com at the end,

getting trillions of dollars.

Now it's fake companies with AI in the name and open AI partnerships.

But regardless,

the difference is though,

is that back then it wasn't,

it wasn't the retail that had the control.

I'm telling you right now,

it's like the,

it's like the meme with,

um,

with,

uh,

what's his name?

Uh,

from,

um,

what was it?

Uh,

what was the name of the,

um,

the movie?

Uh,

uh,

what's Captain Phillips,

right?

It's like retail is looking at institutions and saying,

look at us.

We are the captain now.

Okay.

Because institutions had the ability to really drive the market,

right?

So one dumps for position for whatever reason,

it starts this and triggers others.

They start selling capitulation happens.

And then there's by that.

Now you can't do that because once one institution starts potentially moving

out of a position,

if it's a,

if retail comes in and buys up that dip,

and then instead of waiting for a lower,

lower,

after being the first one to cause the drop and then trying to be the

first one back in and driving it back up,

they're missing out on the,

on the rebound.

And because retail is coming in and buying it up.

So what do they do?

Less institutions are cutting positions.

A lot of the institutions right now would in no way,

20 years ago,

be holding as much of,

of these,

of these,

of these positions as they are right now,

they'd be scaling out.

They'd be de-risking,

de-leveraging a significantly,

especially with all the economic headwinds we have right now.

Abso-fucking-lutely.

The problem is,

is that every time they did that,

it got bought up and they were,

they were missing out on it.

So now the idea is,

is you got to be careful because it's just a different game now.

Okay.

Thinking retail can stop a real dip is funny.

I,

I never,

I never said that,

but go ahead,

go off,

pop off King,

pop off.

I said dips.

I didn't say capitulation to,

to the complete downside.

I didn't say black Swan.

I didn't say,

uh,

an economic crisis.

I didn't say a crash.

I said de-risking and de-leveraging at these levels.

It doesn't happen nearly as much as it did 20 years ago

because there's other players in the game.

But pop off King,

pop off,

take what I say and twist it to whatever narrative it fits for you.

I respect it.

Got to get it when you can.

I'll put it this way.

Maybe I'm wrong,

but I would be pretty,

pretty willing to bet that the retail trader and investor since the,

since 2020 has had a much more,

significant impact on the decisions made by large institutions than it did

before.

I could be wrong.

I could be wrong,

but I'd be willing to bet that it's changed the game.

Now it's not some kid in his fucking parents' basements.

That's deciding everything,

but $5 billion a day from retail investing going in on dollar cost averaging

$5 billion a day from CTAs.

I would say that that probably is something that crosses that desk before

they decided to offload a full position.

Maybe I'm wrong.

So that's why I say,

when I look at things like tokens and whatnot you know,

it's something different,

it's something new and it's a way of evolving with the market.

So,

you know,

when I,

when I look at these,

you know,

I'm,

I'm,

I'm,

I'm interested to,

to come back to go offline and,

and look and see how I look at these companies that are offering the,

the,

their stocks as tokens or as digital,

you know,

digital stocks basically,

and look into that and see what there is.

Cause that might be something I'm actually interested in checking out because

that might be the future.

I don't,

I don't know.

I don't know.

Private companies may no longer feel the need to go public.

And while that's scary for,

for,

for people that are uninformed,

I think people that know what they're doing might have opportunities they

didn't before.

That guy got real quiet.

You know,

it's,

it's not what I said to him.

Wasn't fair.

Okay.

I think he was,

I think he was trying to make a point.

I think just the way he said it was kind of a dick way.

So I just responded.

I could have responded better if he would have said,

you really,

do you really think retail has that much?

Or do you think retail just,

you know,

whatever,

I'd have been like,

well,

maybe not like,

but he just goes thinking retail can stop.

A real dip is funny.

I didn't say anything about that.

I said,

it does go into decision-making right now.

And,

and,

and,

and,

and de-risking and de-leveraging at these levels would most likely happen

at a larger scale than it does now.

If it wasn't for the fact that trillions of new dollars,

unpredictable,

non-controlled dollars are in the market that weren't there before.

This is a hell of a Coinbase ad.

Oh,

we're done with the ad.

I'm just talking now.

My bad.

Shit.

I don't know.

You guys want to tool around with it and check it out.

Exclamation point base.

Appreciate Coinbase for,

for,

for sponsoring a segment and letting me have full control over this ad or

this spot or advertisement.

And not telling me what to say and saying,

Hey,

check it out.

If it's shit,

say it's shit.

If it's interesting,

say it's interesting.

You do what you want to do.

Appreciate that.

We've come a long way since 2021.

Is Monday just a dead cat bounce?

I don't know about a dead cat bounce.

I,

I did think it would probably gap up.

Um,

I was hoping for like one 65 today.

Um,

this market,

it's hard to say what would happen into tomorrow,

but I felt like,

as I told you guys,

you're in a call this morning.

Um,

you're,

uh,

what's your,

what's your final words on it?

I don't have final words on it yet.

Retail fuels trends,

but,

uh,

retail liquidity gets used to reverse trends.

Oh,

I agree with you.

I'm just saying that my point was,

is that the market has evolved.

I'm thinking that the market trades or,

or,

or reacts the same,

way it did 20 years ago,

as opposed to today,

we'll leave people in the dust more.

So I was referring to all the people that are calling this the biggest

bubble and it's a bubble.

It's about to burst.

It's a bubble.

You're right.

It's a bubble,

but bubbles can keep growing.

And the people who yell about a bubble,

the loudest are the ones on the sideline is what I was getting at.

And that if I were to trade or invest in the market,

the way it was 20 years ago,

I wouldn't be in the market,

but because I'm evolving with the way the market just is,

it's,

it's irrational.

It's crazy.

It's,

it's,

it's,

it's un unprecedented,

but it is what it is.

And I can either live in the past or I could just go with it.

You know what I mean?

That's,

that was the whole point I was making.

Drake here just resubbed for 19 months.

Oh shit.

I'm late.

I got to check on Bayo,

man.

I got to,

I might have to take him to the vet.

I'm really worried that,

that he's getting worse.

Hey,

he's puked up everything for the past two days and he's not,

he's not even able to go to the bathroom.

Now it's all liquid to the big gang.

He's on that,

that chop thing.

So he's on the,

the second thing of chemo and I'm really hoping it's just him reacting to the chemo and not

something else.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Good boy.

Oh,

you want a treat?

You want to go take?

You want to go for a walk?

You want to go to the park?

You want a treat?

Yeah.

Come here.

Let me get you a treat.

I need you to eat something,

buddy boy.

Hey,

look,

he's trained.

Shake.

Uh huh.

Speak.

Hi there.

Oh,

yeah,

Jacob boy.

You going to hold that down?

Oh,

good boy.

Good boy.

Happy.

Okay.

Good boy.

Oh,

man.

Oh,

man.

Good boy.

We're both getting great.

Oh,

good boy.

Oh,

good boy.

You want to play?

Okay,

let's play.

Let's play.

Let's get our treatment.

Play.

Okay.

Oh,

yeah.

Good boy.

Oh,

Jacob boy.

Oh,

Jacob boy.

Oh,

good boy.

I got you.

Come here.

Oh,

Jacob boy.

Oh,

good boy.

Oh,

good boy.

Sub to me.

Give me your sub money.

I'll call you a good boy.

Give me your good boy.

Oh,

you want me to rub your belly?

Oh,

here you go.

Oh,

your big scratches.

Oh,

your big scratches.

Oh,

that's the spot.

Oh,

yeah.

Good boy.

Good boy.

Oh,

I genuinely cannot believe this is what I unpause the stream to.

What,

a streamer treating his dog nice?

I'm just,

I'm fucking around.

Let's not get caught up in any fucking drama.

That's your standard eagle interaction with her chat?

Who's chat?

I'm getting that pit in my stomach again.

I don't like that he's,

he's this bad.

All right,

well,

we killed it today.

Good shit.

Packers or Eagles tonight?

I haven't watched either one of them this year.

Packers.

I have no idea.

El underscore Delgado just resubbed for 23 months.

Oh,

okay.

Now,

I only,

I only speak to people that sub,

like that,

people that sub to me.

I,

I gotta,

I gotta remind them they're good boys or whatever.

Okay,

let's get out of here.

I gotta go.

I gotta,

I really have to leave.

Um,

Hey,

Grant,

what brokerage you prefer for longterm stuff?

It shouldn't matter for longterm stuff.

Longterm stuff is,

is,

is really not that important.

Um,

you know,

obviously don't do some shady fucking,

you know,

LLC that's based in like,

I don't know,

fucking,

uh,

longterm shit,

but,

um,

you know,

like,

uh,

when it comes to longterm shit,

it really doesn't matter.

Obviously user interface is most important thing.

As long as they don't pay,

I don't think anybody charges commissions now.

All right.

Somebody give me somebody to rate.

Let's go.

Yeah.

I like Vanguard.

I even like,

I hate to say it,

but I still like Robinhood for longterm stuff because you get your IRA with the match and

the bonus,

you get a high yield savings account and you get the credit card.

If you get the thing and it like,

kind of like as a circle,

like a thing where you could just like put money in,

grow it and then use it.

And then,

you know,

you can transfer and fill up your IRA from money that's growing.

Plus you have a cashback credit card.

Um,

Vanguard I love because they offer a high yield savings account as well.

But I mean,

there's a lot though.

I'm not,

um,

I'm not,

um,

I'm not,

uh,

sponsored by any.

I just tell you what I think.

Right.

Somebody with a good boy tag.

I don't think anybody has a good boy tag.

There's a lot of people with a good boy tag.

Okay.

That's just weird.

What's your biggest holding longterm?

VU?

Individual stocks.

Um,

Google,

uh,

for,

for stocks.

Oh,

realty income.

Why is everybody with the good boy tag a fucking,

um,

dog avatar,

dog walk.

Why is your wife mad at you?

She's not mad at me.

She's just not doing really well right now because of Bayo.

And I understand.

Okay.

This guy's name is walkie rip.

I don't know if that means grip.

I said that the other day too.

I said,

I bet she got,

she,

I said,

nevermind.

I said,

I said,

I bet she,

she's a milkshake.

And I'm not,

I'm not proud of the things I say.

Okay.

Um,

anybody else got a stream where we could read what's your biggest fear in life?

I don't know,

man.

It's changes.

I've gotten older.

It's a good question.

I'd have to think about that now.

I'm not worried about being alone.

I'm not worried about failing.

My biggest fear in life is fucking up my life or my family's life with something that's

avoidable.

Getting back into addictions.

You know,

um,

trying to be a tough guy when I don't need to be.

And,

you know,

I feel like my biggest fear is that,

but,

but like,

I don't,

that's not failure.

No failure would be,

I'm afraid to try new things or do new things or whatever.

Cause I'm afraid to fail.

I've failed more times in my life by a,

by a 10 times,

a hundred times more times have I failed in my life than I succeeded.

I learned from my failures,

but I think I fear,

I fear,

like,

I don't know.

I really don't know how to answer that right now.

Um,

I,

I,

I,

I,

I,

I,

I don't know how to answer that right now.

You know what?

My dick not working.

That's my biggest fear in life is for some reason my dick stops working.

If I'm being real with you.

Cause I,

I could still get one off if I'm a crack head.

You know what I mean?

But like,

I don't care how much money you have.

If your dick doesn't work,

is it,

is it worth it?

I don't know.

And I don't want to think about it or get cut off.

Well,

it wouldn't work if it was cut off.

Okay.

I really have to go.

I have to go out to check on them.

They are,

give me somebody guys.

Just give me somebody.

Very Jake and bake live

Um, I do like rating really small streamers, but I think we've rated him before and I want to do it to somebody somebody new
