of the channel it's an old friend of the channel and uh we um we played it back for a while and

it went two thousand percent it was

all good and great and then uh it's had a lot of news since then they got a nasa contract today so

i'm hoping that it gets them a little bit there um we took pepsi through earnings we took nne at

end of day yesterday so we got a lot going on clarna have a nice little morning all right

ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong good morning ladies gentlemen boys girls let's see

how we are let me go get my stop losses in on serve mnts and polestar uh where are we at here

okay all right so uh let's go ahead and uh put our stop losses

in mltx moving a little today that's nice all right so polestar uh let's go ahead and put a uh

six percent trailing stop loss on it if i'm allowed to automatically goes to one percent

again this is insane i guess we're gonna have to do it by dollar amount time to do some maths

getting these in all right clarna having a nice little pop this morning out of nowhere

i didn't see what the news was but uh got us up 25 percent so we're gonna go ahead and uh

start legging out of those uh polestar so we're waiting for mnts serve kind of big

pop there i didn't get my stop loss in in time so i'm gonna have to hope that that goes hyft still

going and spy starting to push right there did i hold crm of course i did i'm probably gonna

regret that uh what do we got moving this morning so far we got uh imrx accidentally bought some

more yesterday kodak had a nice one here all right so mrx we're gonna go ahead and start

legging out of these two all right looking pretty nice there hopefully serve gets a little bit more

waiting for mnts polestar actually green funny enough let's go ahead look at our equity side here

uh we've got uh nvx up 15 percent this morning so let's go ahead and uh put a stop loss on the

shares we bought yesterday and then he's up hive now at 668 mlx depro back to 12 next having a nice

little day this morning um let's see what else we got moving this morning uh we've got uh mnts uh

we're in now serve we're in depro seven percent now mltx four percent six percent on gpus you you

got a lot of news um uh this morning and yesterday nuclear is everywhere right now

uh next we got the dip yesterday's doing well hive 675 now uh guts is up uh we got stss up a little

bit uh i entered poet finally i wasn't gonna do it until it came across my main news channel and

i'm like okay this is the cycle where uh uh exit liquidity is born yeah nvx is the is the is the is

the star today okay this isn't the music i'm used to are we buying the music i'm used to are we buying

poet well i didn't want to buy poet because it's a wall street bets kind of uh thing right now where

they're all talking about it and generally you know i wouldn't do it because of all the um

dilution that's happened from open door in there but it came across the news cycle and when it

comes across the news cycle that's when i uh that's what are you still in vcig no no no um

tos won't let me trade it anymore i had to close it out yesterday pepsi call is barely up iv crush

is kind of bad all right serve starting to bounce back a little bit hyft hasn't gone yet and uh and

pole star is still there how's mltx doing let's see now i have a few of the vcig shares left over

but like i can't add to i can't trade it anymore so it's just a closeout position um mltx uh we

averaged up but we're still up 39 on it d pro 1205 nice try to look at everything i got so much

moving right now pole star is probably going to do what it did last time i i like serve today i

do it i still think mnts is is the sleeper i think it's going to have a spike later today i'm not

like putting all my chips on it but i uh i i it's it's it's we've traded it like this before i mean

this is the one that we got into back when it was like 30 cents or whatever and then we watched it

go 2 000 did you get more n e yesterday i also took calls yesterday which i'm probably gonna

get wrecked on um plug gonna go again well plug is in the new meme etf and that's scary i'm gonna be

honest with you that's actually kind of scary and that's because the last time they had the um

the last time they had the uh uh what do you call it the uh the the meme etf launch was the top of

the market in 2021. i'm not saying that that's gonna happen again but i'm saying you know history

doesn't always repeat itself but it does uh it does look familiar often what about poet calls

you're gonna overpay for poet calls you're absolutely gonna overpay for them that's up to you

you know i mean it's up to you if you want to do that but um

you know your iv on that is going to be absolutely wild and uh i i i

wouldn't recommend it but again you know who knows what's gonna happen nvx 22 now by the way

did you get out paying yesterday yeah thank you for d-pro months ago okay

all right there we go on serve nice didn't average down i had another buy order at 14.55 it didn't

get down that low uh but i'm gonna go ahead and put my stop loss on this at four percent i know

it's a or sorry five percent i know it's a little bit uh uh volatile right now but uh if if i can

even load it okay yeah it loaded five percent all right there we go let's see if this gets another

pop right here this is the deal with uh

doordash uh for la for the the um oh hyft still going iv might be high but staying high i mean

yeah i mean you're you're you're you know you're you're you're asking for i don't say you're asking

for trouble but um you know that's uh that's a tall order normally i don't trade those unless

i see it hit the news cycle and that's when i see the the liquidity um uh part of the cycle

and that's what i'm gonna be that's what i'm playing on i'm just doing shares though all

right i don't know what happened to clarna but i'm glad it happened

uh we're at 50 now so uh i'm gonna sell all but one of them oh there goes serve all right i was

waiting for that one it took a minute it took a minute i'm kind of sad that it didn't get uh

didn't get bought on the average down there yo serge thank you for giving a sub to banging

the orangutan banging orangutan all right uh our fly calls i don't know how we got

bailed out on this i swear to god we were at two hundred and fifty five percent good morning i've

been on my commute for the last few weeks it's gone by just a little faster hey man thanks

that rocket explosion almost doomed us but here we are 260 percent now is it too late to get into

uu i don't think so i know that sounds crazy considering how much we're up we're up almost

300 there wow hyft is really flying um i i i know that you know it's it's it seems like it's really

high right now but the amount of news that's coming out the amount of talk and chatter about it

um is oh my god d-pro's going nuts let's go serve is going nuts too let's go d-pro

how much are we up on d-pro this so this is our third run our first one was 137 percent

100 second one we're up 170 percent on this one uh next having a good day mltx is back

nvx 30 today guys if you all remember the reason we got into nvx earlier this year

or whatever was because of that big doe contract they had for graphite um in tennessee for the plan

and uh uh we all became graphite barons or whatever and now with china and their export

uh restrictions are rolling out right now um nvx is potentially going to be a big winner in that

and there's also chatter that it might end up having a uh uh um stake from the government

but nvx is up 30 d-pro is up uu up another 10 we are at 20 dollars uh on uuu guys if you don't

remember we were buying you you back when it was five dollars four dollars back a couple years ago

absolutely insane run i think we nailed uh uh uranium and nuclear ahead of uh everybody else

that felt kind of good because we got in way before all this run happened um so that's really

nice uh serve on the day trade is doing really nice waiting for mnts d-pro going ape now

going ape i once had 2 000 shares of nvx when it was a dollar 20. now i only have 400 but

that's okay all right d-pro 175 percent up on it now nvx uh we're up uh 75 percent this run uh ml

tx 40 up on it now overall next looking pretty good today uh serve starting to go a little bit

more okay we nailed that one let's see what else we got moving car 7d zero g just resubbed for five

months what are your thoughts on cyber security stocks i think cyber security stocks are the most

undervalued sector in the entire stock market people just don't value people just don't get

that this is this is the next world war or potential world war or next cold war you're going

to be over cyber security all right let's see we get out of fly here all right i'm at a little bit

more mnts here wow d-pro 15 what lord god have mercy almighty let's go all right clarna big jump

today um fly doing really nice kodak doing really nice for some reason oh i remember buying

this nice which one d-pro or nvx okay got some powder on the sidelines here all right serve still

going waiting for mnts here d-pro having a hell of a day uh just i don't know what to do here

i'm gonna sell early like always because that's that's just who i am that's just who i

am i can't help it hoping nbx gets a pop today a lot of they had they had news as well uh the

illinois that they're gonna be uh putting 12 million dollars towards a uh new um a new uh

uh facility in illinois and they're getting the uh the uh uh governor as well also ladies and

gentlemen i hate to say it but i am going to let my ebs leaps go okay saki i have one serve one

dollar one data to to expiration 15.5 call i have up 225 okay okay you don't hang out in the in

the discord in the morning waiting for some name and then just take zero day or one day options

on it that's how you wreck an entire account all right uh i'm gonna sell the last of my ebs leaps

the seven dollar leaps for twenty twenty seven at seventy percent i'm gonna regret this

i'm gonna regret this you know what no i'm gonna hold it why not i got nothing to lose also saved

on amazon yesterday that big pop yesterday we were able to get out of all of it ended up going from

being down on those to up that was nice all right serve still going got stopped out of hyft so at

least we've got some capital there that was a great play this morning this was off of their

buyback 2.3 million shares they're buying back which is about five percent of their float

depot's still holding up pretty well just wait on mnts i i i think i i

know it sounds crazy but i think that's the one today that's not a good mindset to have but still

i think that's the one all right mltx doing really well today nine percent depro thirteen percent

uh we got serve is starting to move again uh joby actually having a nice little one here

gpus had more news this morning tssi still doing pretty well and there goes serve 20 let's go wait

spies down but everything we're in is green

loss is in i guess all right klar still moving why is spy moving with gold now instead of inversing it

because people aren't diversifying they're just putting it in everything you're up 330 on your

serve call okay bro you need to chill kind of weird we ride rivian plug all red oh those aren't

things that we're playing today i mean we own them but we're not playing them right now do you own

any gold bro can you not be toxic this morning can you know it's just too early can you give

me 10 minutes before you start with the toxicity or are you like legitimately asking

out of fly leaves for 30 thanks to the signal as always not not a signal

legit asking uh you mean physical gold no i bought uh junior miners go we bought jnug back in march

or whatever we're up about full all 360 on that uh also guys depro now 13 we did it we did it look

how many times we've played this remember when we played it here and made a hundred and something

percent in a week and then they had did earnings and then we played it all the way up here

and then we started buying on the way down and then started selling the way up look at this from our

own depro and the whole reason we got into depro was because of the russia ukraine thing but now

depro is up 600 since we got in if you're still holding we we we've we've we've done pretty well

this past year on uh on getting in before or trying to you're trying to shock me or something

from the bed to the tv kaya will be free what what the are you guys talking about

what is kaya this is some degenerate ass is this the hassan you guys were talking about yesterday

hassan used a shock collar on his dog and is denying it what does that have to do with anything

we're doing here stop acting like you're not up to date on every lsf news for 15 months

no i i i don't live on lsf the only time i go on lsf generally is if i'm uh is if if one of my

clips get on there i don't spend a lot of time on there since you're impartial can you take a

look at the clip and tell us what you think what what what is what does that have to do

with the stock market today you guys trying to rope me into some bullshit

it's connected to twitch so it's a lot of shit we want beef no do i dca into aehr

you have a dog you should care okay first off my dog has to do with someone else's dog whatever

the fuck this has to do is is not has nothing to do with me and i don't know what the fuck you guys

are talking about i'm shocked you don't know about it okay bro that's just okay d pro 1320

now um serve still going um and uh we've got uh what's the other one that we were looking at here

uh our biggest movers today we've got nvx what a fucking play i mean we look at this look at this

i mean we we we got into nvx ham solo remember this if a stock at this point in time is 98

down during this bull run it ain't a play just being honest chat can glaze all day i don't care

that was right here i'm sorry bro i know it i know i know i'm not i'm not conventional but

you know but i'm glad that we're we're here i mean what a fucking what a fucking turnaround

this has been so far just figured you would have a take on it since you've been very vocal about

not hitting your kids to discipline them bro y'all okay i'm moving on from this shit i don't know

what the fuck's going on here i i don't want to i don't i don't i don't want to get involved in

some shit that i don't i'm not you know i don't have information on that has nothing to do with

me gpus down 8.25 buy buy the dip buy the dip buy the dip this is financial advice i'm kidding

didn't you said didn't you sell all of it true all right i'll go i'll go with you tesla queen

be careful though they could go all the way back down to 39 again um are you averaging down on

rivian and tilray still well tilray was such a small position so uh i said fuck it and i bought

a couple more of the contracts today as far as um rivian yeah i added some rivian yesterday

i had my rivian um my rivian leaps yesterday uh all right so i'm glad we got out of clarna earlier

we've got uh big move on fly is doing pretty well again ebs is going nuts uh mirror is kind of up

and down right now and then we've got uh crm from yesterday we bought we bought those yesterday and

we caught the exact bottom i'm up 15 on two calls i think i'm gonna sell one and let the other one

ride because i think that

i think that the the catalyst that we bought with yesterday is not something that might carry over

too long if it does i'll have one but i really don't like to to do that i really don't like to

do that what was your n and e play so we were buying the end of day yesterday and we we didn't

get we could we started at the wrong time so uh i bought yesterday um not really a yolo it kind of

is because it's it's a little bit short dated don't tell anybody but uh i got into this yesterday

and it's uh i'm just looking for a scalp here i bought a bunch of shares uh we bought shares

at 50 we sold at 57 two days ago bought back at 51 40 was it 51 49 and 47 20 um and so now i'm just

selling on the way up thanks for you you yesterday all-time high today even more news today on you

you it just it's it's i'm telling you i don't know what's going on but we've got ourselves some uh

some uh uh you know god damn d pro uh more news i put it in stocky's daily news i mean

you you you is now being considered the only

legitimate um rare earth mineral uh you know company to be able to to turn those around and

process them uh in the u.s everybody thought it was mp and it wasn't it was you you all along and

now with china curbing more exports on that it looks like more u.s um you know uh you know rare

earth metals wherever they get them from are going to be processed on the u.s side and it looks like

you you you is the only one set up currently to be able to do it at scale and uh others can but

not at the same scale and so it looks like uh it looks like the

just another bonus for what we were in pedophile would be accurate though what the fuck what did

you just call me first time chatter are you good bro i was not talking to you you didn't tag anybody

you literally came in first time chat and just wrote that like you weren't responding to anybody

you good bro is it you you you or you you oh it's you you you you something we've been in for years

shares or calls on mnts ain't no way i'm taking calls on that did everyone poop today

oh shit rnn e-calls wait what i was a little bit scared for a second there i will learn nothing

from this 40 all right i ain't sticking around to the i ain't sticking around on these i don't care

you can call me a paper-handed bitch all you want ain't no way i'm holding i'm holding these any

longer okay all right so nvx still going 25 serve what a hell of a play this morning

get a little bit scary out the gate but looking good um hyts or whatever hytf was a good one too

did did we get stopped by a guy who was a good one too did we get stopped by a guy who was a good one too

i guarantee i'm gonna make a take a loss on this one i always do are we buying gpus already did

uh bought 500 shares at 47 cents that's why when she said what i do i said full port that's what

i'm doing i'm not a smart man though all right we got anything else right now um god damn nvx

nna holy shit mltx 10 today depro 15 serve 22 next three percent uh uuu 12 percent um tssi

50 we're still early on that play i think are you still in rig no no one processes uh rare earth as

cheap as china dirt cheap uh 100 understood but that is completely separate than what we're talking

about here all right i got out of all but uh one we'll see what happens why are you still

fucking with gpus so gpus was the one that i got into that a lot of us including me thought this

this one might be one that probably doesn't work out like we really i even i don't know if it's

maybe i missed this one but i just kept holding it and then it ended up going nuts and we got

really lucky um it ended up spiking um what was it 400 500 percent and the whole reason that i got

into the first time was because they were paying down debt and uh it uh it was great and then this

morning we got that they've reduced their debt by another 30 million and it says that they're

going to have a 617 000 square foot michigan ai and bitcoin data center uh run by one of its

subsidiaries and uh the power capacity at the site is set at least they're planning for it to grow

from 30 megawatts to 70 megawatts by q2 of 2027 long-term plans obviously at 340 megawatts which

is insane i don't know where they're gonna get that they're gonna fucking have to suck up all

the power from a goddamn major city um and they also just ordered a thousand uh bitmain uh ant

miner as 21s uh and they're going to have to suck up all the power from a goddamn major city

uh so you know i don't know if this is going to be something that actually works for them or not

but um i'll give that a shot you know what i mean and so that's why a little while ago when it when

it hit uh 47 uh it actually it hit it hit 46 but i bought it 47 there what did i get in exactly at

uh 4768 so a little bit higher than that 4768 right there isn't gpus a scuff version of core

weave i mean that's not a

wrong assessment jesus fuck we're up pretty decent on a red day i love days like this

that was a very lucky play on um on uh nne coming out the gate uh or sorry uh end of day yesterday

into today got that last one out at 300 i think we're gonna we're gonna dip a little bit here but

nne had some big news this morning as well that's why we're kind of uh kind of bullish on it all

right serve kind of dip in here i think i'm about to get stopped out uh gpus let me go ahead and put

a stop loss uh of uh because we're already up about 10 so let me go ahead and put a stop loss

on that fuck we got a lot of shit up today

oh music sorry my bad i'm just waiting for mir to get get a little bit of love

all right stopped out of serve great fucking play today holy shit all right i gotta take the money

i have left over and do something stupid with it what's that gonna be jobi calls or microsoft calls

i forgot to say choose i said most likely ah it's a fucking dgen all right fine fine whatever you say

homie actually you know what i should do i should really not because i have i have to withdraw from

this account again before i do something else i'm gonna do something else i'm gonna do something else

stupid lord forgive me it is done trust the bot well i didn't ask them when is poet still a dgen

buy i'm just buying little bits of uh shares on it uh because we saw the whole um uh wall street

bets thing with poet and the concern with poet is that they're trying to they're trying to uh get it

to squeeze or whatever without understanding that open door people are still coping and so

it's going to be whenever you have

multiple here's the thing let me give you an example all right and this is something that

people come in all the time people are you know i'm an expert in the market i've been in since

gamestop and i know how this stuff works and you just don't get it stocky gamestop's gonna moass

the warrants are gonna make the moass happen this is an investable company because they have cash

that they're not spending amc you know you know it's not that i understand things more it's that

i'm i'm on the outside looking in i'm not like you know looking for confirmation bias a lot of

information bias because you have money invested or you're involved in something and you really

really want it to go right for you and so you're going to look at grasp at everything and look at

that as as whatever if you zoom out and look at the whole picture i do the same thing with my

stocks right if you for example gme and to an extent amc why did they squeeze back in 2021

right why did they squeeze because everybody in the fucking world was watching and buying

you have coalesced this entire population of people millions of people and poured all that

money into one thing simple supply and demand in a short-term time frame prices skyrocket

two things can happen one the company dilutes the shares right so if let's say there's just

for aesthetics there's a thousand shares of something and there's 10 000 people that want

to buy it right well if the first if a thousand if a thousand people have one share each and they

want to sell it but there's there's a thousand people that want to buy it and they want to sell it

nine thousand other people that want to buy it these guys can raise the price on it and it gets

bought up and then everybody who wants to get in has to do it drives the price up right but if you

dilute it and turn it into 10 000 shares well guess what now the value of each one isn't worth as much

there's more out there so it's not gonna there's you know people don't have to overpay for it so

it drops the price right dilution from the company the other is the squeeze nightmare now now gamestop

has diluted a million times amc has diluted so many times it's like it's like what in in you know

in medieval times

and back in the in those days you know you didn't drink water there wasn't water you only drank

alcohol because water had bacteria and diseases in it but they didn't know it because they have

microscopes and shit so they just knew that if they drank water they got sick and died so they're

like okay but if i drink beer and wine all that shit i don't die so i'm just gonna drink that

not realizing that's because of the boiling process that made it so even children drank beer

for breakfast lunch dinner all day in the fields

it just was diluted so much that it was very low alcohol but like everybody was fucking drunk back

then or you had a high everyone's alcoholic right and so this is an actual like you know a true story

okay um you know this is this is actually something that that happened right like i could get into a

whole thing about the food they ate which was fucking horrible and stuff like that um but yeah

so that was dilution right like you know if you had money you drank wine and if you you know you

were in with the church maybe you got a little bit of alcohol you know you got a little bit of alcohol

some meat or some shit like that but like you couldn't drink water because you'd fucking get

sick and die right well i'd go to the clean river no because animals shit in it people are you know

whatever there's fucking you know whatever so we're diluting the other is dilution of the people

so you can either dilute the shares or you can dilute the people how do you dilute the people

get the foam mowers or the ones who made money and tell them here's the next big opportunity

and that's when you get your um your your you know

kss and you get your um uh give me some of the names from back then what do you guys remember um

not kss um goss right goss uh what was the other one uh the weed the little weed stock what was it

oh yeah you got uh well bbby was later on um sundial there you go sundial um blackberry

cost that's the one i was thinking about cost okay and on and on and on and on and on okay nokia yeah

so now either dilution of shares or dilution of people so if you dilute the shares and the people

get diluted you kill the momentum and then people want to get out because they're up profitable so

they start getting out and then the people who are buying from them are bag holders forever and

they're the ones who sit back and stay on these these forums of it's gonna moass it's gonna be

just oh did you hear about this oh this is all because the the the the hedges are after us or

the failures to deliver this is illegal and these are the ones who sit back and stay on these these

they're gonna they're gonna have to do it and and then and even if you're right it's like okay that

is wrong and maybe they will have to but then the shares dilute it doesn't matter anymore but you

don't you believe every little piece of news not being a dick that's just that's just that's just

like under that's how this works right so with poet right now here's the problem bear case and

bull case i am starting a poet position you're late to the game other people got in when it was

seven dollars and stuff like that sure i don't get in just because people start talking about it

i'm gonna give you the bull case okay and i'm gonna give you the bear case all right all right

i'm gonna give you the bear case and the bull case bull case for me is that it's getting picked

up by regular news right now i posted the article today in stocky's daily news that retail traders

are buying okay i'm gonna show you another chart right now this is not a call to action i'm just

explaining my thought process on things jesus serve is still going

you

um i posted this in stocky's daily news today so i'll just show it to you here

oh fuck i didn't save it son of a bitch hold on maybe i should start being more prepared for

things but here you go ah here it is all right here you are this gives you an example here you

are sharewood news major news not major but major for stock talking about poet here's the call

volumes for poet daily call volumes averaging like 10 to 20 000 and then in one day 600 000

right so so they're talking about it now what does that mean that means that this is where

liquidity is created okay generally speaking whenever there's like a meme stock or or you

know a new retail darling or whatever there's a few cycles right and they have to hit correctly

for it to to move the right way but you have the initial people that buy and then the other people

that buy they're down then you have the initial people that buy and then the other people that buy

the first round of people talking about something and that's where it hits message boards

okay get a little spike comes back down then you get your retail hubs like wall street bets

right goes up comes back down then you get your news cycle okay we are here okay remember it

jumped onto wall street bets and now it's come down today this is supposed to be what i call

the liquidity phase there are obviously algos and computers and people that watch wall street

bets and other places like that to see if it's viable or not the option call exploding was all

good and great we're seeing the drop today but this is where people go this is where the real

people make money or the big money is put in if the cycle is is correct this is where okay on this

dip right here the news cycle dip this is where the money gets in wait for the dip wait for it

was going down put the money in now it's on the news cycle now real money's coming in now volumes

are starting to pick up then because of that the people that were here here here and here are

posting their gains okay they think they had it figured out this is what pushes it they post

their gains that after the liquidity cycle is what drives in the next group of people

that's when you get that sudden spike up and then you get that elation everyone is making money

and look at all these gay now and now more people are posting games everybody's oh shit i better get

on it oh it's going to 82 it's going to 100 it's going to whatever and that's when you get the

fucking kids in their car and they're like oh shit i better get on it and they're like oh shit

with $200 robin hood accounts fucking jumping in most of it's through derivatives like options

but that's where you get it and then you get the exit liquidity cycle and then from there sometimes

you get a rebound and that brings in more people before it eventually dies off and they all end up

looking like this go back to any chart that is a retail darling that's a shit chart go back to any

chart and they all look like that every one of them they all end up looking like that same thing

here right boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

whoop whoop whoop that's what they all look like and so we did that with open door right we caught

in we caught in around 131 around this cycle because that was the only one now this is the

bear case i'm talking about from this point i'm not talking about here because everything i sound

like makes it sound like now's the time to buy for a bull case no bear case the reason that open

door worked so well was because it was a standalone it was the only one remember how we started in the

beginning about the whole game stop and amc thing it was one fucking cycle everybody in the problem

is is that there's still open army people and a lot and because it bounced back up to nine dollar

range that still believe this is going to go to 82 or whatever that confirmation bias that i bought

the top or i got more i know this is going to work or i'm balls deep and i'm going to do this

because that one hasn't died yet there are less people

you

in the retail side to try to push the poet one than there were during the open door one

so that's the that's the problem right now so for those of you guys that want to jump in on

this poet thing like oh my god i missed open door here we go again i mean it may work but

you got to give yourself a bear a bear case scenario number one it's it's being pumped

because to be to pump it not because the legitimacy of the company number one and number

two it's diluted remember either the company dilutes or the or the or the uh the traders

or the money you know they dilute and right now there's dilution on traders as long as open door

is still being talked about and people are there they're not going to sell that or let that go

those people aren't going to move their money to poet so you have like a lot less people to put

money into it you see what i mean that's something you got to put in the back of your mind when you

want to jump on this doesn't mean it's not going to go back up right if we get to the point where

the liquidity cycle picks up and people start posting their gains we may see it but we may

see less gains or less amount of people doing it just because there's so many more people still in

something else and that's why i'm saying that's why i'm saying that's why i'm saying that's why i'm saying

else so i realize i'm just an idiot with a camera but this is one of that like stupid shit that goes

in my head every time i look at something and i think about something i put all those little

from years of doing this shit that's how i look at it like we did good with open door we got in

at like 131 and i think a lot of us sold between four and seven dollars of course it went all the

way up to nine and then when it went to 10 we shorted it and made a bunch of money too

but this is going to be a little bit different because these are the obstacles

right that we just broke down as the as the bear case okay

so i just wanted to put that out there for everybody because they're going to start seeing

more posts about poet stocky a hater he's big mad he's broke and missed the meme all right now don't

get me wrong i i have i i'm i'm in for you know i'm in for 50 shares right now okay uh and for an

average uh on poet of quick watch the ball boomer to the bear gang i'm in for 50 shares now and if

it runs then then i'll i'll make some money if it falls i'll add a little bit more you know i'm

going to see what it is i wouldn't be surprised if it falls i'll add a little bit more you know

but i think that we're in that cycle right now and so we saw the the the oh shit did we sell the

top there hey m a jensen are you still in your um are you still in your uh serve calls from this

morning no what is that smells like bitch sorry my that was toxic bro that's my bad that's that's

that's that's my bad you know i mean coming from the guy who always sells early yeah that's that

that's the irony of it

d pro long term like five years my thing is with something like that i'm not going to sell it uh

unless um unless i see something else in that sector or a reason to get out of that sector

it's like okay if i'm bullish on the sector and that i think is the best opportunity right now

then i'll stay but if i see somebody else catching up or picking up or doing something like that

then i will um i'll uh i'll change it and but

otherwise uh uh there's no real reason for me to do that all right how are we doing on gpus here

catalyst thanks for mltx tssi and mirror in the last week the only one i'm even on is stss

best signal service in the game mother you know what i'm not even gonna fucking acknowledge that

shit anymore all right fuck it you know what here you go you want you want you want you want

to see a stocky classic i do not know how the hell we timed the exact bottom yesterday on this

and the reason that we took it was for the dumbest reason that day maybe or that hour but

nah 30 i'm not gonna not take that i'm out for 6.9 bro who the fuck is this what is

or you've been following me since october 6 and you come in here with tentacle what

bro mods handle that motherfucker i i don't i don't even know what that means and i don't

this is outside of my i don't know earlier i got accused of picking on somebody because they didn't

respond to anybody or at anybody and they said they said some crazy outlandish shit so of course

i assumed it was to me and then they're like it wasn't me so you know what maybe i'm missing some

things y'all handle that saw your youtube very interested on your view on asts and why don't

much people talk about the stock asts has talked about a lot it's actually it's actually asts isn't

talked about as much because there's so many other companies now and everybody's trying to cycle

through each one asts yesterday we talked about and a lot of people here played it because yesterday

morning we talked about how verizon just signed that big deal with asts and they're spending all

that money that's why verizon fell and asts mooned i mean there's just a lot of there's a lot of

you know companies within that sector and i think everybody's just trying to find out which one is

going to be like the the one to rule them all everybody wants to get in and like there's so

you know up and down so you know why why do not more people talk about it i mean people do talk

about it it's just you have to go to places where people focus on that sector because there are

thousands and thousands of companies and stocks and i talk mostly about the ones that i am

personally invested in because it's what i watch and ones that i follow on the news and and whatever

day. You know what? I'll be honest with you for the past five days. Well, probably for the past

five years, almost everything I traded in the morning that I got into was something I had never

heard of five minutes before I bought it. Like, you know, but I got it on some catalyst or some

news. Like there's just that many companies out there. Um, for example, I'm, I've been heavily

invested in guilt, uh, GIT, Galit satellites, and they have a massive backlog and I've been

buying them for a year now. And it's, it's, you know, and I'm watching these other ones go do,

do, do, do, do, do. And I'm just like, all right, let me just stay to steady the road,

you know? Um, and it's worked out pretty well so far. You know, I mean, if you're trying to

trade it and make a little time, it and make a little pops and drops, then it's different.

But if you're looking to invest, you try to look at things like that. I'm not talking about ASTS,

but I like that specific stock. So there's going to be different. I carry so much guilt. I make

Catholics and Jewish people, uh, look carefree. I said a few months ago, if you have more equity

in your home than you do in guilt, you're doing it wrong. What's your take on quantum computing

trading at 1000 times?

Revenue in this bubble. If people are willing to buy it, then that's what people are willing

to buy.

My keys and two just resubbed for two months. Take on air to please. Is this real company?

Again, everybody's going to ask about this bubble. Is it overvalued? I mean,

here's the problem with talking about value overvalued compared to what? Well, it's trading

it this times it's PE ratio. And that's insane historically. Yeah, but we weren't, this is a

different market now.

You know what I mean? Like people aren't trading off of fundamentals and trading off of investing

off of a balance sheets and TA anymore. It's just a vibe market. I mean, will it cool off? Sure. But

how high does it go before it cools off? You know? Um, the question is, is you're asking me stocky.

Do you think I should sell stocky? Do you think it's going to, the bubble's going to burst if it

does? Hey, guess what? It'll get bought right the fuck back up. You know what I mean? Like it's

just, it's just, that's the market we're in.

That's why if you don't like it, just did total fucking market funds. I'm the type of person who,

Hey, listen, historically, we are in a very fucking dangerous spot market wise, right?

If you look at history, gold is at all time high and has been spiking, right? You got, you got,

you got debt at an all time high. You've got, you know, there's just, there's so much economic

uncertainty there. There's, there's all this shit going on right now. Bond markets fucked.

And so historically you would have already pulled your money out of the stock market, right?

Or you would have hedged completely. But everybody who's done that has missed the boat. Well,

it'll happen eventually. Oh, look in April, it fell. Yeah, that's finally bought up in three

months. No, one month. It's just a different market. It's a different world. And there's

just more people and more money flowing into it. And even if you have a 50% correction,

you know what I mean? Or 30% correction. If you're up a hundred percent before the correction

happens and then it, but then it goes back up, you're fucking sitting pretty. You know what I

mean? There's so many people out there from in April.

Like I said, that, that, that thought we were stupid. Ooh, the market's done. Trump's destroyed

this. The market's crashed. Get out of the market. And we're like, all right, cool. And we bought.

And like, they're all like, fuck, well, this doesn't go to, this isn't sustainable. It'll

fall again. And it's like, okay, but we're up 35% since then. So even if we have a 20% correction,

we're still up and you're going to be, even if you buy, then you're still down compared to what

you would have been. Like, it's just a different market. It's good. The bubble's going to burst

eventually. Yes. But when is it going to happen? Do you sit on the sidelines for 10 years waiting

for it to happen?

Five years, two years, three years. And when it does burst, how, how far does it go? And

how long does it last? You know what I mean? Like I'm hedging, but I'm not putting my money

in some, you know, whatever I'm my, my way of hedging is putting shit in solid defensive

stocks that, um, that have good dividends. So for example, when I have a good trade or

a good week and I have profit, I buy a couple of shares of yesterday. I bought two shares

of, Oh, when it went under 60 bucks, I bought two shares of VTR and two shares of MO. I'm

not giving up my X.

Equity for that. I'm taking prop. Am I literally watching CRM right now? We'll do this. The

problem is, is that everybody wants to, everybody wants to, because it's the only way you can

is focus on what happened in the past and say, well, historically this happened. Therefore

it's going to happen again. You know what I mean? And it's not history. I mean, I already

said people who short the market have lost more money, significantly more money.

Yeah.

Than anyone else in stock market history. And when you talk about when you, yeah, but

what about Michael Burry? You can name one guy, millions and millions of people that

have traded and invested. You can name one guy who did it successfully. Speaking of Burry,

the market is up 83% or some shit since he said to sell everything. His last tweet. Actually,

I don't even know what it is now. Hold on. What is it? I'm not even shit on Michael Burry.

I'm just saying people use him as the example. What was it? Let me see. Um, January 31st,

2023. Sell.

Literal bottom. And I'm not shitting on Michael Burry. I'm just saying he's the one people

invoke each time. Wow. That GPS buy was great. All right. I'm gonna be my last buy in MNTS

today. I'm gonna start putting my stop loss in. I was lagging in. So I got, I got the

capital to do this here. So yeah. So, so again, you're, you're looking at your, you know,

and it's not your fault. There's, there's just no other way. It was kind of like during

the tariff thing in April. So many people online was like, you don't know what you're

talking about. This is the, this is it. Cause you, the last time we did this with tariffs

was the Holly act and it destroyed everything. I'm like, I get that you're using that as

the historical context, but the world and the economy and the interconnected global

marketplace was in the 1920 versus 2025. What? Like, like that, that it was just such a bad,

it was like, it's not a bad faith argument. Cause I feel like a lot of people really just

didn't understand, but there were a lot of people, even content creators who don't cover

the economy. I saw it. I saw content creators that, that, that, that, that cover politics,

but don't cover, uh, you know, uh, economic.

Misunderstanding and saying, Oh, well, this is like the Holly act. I'm like, no, it's not

like that. We had one trading partner and everything was done by fucking 30 days on a

fucking ship back then. You know what I mean? Like, it's just a different world. We changed

fucking derivatives and futures. Now you can trade fucking soybeans and on the fucking

futures market, you don't have to send it and put it back. It changes in different times.

And on top of that, it's, it was a different world. Money worked differently. Timing worked

differently. So it's just like, you know, I get why. I mean, I'll give you an example.

Um, it used to be that every single recession was preceded by a 10, a 10 year, two year,

a yield curve inversion, right? The yield curve was inverted for like three years now,

except for like one day. So people have just given up on that too. So again, things change.

It doesn't mean that we're not going to fall, but it's just a different world now.

Do you think you could automate what you're doing streaming? Fuck. I wish I'm thinking about getting

one of those programs that turned me into a big titty goth girl. I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't

have said that out loud.

Keep your face and I'm sold. Okay. That's just weird. All right. We were smart getting out of

Klarna earlier and any earlier EHR. Uh, I'm going to have to wait on now. Um, serve still running.

Yeah. Yeah, I know you're out of any, no, no, no, no. Just the calls that we took at end of day

yesterday. Like we were all way the fuck over leveraged yesterday. Um, because we started

buying N and E calls as our YOLO. Well, Tina asked for a YOLO for the weekend cause she's traveling.

So I said,

N and E calls. So like a bunch of us jumped into N and E calls. And then like 20 minutes later,

it just like fucking had like a, a, a 1% down candle. And I was like, Oh shit. So we bought a

little bit more than it spiked. Then it dropped again. I was like, Oh shit, we were pretty balls

deep. And so this morning when it popped 30%, I'm like, Oh shit, I got it. That worked out.

You're right. I'm just asking what time y'all going again. That when you're picking her up or

is that when you're leaving? Okay. This is my fault that you're this tired. I mean, I mean,

we weren't complaining.

When I went all 50 shades of gray on your ass yesterday, but like that was early though. But

still, it probably, I mean, I don't know. Why are you so tired today then? Cause you didn't sleep

last night. Why not? Well, that's cause you guys went to the temple. Oh, cause you were on Amazon

for prime day all night. Oh, that's why you bought shit for a hundred bucks. It wasn't about that.

You bought a hundred dollars worth of shit for no reason that we don't need it because we're moving.

It's that you were up all night on that. Now you're sleepy today, which now takes out of my

chance of, of, of, you know, I mean, probably not.

You're still horny. Well, that's because yesterday was kind of wild. You know what? Let's just not,

let's talk about this later. What do you mean? So stupid because the kids took my deodorant and I

had to use yours. Oh, Oh, we want to talk about what, let me tell y'all a little story. Okay.

Okay. Let me tell y'all a little story. And you know, I'm gonna wait till she's gone to tell this

story. Cause, cause, cause she ain't going to like me telling this story about something she

did. She gonna feel embarrassed. I'm so tired, but I look nice. See, if I said that, I didn't

even say I look nice. I said something about like, uh,

about how my content's gotten better. And these motherfuckers said, I self-glazed listen to me as

like a Trump conference. Like I'm a, but you say it and they're like, slay queen. You look great.

Like you, what the fuck? You just said, when you look tired, you're not supposed to look good,

but somehow I do. I always think you're hot until I get PNC. No, these guys are ruthless. Let me

tell you, let me, let me show you something, babe. Okay. Yesterday there was a video of me.

Okay. There was a video of me. All right. And it was,

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

from three years ago. And I was looking at it and you know, I looked kind of young and let me show

you what my chat said to me. Okay. Let me just tell you what my community said to me in that

moment. Okay. This is what was said to me. Okay. Here we go. Damn. I thought only Asian women fall

off that hard. Is that your son? Okay. Actually, let me show you the first picture first. You have

to go. I'm sorry to hear that. No, this was the first thing. Okay. So this was the picture. This

was happening on stream. Okay. So it was this picture of me versus an older one become a

streamer. They said, it'll be fun. Okay. Damn. I thought only Asian women fell off that hard.

Is that your son? Man is going to show up shaved with a backward hat tomorrow. Watch. Okay. This

is just the beginning. Hold on. LMAO. Now, if you just do whatever you're doing in reverse,

you'll look great. Okay. Stop trading before you look like this guys.

It's like a before and after of one of those drug mug shots. You used to be so full of life. What

happened? My mod said, bro drank from the wrong Holy grail. How did your head get longer aging at

the speed of light weight? You stream with your grandson. Wake up call. I'm done trading. Looks

like wisdom to me. Trump looks younger than you. Does your daughter ever ask what happened to her

old dad? Biden aged better.

Even AI can't age you like that. You lost weight, but in a bad way. This is why we're

declaring war on drugs. Your eyes are moving further apart as you get older. They said the

gray hair was transitory aware. You might as well start drinking again. Clark Kent to Clark Fent.

You looked happier. Maybe it's just the lighting copium from captain America to crack in America.

Don't talk.

To me or my son again. Are you on the AARP hall of fame? What happened to your eyebrows?

You look like someone who would play league of legends. You look like a Genshin impact enjoyer.

I've never played that satellite mapping that hair loss hairline loss over time.

Kay Kona. Maybe the vaccines are killing us. You must have cosplayed the daughter in interstellar.

Nice. I just joined. Is this an aging filter IRL?

Followed by the last comment before I just stopped looking, which says who cut your hair, bro? He should

be jailed. I didn't catch the rest of them. Oh, that makes me sick. You know, right when I'm like,

you know what? I'm going to be responsible. I'm going to sell my CRM call. I'm going to sell my

CRM. I'm going to be responsible. I'm responsible. Who doesn't take 30% in two days? Who doesn't do

that? I'm just on my fucking high horse today. I'm just going to take my, my CRM call money at six.

$690 and watch it go to 740 because that's what I do. Oh, speaking of which that reminds me,

I got to tell you all what happened yesterday. I'm so fucking, I'm so pissed. I'm so pissed.

What happened with the house? Oh, we're still going. I booked our flights and my wife will be

happy because we're going to, we got layovers. We got a layover in Phoenix. We just enjoy the

airport and just the two of us, no kids. And we'll get a coffee and a drink. It'd be like a little

date. Phoenix. Isn't that bad of an airport? It'll be. What is this? That's your fucking basic white

girl. Weird fucking bullshit.

Oh, this. Oh, what? What is that stain on your dress? It's me. What do you mean?

Wait, hold up. Wait, babe. Just take the baking soda that I have over there.

Get it in the sink. But I don't know what the stain is. It probably something from one of your

kids. It may not even be for me. I don't think we've been, I love you, babe. Really? You wear

that and we don't. I mean, that's a nightie. You're going to wear that to the mall. That's not a nightie.

Close out of position now. So I'm done playing that. Why is your L counter pie? Oh,

that's from yesterday. Oh, she's in the shower. I got to tell you what happened yesterday. All

right. Let me tell you what happened. So last night, yesterday, my wife goes, I think I'm

going to take my parents and the kids to the temple tonight. I was like, oh, really? Yeah.

I was like, what time? She goes, we leave at about seven. We'll come back around 10. I was

like, three hours of shit. She's like, what are you going to do? I was like, well, fuck it. I

think I'm probably going to go play cards. You know, I go, I like to, you know, go to the,

to the casino and play cards every now and then. And she's like, okay, whatever. I said,

just let me know when you're going to be back. So it takes them forever to get out of the

house. They finally get out of down to two and a half hours. I go, they leave. I go to get my

wallet, my wallets in the car. So I did what any normal human would be. I dipped into the sex jar

and I grabbed some money and I went and I found a new game. I really liked,

I was kind of getting beat up on the Mississippi stud, but I'd never played a double draw poker.

And I love it. It was a lot of fun. Cause you get to like create hands and stuff and you're

not playing against the house. So I was playing and I did pretty well. And

I got to a hand where I, I wanted to double up on a position, but I needed to add a few,

few bucks to it. Cause I don't, it was a guaranteed winner. So I wanted to add some money to it.

I couldn't, you know, whatever, whatever played the hand. It actually won some money left. You

know, I left up, I left up, I got home, wife's home, kids are home, put the kids to sleep.

And I said to my wife, she goes, how did you do? Or how'd you do? Cause she hates when I win.

Cause she wants me to lose. So I won't go back. I said, how'd you do? I said, she's you have fun.

I said, well, am I a bad person? If I say,

did have fun, you know, it was nice to get out of the house and do something.

It's like, did you make any money? I said, yeah, I made a few bucks. I said,

but I couldn't really play with real money because my wallet was in the car

and I couldn't find the chips. Oh no, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. I said, because I don't have any

money. She said, but did you win any money? And I said, yeah. I said, I walked out with,

you know, a couple hundred bucks. She goes, those things are money. I go, what? She goes,

those, those, those, those, those are money. I said, yes. I said, they're chips that represent

money. She goes, oh, I said, what? She said, you had a bunch of them over in that little drawer by

the, by the, by the sink in, in, in the, in the bath and in the bedroom. I said, yes. She goes,

I thought those were, were like toys or something that the kids had. I thought she was troll. I

thought she's fucking with me. She's fucking with me. I know she's fucking with me. Right.

I was like, so I run over there. They're not in there. I said, where are they? She goes,

I gave them to the kids to play with. I said, when? She goes, when? I said, when? She goes,

a while back. Oh, okay. Okay. We'll stay calm. Let's stay calm. Let's stay calm. I said,

where are they now? She goes, I think we put them in one of the dono bags for the toys that we gave

away. So, so the reason I walked away there is because it's not entirely her fault. She doesn't

gamble. Shouldn't go to the casinos. And when we were in a Twitch con, they gave us a whole bunch

on the back. It was just for fun. And it's from a company that had these. And we gave them to the

kids to play with. My wife, for some reason, obviously, thought that they were a bunch of

these because all of the chips were black. If you know, you know.

Also, what's a good YOLO?

This is my fault for keeping them at home. And so now I am left with a bunch of these

black chips, but not those. And for those of you asking why I keep my black chips or my chips at

home instead of cashing them out, the reason is, is because I do not like when I go there,

because I don't go there very often, to have to go to the cashier's cage, wait for people to cash

them out, go to the table.

You know, put the cash down and then slow down the game. And I just like to have them walk in, play with

them, color up and leave. That's what I do. I will never do that again. Or I will buy a, I will put

them in a safe. Takes like four minutes. You must go to a very boring fucking degenerate like casino

because when I get up and I get a $500 or $100 chip and I go to the thing on a Friday night,

it's a 30 minute wait for that shit. I just want to go home. I don't want to wait 30 minutes again.

So I just take them and I put them in my, in my,

in my little hidden spot. Apparently she was cleaning out. She saw them, thought they were

these, gave them to the kids, kids play with them, done. We're donating, getting rid of stuff before

our move. And somebody, 30 minutes, LOL. Yeah, right. Hey, listen, man, you can look like a

dumbass pretending you know what every casino in the world does at what time. But if you go to the

guitar seminal hard rock casino on a Friday night, especially when there's a major event happening

and you want to go and they have one of their cashier cages closed and you're not a VIP member,

wait up to 30 minutes. Yes, you will. Maybe 20. I don't want to wait. I don't want to wait 20

minutes. Okay. This wasn't something that I expected. So yeah, you can, you can, what was

his name again? I want to see our, our, our, our tough guy who knows everything about everybody.

Hold on. Where was he? I want to make sure I remember this guy. Cause I need to know if I

ever go to a casino, he's the person I need to talk to because he knows everything about casinos.

But yeah, that's, that is, um, that is what happened. And if you learn from your mistakes,

they're investments.

I just Googled it. And a black chip is generally a $100 a chip. Yeah. So yes,

my wife learned last night that these are money, right? Dear. What do you mean?

You could have got it all back if you didn't sell CRM. Okay. Not the time, bro. Not the time.

Not the time. Not the time. I'm going to need you to chill the fuck out for two seconds. Not the

time. Not the time for your bullshit. Really? Not the time. Really not. It's probably perfect

time for you, but not the time little bro. Okay.

All right. Where are we? Um, I think I'm going to add a EHR call today. I don't want to tap too

much of the capital because we got a lot of leftovers and I got to, um, withdraw and I need

to settle cash to do that. I'm going to be looking at stocks for the first time. Any advice? Yeah.

Just, um, don't get in your own way. The market is not here for you to make money. It's for you

to grow money. Dollar cost average, total market funds. It sounds boring, but all the people out

there telling you that's just, you can't touch that money to your older. It's a boring way of

doing it. They're all the ones that are going to go.

Trying to do this. And then they're going to be wishing they did it like everybody else who

tried. You ain't that person. They ain't either. They're lying to you. And, uh, yeah. Um, don't

be stupid. Do it the right way. There's a reason why we, it works. A lot of people in here tried

doing it years ago and wish they just would have put their money in the total market and fucking

forgot about it. And just dollar cost average. It'd be doing a lot better. Hell of people. I

wish they did that last week. Then he's excited that he's with me today, but I can't take him

to the monster play place because I don't have a car. That's the different play place. He wants

her one with all the monster stuff because we play the games and he gets to use a little crane

with the candy and the lights. And then we buy prizes. And I have like, I found a game there

that I, that, that was like, remember that game that I made the guy, the guy at the, at the, at

the play place legitimately had to call the manager. Cause he thought that I had like cheated

or something because of how many points I had. So there's a game at the, if you've ever seen,

I'll give you guys a little hint. So there's a game at a lot of places and you've probably seen

it where it's like pushes the little, the little thing where it pushes coins off.

Right. But it's a Rick and Morty thing. And most people who play it don't understand how it

works. And what happens is, is you get these little things and you, you, you, you have to

hit them. And once they all light up, you know, little balls fall down, then you get like a big

ball. So they just do it trying to get the chips. They don't know that once all those things light

up, you get the big bonus. So I just go around and I wait for somebody to play it, get off of it

and light most of it up. I put in for $1, whatever it goes through. And then the thing spins. And if

you just wait until the green one goes,

hit the ball, it goes in the red, hits the bonus every time. So we only had $40 on the,

on the game card. And I went to the game at the arcade and I have a 3000 points because it was

500 every bonus. And the guy's like, at first he's like, how, how, how, how long y'all been

coming here? I said, Oh, this is our second time. So he went and got the manager. And I said,

listen, I'm going to be real with you. That game is, is, is a hack. And he says, tell me how you

did it. I said, no, I'm not going to tell you how I did it, but you know, I mean, I'll be real

with you. And he said, I'm not going to tell you how I did it, but you know, I mean, I'm going to

be real with you. Like, I'm not trying to ruin it. Like whatever. So we have all these points

and we can buy any fucking thing they have at the arcade. And my son, like, you know, of course you

spend, that's the thing about like fairs and stuff like that. All the little toys in like,

if you bought them directly, it would cost you 50 cents to a dollar, but it costs you like

$70 to, to get enough points to buy it. You're not cheating. I'm not cheating. I didn't scam

any kids. It's not cheating. It's like tax evasion versus avoidance. Okay. Avoidance is not illegal.

Okay. That's not cheating. It's using the system that is in place to the best of your advantage.

Why snitch? I didn't snitch. I was just honest. The guy's like, how'd you get so many points?

I was like, well, the game is easy. Tell me how you did. I'm not going to tell you how I did it.

The fun fact is, is that they probably don't want to get rid of it. It's kind of like cash back on

a credit card, right? They know that for every one person like me, everyone else doesn't understand

that. And so they get a lot of stuff because people don't know how to get the bonus. But my son is,

is, and I have gotten kind of closer. And part of the reason is because of all the superhero

costumes and all the play and stuff like that and all this stuff. So like, uh, my wife's taking my

daughter to the, to the mall today and they're going to be gone all night. So she told my son

that it's just him and daddy today. And he's like jumping around in the, in the living room right

now. So he's like really pumped. Okay. All right. What do we got? We've got NVX still up 20% NNE up

3%. We've got D pro 15% today. MLTX is up pretty good. VTR is up good. Yes. From yesterday, you,

you, you now over $20, ladies and gentlemen, we are now up. Even though we averaged up, we are now

up 280% on you, you, you, you, what a damn run this has been. There was some concerns in the

beginning. Maybe we were wrong about this. Maybe the energy, we nailed it. It's looking good. Um,

and they got a lot of news today too. They're, they're, they're getting a lot of focus right

now because I think a lot of people are realizing what we kind of realized back in the day, uh,

with them as far as uranium, but now with the China, uh, uh,

precious metal, um, export curbs, it looks like that the U S is going to have to look for,

you know, in-house, uh, refining and, uh, you, you, you is the only one that's actually set up

right now to do it at scale. Are you holding GER stocking? No, I think I'm all out of GER.

Unless I have a little bit left over. Let me see. I have a few shares left. Yeah. If it goes under

19, I'll play it again. What about UEC? I mean, UEC is nice because they have the uranium, uh,

you know, production and everything going on in, in Wyoming and stuff like that. But it's not about

as a secondary. It's not just about uranium. It's about the actual refining of these materials.

And they're the only one set up to do at scale. And if China is cutting us off, depending on where

we get it from, we're gonna have to do it more in-house at least for a little while and less

anticipation. And if that's the case, even if it's just a transitional period, they're the one set up

for it right now. You only one for scale. I didn't say they're the only one for scale. I've said the

only one currently able to do it. A lot of people thought it was going to be MP, but MP can't do it

at the scale. You, you can, even though, you know,

it's mostly uranium. Can you draw a line on Google like you did yesterday? Wait, what happened

with the line on Google yesterday? I drew it right before I got off stream. I didn't even see. I got

sucked out of GPUSO. That was a nice play. That was, are you shitting me? I'm gonna be real with

you. I'm not a TA guy, but this 240 is protected pretty hard. And I think we're gonna do one of

those. I don't know. It's too early to tell, but, um, Google's trying to combine all that shit

together.

Right now, uh, YouTube, um, what was the other one? Um, Gemini and, uh, co-pilot or whatever

autopilot. Okay. Yeah. Right. All right. Marbles. And then we have to do, uh, we have to do news as

well. I don't want to get, I don't want to get too far behind today. All right, let's go. All

right. Get in, get in, get in, get an exclamation point. Play. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. And here to ask a question. I

hope you got your answered your question when you asked, uh, no gold, no chips. What's a good YOLO?

All right. Go, go, go, go. Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in. Exclamation point. Play. Go,

go. You know what the prizes are. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do

it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. When is your whiteboard on the tree that almost caused

World War III going up on your, uh, on your Instagram? I liked the whole version, but I'd

like to see a condensed version. Uh, I don't know. I'll ask Will. I'm sure my new editor will put

the whole story out on YouTube. Um, I'll ask him. Have I paid him? I should probably see if I paid

him before I started asking him. Nah, fuck him.

Overpaid asshole. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in,

get in, get in, get in, get in, get in. Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go,

let go, let go. What position are you down the worst on right now? Um, Verizon. It's early,

but God damn. I mean, technically it'd be Tilray, but it's such a small position that it,

it's not like from a value standpoint. Can you move the pick in the other corner so we can see

who dies? Is that better? Wait, hold up. TOS?

Sir, my shoulders are not a TOS. I show my shoulders every day at the end of stream.

Sorry that there's water on them this time. I thought you didn't believe in evolution.

What the fuck? Who said that? Shoulders equal TOS. Giving birth on stream is okay.

I'm actually thinking about doing the, uh, the, the first ever, uh, um, natural, uh, insemination,

uh, on, uh, on my stream. It's natural. It's not the first time it's ever been filmed and released.

And, um, it's a part of life. I'm sorry. Did I just get involved?

In some drama? God damn it. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm sorry. All right, let's just go.

Let's just go. Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in. I actually don't have a problem with, uh,

with, with, with what happened. It's, you know, fucking whatever, you know, and it didn't show

anything and it's part of life. I mean, fuck it. If people want to tune in and there's a warning

on it, then fucking go for it. I mean, but think of the kids that, why aren't you talking about

when streamers are dropping fucking like death threats and fucking slurs in, in gaming lobbies

live? Oh, well,

shut up. You just want something to bitch. You, you bitch about people that are woke and fucking,

uh, uh, snowflakes. And then you snowflake out just as much because it's a woman. Like,

I mean, I'm not even trying to be a fucking simp here. It just makes sense.

Like, don't just, just, you know what I mean? Oh wait, nevermind. I'm not allowed to say those

nice things because I'm supposed to be a sexist misogynistic or whatever. Um, all right. Do we

have, okay, I gotta get going. What is the, um, here you go. Let's go. Oh, this should piss off

enough people.

Only 430 people are in marbles. That must mean he's botting. No, most of my people are lurkers,

but thank you. Yo lurkers, don't come out of lurking. I ain't asking you. You stay in the

shadows. I respect it. This music is pure poetry and my poet shares are popping. I just got a

message from Disney. What the fuck? Wait, what? Dismiss. You deserve to get canceled for this

song. Uh, did you see they're not going to count lurkers or people using ad blockers as viewers?

So they won't count as,

far as revenue. Um, Twitch said that, or did some streamers say that? I don't know.

My daughter has gotten on that weeb shit. And at first I was like, Oh no. But then I was like,

you know what? I'm about to Google this. And if it's true, then I'm going to stop,

you know, playing it in the morning. But if it's not, I am banning you.

And I hope the fuck you never, ever, ever go into anyone else who's a parent's fucking thing and try

to ruin their day by saying, Oh, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to

some egregious shit like that. I'm dead serious. I'm dead fucking serious. Like even joking about

that to a father of a small, small children. It isn't even funny. I'm just letting you know that

that like, it's not even, that's not even like content that that's like fucked up, man. So I'm

going to check it later. Not on stream. That's weird, man. That's fucking weird. It was something

I was told, wait, it doesn't matter how you did it. You decided to not look that up yourself and

say that in an open forum to a father who's talking about how much he enjoyed it. And I'm like,

enjoys waking up his daughter happy with a song and dancing. And that's what you said.

Like you've been with me since before GameStop. And that's where you decided to end it.

Like, that's not even cool. Like that actually affects me. Cause like, I'm like, Oh shit. If

that's true, I don't want to have that as part of my household. You know what I mean?

Fucking weird people, man. I'll check on it later. Goddamn CRM is still going.

That was probably, uh, another, uh, that was, uh, that was another one that, uh, I, uh, I sold

too early. Guy at my bank said a lot of fraud goes on for people who are just starting in the

military. Is that true? What kind of fraud are you talking about? Like them committing fraud or

fraud against them? Which one are you talking about? Fraud against them? Your NVX play hit

bigly today. Yeah. Um, Emmetis is not going. Oh, it's fine. I'm, I got time. I got time. I got

time. Um, I, they're, they're ripe for fried fraud. I wouldn't say a lot of fraud happens.

I think a lot of, they don't have,

they don't have the financial education going in. And so it fucked with them. Okay. Okay. So

here's the thing. All right here about self-management of your money. Once you're

educated on it. Okay. If you're not educated on it, just like with even trading stocks,

which is a different level. If you're not educated on something, I don't want you to do it. I don't

want you finding, I don't want you self managing your own money and your own assets on a day-to-day

basis, unless you understand what you're doing. Going into it without understanding is how you

get broke. You get ripped off. And even for people who don't want to self-manage it, I want them to

be smart. Is trying make money of you. And you know what? A lot of bullshit things that we believe

are done because it's, it's, it's, it's marketing and propaganda campaigns from institutions that

make money off of you. One that I fight with people for two years now, always buy instead,

instead of, of rent.

If you can, of course, every single person who tells you that is somebody who's making money

you off of buying a house. There are times when renting is better than buying the past two years

has been a great example, but who's going to tell you that, right? Not the bank who owns the mortgage,

not the lending company who takes a commission, not the real estate agent who makes money off of

you, not the contractor, not the inspector. Okay. Not the government who gets tax money off of you.

Right. No, one's going to tell you that not the fucking course sellers who are trying to get you

to fucking.

By real estate, because they told you they did it and they made a bunch of money when in reality,

they're either leveraged to the tits and about to fucking fall off a cliff, or they're actually

making money off of selling you this course instead of actually doing it themselves.

Here's the thing. Those who can't play coach, whether it's because they did play and they're

retired, whether they're not good enough to play or whatever, those who can't play coach.

Okay. Generally. So, and it's not always a bad thing. I'm just saying in general. So these are,

these are, these are hard.

Truths. Money is made off of financial illiteracy. GDP, our GDP runs on financial

illiteracy. Two in 20. People still do it. There are people out there paying two and 20 to

underperform the market every year, but because they don't know enough about money, some company

is, is just taking all of their fucking money because why they know more than they do. Right.

But I also say, if you're not financially astute or you don't have good financial,

education, don't self-manage your money. Okay. If you win the lottery, first thing you should do

is shut the fuck up. Second thing you should do is hire a lawyer and an accountant and then put

that shit with some large firm. Because guess what? If you don't come from money and you don't

understand money, you get a big windfall of money. You're going to lose it all. Well, if I just buy

this stock, I'll listen to this person. I'll do that. Fucking pay your 1% and let somebody else

manage it because they also come with lawyers and they come with, with, with, with shit that

protects your money. Not just the, the, the, the, the, you know, the, the, yeah, they take 1%,

you know, compounding annually, which sucks, but it's not just the firm. It's the protection.

It's the, it's the law. It's the lawyers. It's the everything. They got everything that you need

as well. That's part of what you're paying for. So it's, it's a difficult thing. So I'm not always

against that, but everyone is trying to make money off of you. Everyone. That's the point.

Everyone is trying to make money off of you. Okay. Even me who doesn't ask you for a fucking dime.

I don't want any of your goddamn money, but I'm still making money off of you. Not as much as I

could, but I'm still making money off of you. Right? How? If you don't sub, you watch ads. I

still make money. If you sub, you don't have to watch ads. Helps you out. I get, I get a portion

of that too. Right? I'm not actively trying to make money off you, but I'm making money off you.

Right? That's, that's how people make a living. That's how you make a living. You got to extract

from someone else. That's just, that's just how it is. It's uncomfortable to say, but that's the

truth. You make money from this. Not a lot, but I do make some. I make money off your signal service.

This is not a signal service.

Okay. I make more money off you that I've made more money off you than you could ever make off

me. Okay. That's not for now. Wait till the next market down to down, downfall. So everyone's trying

to make money off of you because financial illiteracy is the most profitable business

in the universe. I was going to say in the world, but I need some controversial shit.

It is our entire GDP in the United States.

The reason the United States of America is the most powerful, biggest economy,

biggest military is because we are the financially fucking stupid. Every dime we make, we spend,

and then we go into debt. We are consumers. One third of the entire world's consumer market is

the United States of America. Okay. Okay. We, this is, this is, this is the most finance. This,

this is why on YouTube, if you are a financial creator and you put out actual good quality

videos and people watch it, your CPM is as high as $35.

It's around sometimes 18 bucks, sometimes 20 bucks, 20 bucks per thousand views because

it's so lucrative. Okay. Everyone wants to make a buck off you and you're good. And they're going

to, they're going to, everything costs money. Some people are actively trying to take your

money. Some people are inactively. It doesn't matter. That's where it comes from. So once you

understand that, you will understand why all the fucking financial gurus and furus are showing up.

The course sellers, the signal service people, the fucking, the fucking, uh, you know, uh, this

is the, then they put the, the, the, you know, the, the clickbaity titles and the fucking red,

Oh my God, it's over the market's done or whatever like that. Do you know who, do you know what kind

of financial creator makes the least amount of money? The one who tells you not to panic.

It's true. It's true. There is a reason why there aren't very many other people doing what I'm

doing. I'm not fucking self glazing. This isn't a Trump conference. There's a reason why it's much

more profitable to put out videos with a red arrow and a fucking, uh, a fucking, uh, a fucking

fire and your face like this of this is the crash 2008 all over again, the bubbles bursting

because that's what's going to get clicks, right? Nobody clicks. Hey guys, good thing your DCA

markets up this year. Nobody clicks that shit. That's why I'm the only one doing what I'm only

dumb enough to do this. Okay. Sex sells, but not as much as fear does. Okay. Or do the opposite.

Promise people the world and make them pay you for it. Pretend that you've got the world and

make people say, if you want what I have, you got to pay me for it.

People eat that shit up. Financial illiteracy is insane. And it's very difficult to become

financially literate because it is very difficult. It's time consuming. There's a lot of different

things. It's intentionally made to be complicated, uninteresting, and, and, and, and, and, you know,

intimidating that it's because people won't want you to be that way. They want you to fucking give

them your money. The amount of people I talk to on a regular basis who don't have basic, what I

would consider basic financial education is, is, is, is insane, but it's not their fault. It's

ignorance. It's not stupidity. So let's get back to the original question. Who are the people,

the largest group of people who are the most vulnerable to this military? Why are military

guys? And I wish that I could like go talk to new recruits or people going into the military

or like people in the military and talk to them about what to do in the, because I was in the

military too. Like I went through this and I'm the stock guy now. So like I have a little bit of both

person to take advantage to in the short term. Let's talk about why, why is it that military

people, or sorry, let me try that again. I don't want to say military people. Why is it that people

that join the military are the most taken advantage of when it comes to financial scams and, and, and,

and getting screwed over? Why? Number one, they're young. Okay. The younger you are, the less

experience you have, the less times you've been burnt, the less, you know, the, the, the way you

see the world works. Your, your view of the world is mostly what you're paying attention to. So

parents, family, and school has, you know, you know, experience has been, remember you are the

sum of the five people you spend the most time with. That's who you are. Think about the people

you spend the five, the five people you spend the most time with, and then look at yourself.

It's accurate. Okay. That's why sometimes if you want to be, you know, advanced in the world or in

life, you got to make yourself uncomfortable and change your group of people you spend time with,

because you'll eventually morph into that. Okay. So if you want to be more successful or more

business minded or more educated, you're going to have to make yourself uncomfortable.

You need to spend time with those. If you spend time with people who are in their thirties and

they still fucking smoke pot, drink beer and work a part-time job all day, you're probably not going

to get, and you want to do something different. You're probably not going to advance there. If

you don't move to people, you know, find a group of people or people you spend time with that are

more focused. I'm not selling you some fucking motivational course here of like, you got to

change your mindset, change the people you want to be successful, find successful people, learn

from them, and then fucking take everything from them. Like it's cutthroat business. Fuck,

damn, you know, like, no, I'm not doing that shit, but they're young. Easiest people to prey on.

Number two, who do you think the vast majority of people who joined the military are?

You think they're from high income families? You think they're from, you know, high cost of living

area, living people, and generally from red States, red States, very pro military, very

conservative thing, lower income. You do it. Do you know, here's a little fun fact. Do you know

that most people who joined the military, probably 90 to 95% of them don't give a shit about the whole

USA, USA fight for a fucking, you know, freedom and a goddamn, whatever. No, the fastest, most

direct way from lower income to middle income for people in America is to join the military.

I'm not, this isn't a military recruiting ad, but the fastest, easiest, or most direct path to move

from lower income to middle income or lower middle, whatever, to join the military is to join the military.

but the middle in middle or whatever is the military okay all right i'll tell you why you go

in you get you get paid but it's not a lot of money but guess what when you're 18 years old

and you're making back then in e3 i was in e3 because i whatever but e1 e2 you're getting used

to get paid like 1800 a month it's probably closer to 2500 maybe more but it's tax free and you don't

have to pay for anything right so let's say you're getting you're 18 years old you start out now at

30 000 a year okay 30 000 a year 30 000 a year tax free that's number one so that's like making

40 000 a year at 18 so equivalent of 40 000 okay but here's the thing you might think 40 000 ain't

a lot of money well for an 18 year old it is but you might not think it's a lot of money well guess

what you don't pay for rent food two biggest costs right there studio apartment in

those towns and cities is going to run you over a thousand dollars fifteen hundred dollars minimum

so let's go ahead and tack on another twenty thousand dollars a year food let's go ahead and

tack on another what especially for an 18 year old guy or even girl let's call another ten thousand

a year minimum health insurance is covered you don't pay that go ahead put another six thousand

a year on that okay now you'll lose half of it once you marry your high school sweetheart that

you didn't you thought was going to love you forever and always but you take her halfway

she knows and she just sits in a house all day waiting for you but let's not talk about that

so let's add that up you're 18 19 years old and you are making like a gross 40 50 60 70 75 78

look called rounded up to 80 000 a year right adjusted now you get a cost of living increase

every year of three to five percent well usually three percent and as you rank up you get more

money your college is paid for but you don't need a college even if you only do

four years in you get out you got the gi bill college is free of course i'm 20 years later

and still haven't finished my degree so this is the fastest way and the most direct way

also fun fact if i would have stayed in i would have retired two years ago oh my god i said that

out loud okay so you can stay in as an enlisted person you go into 18 you are retired at 38 years

old and you're keeping something like 60 70 percent of your

your final you know uh paycheck as your retirement tax-free the rest of your life

guess what most of those people do my brother-in-law is retiring as an e8 this year

we graduated at the same high school he was one year ahead of me and you know what he's keeping

that he is 41 years old and guess what he's doing he's already got a job lined up at a

defense company that i can't name for his personal reasons you also keep your health

benefits the rest of your life

okay va loan everything like that now again it sounds like i'm promoting the military i'm not

i'm explaining why people from low-income areas join the military there are people from the inner

cities and from from from other demographics as well that aren't told this until it's too late

that find out hey this is my way out i met a lot of those guys in the military back then they were

like hey listen like i i was i was from a really shitty area they don't tell us this because it's

like military like i did this to get out and you know what people do that i'm not a military man

so okay young lower income and red states now you give an 18 year old kid send him off to boot

camp and then tech school or or ground combat school or whatever the fuck you go to and he's

getting all that back pay and then he gets done and he's been doing that for six months six months

at two grand 2500 you know a month let's say two grand a month six months of that tax-free he gets

out his bank account has 12,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

he has never had more than 120 in a bank account if he ever had a bank account before

so you take an 18 year old kid who has no financial education from a lower income place where he's

never had any significant amount of money in his life his family's never had any significant amount

of this and he's come from a conservative state where probably they're all hoorah whatever and

you put 10 to 12,000 in his bank account what the fuck do you think's about to happen now you're

asking me why the military people are younger military people are most taken advantage of

because guess what

they don't know how to spend their money they don't understand it they see all this money and

they think what can i do with all this money well their only experience is people with money

flashing off their money because that's how people sell right you're in a lamborghini you're in this

you're in that and girls all around you and drinks and stuff like that so what do you do

that that that that camara or that that corolla over there let me tell you something right now

it's gonna be tough to get them ladies in there when you go out of uh you know on the weekends

from the base plus it just doesn't have that sound coming through the front gate of the base

when you come through they're letting everybody know that you mean business bet your papa would

be proud too seeing you brand new car that kind of muscle looking at you saying you've really

i've seen pansies and pussies come through here that didn't last a fucking week

but i see a guy like you you're a two-termer minimum

i normally wouldn't do this for anybody else i'd make him pay it up front because i i tell you right

now that's a long time but that's trust because i trust you i can see it really yeah wow that's

really nice of you let me tell you something right now you decide you don't like that car

you come on in we'll trade in for something else one day really that's right wow you're the best

no problem sign it right here what does that mean well son you ain't got to worry about that unless

you're late in your payments you're gonna be late in your payments now are you nope then it's not

it's not much you know i mean it's 17 you know i mean think about it that's only an extra hundred

and something dollars a month shit you don't need that i'm sorry i really have gone too fucking far

right now i i got lost in the character what was i talking about oh yeah yeah so yeah so so these

people are the most taken care of so so when you say rp is there fraud against these people

they're ripe for fraud because they are young and they're from places where they they come from low

poverty they don't have experience with money they get this money and so they're they're big

targets for it and they're not going to be able to make a lot of money and they're not going to

very easy targets for it but everybody is i mean anybody crypto is getting fucking the older

people everybody is a target right now especially people do you want to know the biggest fucking

targets are the people who are fucking paying hundreds of dollars a month for fucking sock

signals or fucking real estate courses or fucking you know that those are everybody is nobody wants

to admit it but everyone's getting getting rolled over it's people are you know are financially

uneducated so is is there is it rampant fraud against those i'm sure there is but it's generally

levelесс andcrime against people that are really highly motivated andágrigable so i'm

really gonna limit that moment today to ian mcdonough he might be somewhat likely to say

he has never received funds now but a friend of mine had and he actually helps like somebody

with a disability and with just like he was able to come out of that this month with an

account for havingpmcad and or

unwillingly

Afghanistan and I was there and I came back with all my money. I bought Apple stock because I

learned about the stock market. But what I didn't learn about was how not to panic sell because that

was 2007. And the next year was 2008. And I was down 41 percent. And I was like, I'm going to

take my money out. And it went down further. And I was like, that's cool. And then I just never

looked at it again. You're always learning, guys. A bunch of hookers and cocaine. No, absolutely.

Way worse than that. I don't want to tell the story again. I had a real hard problem when I

was younger, because as you saw, I was like decent looking back then, but I had no fucking confidence.

And so that led me to a lot of fucking problems for myself. And it all ended on Valentine's

morning, 2008, when that girl broke up with me. That's when stocky changed. That changed

everything. When the fuck were you decent looking? OK, bitch. The puppy thing. Yeah.

I wonder how she's doing these days. Probably not so well. Villain, the origin story. No,

it was just the final straw. You murdered her. No, I didn't murder her. This was a long whiteboard.

I didn't mean to do this. But somebody asked me a simple question. Do you think there's a lot of

fraud against military, young military members? I could have just said no. Is it a good time if

you have knowledge to start a YouTube finance YouTube channel? I mean, if you have good content

and it's well edited and you have an editor that you don't overpay,

for shit work, then maybe. Yeah, probably. It's not easy, though. Everyone, everyone thinks that

content creation is easy. Like, oh, I'm knowledgeable at something. So people want

to listen to me. And then you're like, why is it that somebody who doesn't know what the fuck

they're talking about is getting a million times more views than I am or viewers than I am?

That doesn't make any sense. Or why is this person, you know, good at it and talking,

but nobody's watching them? Because there's a million reasons. There's no there's no like

there's no single thing that causes.

People to watch you. I don't know why the fuck people watch me. And I do this for a living.

Every time I turn on my stream and go live, I'm like, I hope people show up today.

That's literally me. Like, I have no fucking clue. And that's that's honest truth. This isn't

like a fishing for a compliment thing. Like, I, I don't know, because some people in here watch

me because they're like, yeah, you know what? Once or twice a day, I learned something about

money or education. Some people are here because they like the whiteboard. Some people watch because

they trade stocks actively. Some people are here for YOLO. Some people here just because they want

or they want to know about the market updates or they want to hear about financial news or they

want to hear about me and my wife joke, you know, our little back and forth. Some people like the

fucking inappropriate jokes. Some people just like the fact that it's total chaos. And because it's

total chaos, when the show's over, they look back and say, wait, that was four hours. Hell,

half my workday's done. Everyone's got a different reason. You can't you can't try to figure out why

it's better to find out why people don't watch than to why they do watch.

Um, I just need to something to drown out the my chronic depression.

I don't know. You live in a fucking country where it's frozen half the year and the other half the

year it's overcast and it you can't afford a house in six generations of wealth and nobody wants to

bang you because you just lay there like a fucking starfish. Like, you know, I'm sorry. I'm I'm I

like the random history stories. I got to my I got to own my husband the other night with the

Operation Paul Bunyan. He didn't know about that and he knows everything. Really? See that right

there? Quits.

That's the kind of you sound like my therapist. Yeah, well, at least your therapist gets paid.

Thanks for selling CRM stocky. Wait, is this? I was actually thinking about holding this one more

day. Yeah, I had a therapist refund my money once. He thought I was lying. I told him to look it up.

He got real quiet quick. That's what I love about the Oh my God, they're they're they're they're

actually 750 a piece now. Um, thanks for the Google signal. There was no signal. It didn't move.

It's just now coming back up to the line. Is there a right? My ex got fired from he's what's he's?

What was the reason for the CRM by so I bought CRM yesterday and we actually caught it at the exact

moment of the bottom live right here. It was wild too. I was like told everybody on the call. I'm

going to buy it, whatever, wait for the consolidation, saw a big volume came on the

cell, saw up to came down. I was like, all right, I'm buying here, but I only legged in. I bought

two contracts for what was it? 550 a piece or whatever. And it just, it was the exact bottom.

the the reason why i bought it may not be the reason that it went up yesterday

but whatever the reason i bought it was it ended up working out in my favor

and the reason i bought it was because they said to the hacker group that yo nuclear thanks man

um thanks for gifting the subs uh to uh puss pummy uh chase collect sashimi shrock and pickle dick

thank you um but uh but yeah so so again the reason that i bought crm was because they said

that they were not going to pay the ransom to the hacker group and most people were like they

got hacked that's bad news they're not paying it which means their data is going to get out and

people are going to be upset and my thought was number one retail is going to think that that's

a chad move and or number two that basically says the data you got we don't think is worth it

even if that's not the case that's the aesthetics and so i thought that would be a good dip

opportunity to buy

you

classy community i'm comfortable here aren't you the one who said yesterday as a lesbian you've

learned more about pleasing a man here than you ever could have anywhere else education right

are you holding mnts yes i what guys what this is this is called legging in this is called

legging we actually got another one at 155 now here's the thing though this is where i'm gonna

start scalping because this is the same low as yesterday and so what i'm gonna do now is

is i'm gonna take 100 shares

and i'm gonna put each one of those at a certain stop loss level this is what i'm doing not what

you should do okay all right so i'm going to take 100 shares and i'm gonna put one at two percent

one at three percent one at five percent one at seven percent and let it go this is one that i

held for months before i watched it go like two thousand percent not saying that's gonna happen

again i'm legging into this i wish i would have started legging in later to be honest

but shit happens every two percent i'm gonna put a stop loss in may not work out i don't know

at this point start to look like it really might not and then if it starts bouncing and comes back

down i can make some money off the last buy and if it doesn't then fuck it i take the l

um your average is 183 my average is probably not much better my average is uh 179 uh i wish you

could you so i could i wait i watch you so i could have enough so i can visit southeast asia to find

my wife and she won't leave me because of my big house and her papers hopefully she will love for

me too okay why is it same based

and feel strong man thanks for the google line i actually missed it on the google line

i missed the first dip i mean it did dip it just dipped a little harder than we thought it would

of course i didn't take google calls well i didn't ask the bot for google i said um

uh microsoft or jobe and it said jobe damn that n and e play actually worked out i

didn't that that was surprising yeah passport bros are hilarious is that like a crypto bro

now like what are we i don't know what these things are you guys gotta

like keep me informed here are you still on we ride of course i am would you get back into longer

dated n and e calls uh i mean i'm happy with my shares um i i obviously i'm i'm i'm uh keeping my

n and e shares but i'm kind of on the uh mirror leaps even though i took them way too far out

uh train right now damn imrx was fucking flying pre-market and gave it all back and then fell

how these i have too many um too many calls now hey sake i got fired last monday and got

8 000 compensation any advice on how dca this dca what your job passport bro means they go to

impoverished countries looking for a wife that that can't leave them it's weird i mean kind of

but like if you think about it you do the same shit here except for instead of going and doing

it cheaper you try to make as much money have as big of a house and nicest car to attract a woman

who will stay with you because or get with you because you have a lot of money and and then you

continue to do that because you think that's what got her with you and therefore that is what is

all the while maybe she did like you for you and you worked so hard trying to make more money

thinking that's what keeps her that you end up distancing yourself from her and that's what

causes her to leave or you married somebody with for that reason and then you wonder why they

fucking left you for somebody else with more money so at least these guys are just doing it cheaper

than you are i mean toxic how is that what because you got called out that doesn't make it toxic i'm

not even defending what a passport bro is i don't the fuck a passport bro is but but i mean it just

like oh we hate them because they go to other countries where you know women will marry them

for money or because they can give them a better life and then they can't leave them and i'm like

that sounds fucked up but you're hoping the same thing happens it just costs you more here i'm not

talking about somebody who actually like traffic somebody that's fucking different right why are

you so angry i'm not starting beef with passport bros i'm not doing that women of this generation

are all trash anyway sorry not sorry

that that's that's that's where you went with that let me tell you something buddy and i'm not

trying i i'm not defending women here but i have to just call you out on your bullshit there i'm

not a white knight i think it's very clear hell i had a woman in here telling me i was the most

sexist misogynistic woman hater he's ever met she's ever met i'm like what the fuck but let

me tell you something here do you want to know why you're wrong about that the bar is so fucking low

for you right now right because of how many people like you are and you're not a white knight

there are now the bar is so low right now that you don't even have to do or have what you used

to to get a good quality partner they're looking for somebody who's just fucking normal at this

point not about being rich not about being the best look at just somebody who's fucking normal

that's the bar now okay and i'm not trying to like stick up for the women in here but it's

just the truth i'm not going to bullshit you like literally y'all are overthinking it the bar is

become you disagree well then you're probably you know that maybe you're in the wrong place

looking for it the bar is so low now because of just the way the world is that there are like

the the perfect people for you out there that maybe generally wouldn't go on a date with you

or whatever like that because it just wasn't faux pas or they may not but the bar is so low that

like just being normal is a huge plus right now yes people want to have security and homes and

things like that down the line but the problem is you guys are so caught up with the internet

because it's our only way of talking to people that you've disconnected from reality and you

think because your algorithm has picked up this certain thing that you look at and it's made you

like like like jaded and whatever that you're looking at it and thinking that's how it is

right that's how it is oh women only want to be with men who make six five and are millionaires

and they work in this and like that and all the while they're all sitting at home like why aren't

there any normal fucking guys out there where do they all go nobody asked me out nobody fucking

you know nobody does this i mean sure i mean you know everybody wants to hook up from time to time

so i get why a lot of people on dating sites are hooked up but but nobody even wants to fucking

have it like like i you know where is everybody at and so now they think there's no guys you think

they're all bitches and then everybody gets in their little thing where men only want sex women

are all fucking gold diggers and then nobody and it just creates a void but it keeps you clicking

it keeps you on the screen it keeps your algorithm running okay i'm honest with you right now as a

married man i feel like i took the last i literally feel like someone who took the last chopper out of

nom okay looking down seeing you guys out there like godspeed gentlemen and ladies okay i am

telling you right now this is how bad it is for the dating market i i would never be i'm not going

to be and this is just a complete thing i'm just whatever but if i was single right now even though

i'm 40 and i have a weird fucking job i guarantee you i would have success in the dating world

that's how low the bar is right now that's how low the bar is right now

but you think that it's not even there so you don't bother or you go with this preconceived

notion of oh they automatically want this this this so you start trying to impress them and

all the while people see through it and it falls through okay i'm telling you right now this isn't

even a joke i'm this isn't even a joke right now okay and i'm not trying to like i said like like

there are a lot of women out there that are pieces of shit right just like they're okay hold on

there's like there's a lot of men out there that are pieces of shit right like people are shitty

there are shitty human beings but what i'm saying is is that you've been convinced that that you know

they're all the same way and that they only want they only want money and they want this and they

want status a lot of people just want a partner but it's harder and harder to find and the people

that do finally go on a date with them only talk about themselves only want to impress people only

lie about shit only do whatever you know what i mean here let me let me let me give you a little

hint about life do you want to know why you keep meeting shitty people because you're going places

where shitty people go right the reason you don't find good quality people whether you're a man or

a woman is because you go places where you don't find good quality people and you don't find good

quality people and you don't find good quality people and you don't find good quality people

places pretending to be somebody you're not so people will like you and you end up meeting

people who are also pretending to be somebody they're not so people will like them or accept

them and you don't like each other because you don't like that person because that's not who you

really are you're just pretending to be that person and that person isn't really that person

either so you're running into shitty people stop going where shitty people go and stop pretending

to be a shitty person because if you pretend to be somebody you're not you're going to meet people

that are not you if you're fake you're going to meet fake people

stop doing that shit. Just be genuine. But that is a faux pas now. We're not allowed to be that

way. Do things that are genuine. For example, you want to know the best place. If I was going to

start over again and start dating, like for legit, like relationship dating, not hookup dating,

I wouldn't even touch a fucking dating app. I wouldn't even touch a fucking dating app.

I would find groups of people doing things that I am legitimately interested in. And I would go

hang out with those groups. I'd go on meetup. I'd go on eventbrite. I'd go on all these places

right here. And I would look to see, are there groups of people doing stuff I enjoy? Yes. I'm

going to go hang out with those people. So guess what? You find people that are doing shit that

not in front of cameras and not for social media likes doing shit they like. They have a genuine

interest. They're being genuine themselves and you share an interest. So guess what? You're genuine.

They're genuine. You share an interest. You meet. That is the recipe. Not everybody's going to be

the person that you fucking, you know, every hit it off with, but that's where you go. You've got

things in common and you're genuine instead of fucking dressing up in some fucking clothes that

you don't even like.

To get in a fucking car that you can't afford to go to a place where the cover you're having to

fucking go into debt for to meet a bunch of people pretending to have a bunch of money or a bunch of

success. All the while they go home and fucking cry themselves to sleep and you do the same. And

then that's what you do over and over and over. And then you have empty fucking one night stands

and you have fucking empty fucking bank accounts and you wonder why there's no good people out

there. I'm sorry. I just blacked the fuck out. I just blacked. I'm sorry. I just, I just blacked

the fuck out. That was my bad. I got preachy there for a second.

That's my bad. That's not a trauma dump. I'm just talking. I'm just saying the shit that nobody says

out loud because remember, everyone's trying to make money off of you. Telling you that doesn't

make me money. We should round up women against her. Oh my fuck. No, no, no, no fucking tables

and breed them. That is so against their anonymous smears. That is anonymous smears. That is,

that is completely out of context. And everybody here knows there's no new people that I have to

explain that to. So at least everyone knows what that came from.

I sometimes wonder what other people in this house think when they can't hear or see what's

going on, but just out of nowhere here, yelling from my room context. Somebody said, I said,

I'm as a, as a, as American, I'm worried about troops being on the ground in cities to control

crime or whatever the fucking reason is. And someone says, so you just, so you just want crime

to happen. Right. And I'm like, that is two totally different things. I like wanting crime

to be stopped versus putting American soldiers on the ground and training grounds to take on

American citizens. It's not the same. It's like the conversation.

Of we need higher birth rates to sustain our population and keep it going. Right. So we need

to encourage people to have babies as opposed to what you just heard. And so I was, I was making

a very, you know, like Trump, not live here. Oh, here we go. Get your glazy moats ready

through in the Middle East. Something that people said was never going to be done.

We ended the war in Gaza and really on a much bigger basis created peace.

I think it's going to be a lasting peace, hopefully an everlasting peace.

Peace is alive. Thank you.

We secured the release of all the remaining hostages and they should be released on Monday or Tuesday.

Getting them is a complicated process. I'd rather not tell you what they have to do.

No one in chat will admit this, but your talk was a good one.

All right, whatever.

But we are getting the hostages back on, on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday.

I think we penciled it in at 12 PM. Not sure. Don't tell them.

We're going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there.

And we're working on the timing.

When the doctor was sewing you up, I said, hey, hey, don't sew it, you know, don't sew it all over.

We'll have a signing, an additional signing. We've already had a signing representing me.

It's on Friday, Doc.

But we're going to have an official signing.

And the amazing thing is all of the countries over there from Qatar to Saudi Arabia to UAE to all of them,

the rich ones, the less than rich ones.

They've all come together, something which is amazing, actually.

They've all come together for this.

And they're really probably the best relationships they've ever had.

So it's been really something incredible that nobody thought it was possible to get it done.

Not even me.

Very importantly, the hostages are coming back.

As you know, they consider them hostages.

They talk about them as hostages, but there are approximately 28 dead people.

How come we never talk about the Inuit hostages from World War II?

Mostly men.

And boys. I mean, boys.

I just thought of that.

The one woman talked about her baby. Her baby's 25 years old.

Oh, I got a whiteboard to do today then, huh?

Oh, okay.

Getting them to, getting everything.

And to those parents, the dead young man is just as important.

As though it were, as though this person were alive.

It's amazing. I've never seen anything quite like it.

I've been very much involved.

I've never seen anything quite like it.

But it's, it's really peace in the Middle East.

And you remember October 7th was terrible, but also from the Hamas standpoint,

they probably lost 70,000 people.

That's big retribution.

That's big retribution.

But at some point, that whole, that whole thing has to stop and we're going to...

You're still in your mirror calls?

Yeah, I sold one yesterday.

...see to it because it's going to be slowly redone.

You have tremendous wealth in that part of the world by certain countries and just a

small part of that, what they make well.

What the fuck is Dogtober 7th?

Do wonders for...

Are you fucking re...

What?

...for Gaza.

And I think you're going to see some tremendous...

Are you still in VWOV?

No.

...countries stepping up and putting up a lot of money and taking care of things.

But this tremendous spirit, like I haven't seen.

And even the news, I won't call it fake news for this purpose because they really were

very fair to them.

They were very fair today, I must tell you, in all cases.

But they covered it very well.

They covered it very fairly.

Everybody loves it, everybody.

People that were never giving us a fair shake, frankly, they can't even believe it.

So they're amazed by it, a lot of people are.

But it was...

Just everything came together.

I think the attack was very important.

You guys are still on the Hassan shit?

On Iran.

Jesus Christ.

Because...

If that didn't happen, they'd probably by now have a nuclear weapon, numerous nuclear

weapons.

And therefore, even if we signed a deal, there'd be a big dark cloud over it and it wouldn't

be the same thing.

So Iran's different.

But Iran wants to work on peace now.

You should look at the memes.

They're funny.

And they've acknowledged that they're totally in favor of this deal.

They think it's a great thing.

Okay.

I'll have to look at the context, I guess.

So we appreciate that.

And we'll work with Iran.

As you know, we have major sanctions on Iran and lots of other things.

We'd like to see them...

Yeah.

...be able to rebuild their country too.

But they can't have a nuclear weapon.

So I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey

for helping us reach this incredible day and for being there.

They were there with us all the way.

And of course, as you know, Saudi Arabia...

By the way, we hit all those countries with sanctions today, too.

...so many of them.

I will tell you, President Erdogan was personally involved in dealing with Hamas and some of

the others.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

He's been there.

Yeah, this has been great.

They've all been...

They've all been really amazing.

Indonesia has been amazing.

Indonesia has been fantastic.

The whole world has come together for this, people that didn't get along, people that

didn't like each other, neighboring countries that, frankly, didn't like each other.

But now, it's just this moment in time.

So we look forward to welcoming the hostages like you can't believe home to their families.

And that will take place early next week.

Okay.

We hope Monday or Tuesday and all Americans should be proud of the role that our country

has played in bringing this terrible conflict to the end to an end and I want to thank I mean some

of the people JD you were fantastic and uh Pete you were great Marco is fantastic you better say

thank you very much involved I'm looking around so indirectly I think almost everybody in this room

was involved Susie I want to thank you very much you were incredible you've done an incredible job

so uh and yes uh John uh what you've done was invaluable CIA John Ratcliffe and he's done an

incredible job so I want to thank you all and if I'm missing anybody I apologize but

uh you've been amazing you want me to put an auto mod on Hassan's name

work so hard bro are you okay you've been here so long that's not how this channel operates

seven this is number eight we settled seven wars or major conflicts but wars

uh

this is number eight and the one that I thought would be maybe the quickest of all would be

Russia Ukraine and I think that's going to happen too but in the meantime they're losing about 7

000 people a week and that seems pretty bad they're losing mostly soldiers young soldiers

they go out to war and they they're getting killed and well it doesn't affect us in a lot of ways

we're we've got a big ocean in between uh you don't want to see that happen it was a big mistake

that war should have happened it was a big mistake that war should have happened it was a big mistake

that war should have happened it would have never happened it would have never happened if I were

president so we're here this morning for a cabinet meeting as my administration continues to deliver

for the American people despite the radical left lunatics that shut down our government you have

democrats that they've lost their way they have no leadership we don't even know who to deal with

over there at least they know who to deal with we are we have no idea who we're dealing with over

there it's like they have no idea what they're doing republicans have voted repeatedly to pass

a clean non-partisan bill to reopen government at the same funding levels we're not going to

do anything only good for health care we're we're really I think become the party of good health care

and they keep using health care as a cudgel I want to try and get everyone thinking about

health care we're the ones that are saving damn cudgel that's a big word for him one of the things

we're doing is we're going to be reducing the cost of medicines by 100 200 300 500 and even more than

that because as you know that's right we're reducing prices by 500 the government will pay

you four times what you used to pay so you take it we're subsidizing the entire world the entire

world pays a fraction of what the United States has been paying and we've already numerous Pfizer

and other country companies have already signed and other countries are a bigger problem because

they've been getting a subsidized rate we've been paying

for years this has gone on for 30 years we've been reducing the rate of drugs for other countries

because we've been paying much more than we're supposed to and they used all sorts of ideas like

research and development I said what about Germany what about these other countries

aren't they paying no no we have to pay research and about it was all nonsense and I didn't I just

I couldn't listen to it anymore so it's a very radical big tough shift very tough

we had a lot of things going on today but you know and you probably heard me say this in my

first term uh I think it was my third year we reduced drugs from one from the beginning of the

year to the end of the year and I was so proud of it actually had a news conference to announce it

I can always tell when Chewy's having a good day because my wife hasn't asked me about it

it's barely a reduction but it's the first time in 28 years that there was a reduction in drug prices

for the year so from the beginning to the end it was one hundred percent but it's still going on and it's going to be

First time in 28 years that there was a reduction in drug prices for the year so from the beginning to the end it was one hundred percent

one-eighth of 1 percent.

And I was so proud of myself.

I did something that nobody else could do.

But when I started to think about it, I said,

doesn't make sense.

And then I'm starting to look at numbers where a

pill or a treatment or some pharmaceutical product

is selling in Europe for 10 percent of what we pay

for in New York City or in any one of our places in

cities, states.

And then I see people leaving for other countries

to go buy their pharmaceuticals, where they

make journeys to various other countries,

including Europe, where they got the best bargains

of all.

And I put an end to it.

It's over.

And now we're, you know, in major, I guess,

disputes, but we're winning the disputes by a lot.

With the countries, a couple of countries saying

we won't do this.

The President We're winning the disputes.

It's another war.

Mr. So it's unfair that we're paying 10 percent

and, you know, you're not paying 10 percent.

You're paying just a fraction of what we're

paying for the same product made in the same

plant.

And they said, well, we just, we're not going to

do it.

I said, that's okay.

You don't have to do it.

But I'm going to put a tariff of 9 percent or 7

percent or whatever the amount of money is, and

I'm going to put a tariff on your country for the

amount of money that you're taking advantage of

us for.

No, no, no, you can't.

I said, yeah, I can do that.

I'm going to do that.

And they would immediately agree.

And I'd make the tariff.

Substantially more than the number we're talking

about.

And they would immediately agree.

So we have the consent, I think, Bobby, of every

country, essentially.

They know that if they don't do it, we're going to

put a tariff on for double the price, and then

they're going to do it.

So we never had that before.

You never had anybody in here that knew what the

hell they were doing, I'll be honest.

Really, it makes me angry because for years and

years, and this started many years ago, and

basically we subsidized the world.

So this is going to have a huge positive impact on

Medicare, Medicaid.

Even Social Security.

But anything where there's pharmaceuticals, drugs

involved, it's going to have a tremendous impact.

So we're going to get drug reductions of 100

percent.

I told you, one-eighth of 1 percent that I was proud

of myself.

Now you're going to get 100 percent, 150 percent,

200, 300, 400, 500 percent.

You're going to get the biggest drug reductions

that you've ever seen.

And they're already, I guess, they're starting to

kick in.

But we've made deals with numerous companies.

We're going for the full ball.

We want whatever the price is.

So that would mean that the world price, because

the world is bigger than the United States, a lot

more people, but the world price will go up a little

bit and our price will come down a lot.

So if a pill sells for $10 in London and $100 here,

the pill will go to $20 in London and $20 for us.

It's pretty simple.

The President.

It's pretty simple.

And that is a number that nobody can even fathom.

It's a little like tariffs.

Nobody knew how big they were.

Nobody knew until they started seeing the

trillions of dollars that have come in.

I don't know why they didn't understand it.

Mr. Guys, just go with it, okay?

Just go with it.

Just go with it.

The President.

We were taken advantage of for years with tariffs.

And now, I don't want to say we're taken advantage,

but we've become a very strong country because of

the money that's coming in.

Republicans have voted repeatedly to pass a clean,

nonpartisan bill to reopen our government.

And remember, at the same funding levels, both parties

have supported in the past.

So the radical Democrats have chosen to put the

economy to our country.

We have the best economy we've ever had.

We had the best economy in my first term, but we have

an economy that's blowing it away.

And we have the Democrats that are trying to upset the

Democrats.

They don't want to have a good economy.

I don't think they want to have a good economy.

That's why they try and stop our law enforcement

from doing what we did in Washington, D.C.

Washington, D.C., we have a great, safe, beautiful

capital right now.

Beautiful.

It's so safe.

You can walk down the street.

Numerous people standing before me were mugged.

And you're not going to get mugged anymore.

We have a safe capital, one of the safest.

And we took it from one of the most unsafe places to

one of the most safe places in the country.

And we also beautified it.

And we're in the process of doing.

How much will you short every medical company if

over-cut Americans pay EU rates on drugs?

All long health insurance companies, because they're

going to make a lot more money.

You think they're going to lower premiums for that?

No.

And they end up getting shot.

That's just how I think about it.

We moved out 1,700 people approximately, right?

Approximately 1,700 hardened criminals, career

criminals, they moved them out.

So Chuck Schumer and Hakeem.

Jeffries.

And the congressional Democrats are holding the

entire federal government hostage.

I will tell you, a lot of Democrats want to get this

thing open, too.

They do.

They're calling us, and they want to.

They just want to get it open.

And all we're doing is saying, just play the same

thing until we get it straight.

And they don't know how to go about it.

I mean, it's true.

And the problem is, we really don't know who the

hell is leading the Democrats.

You have this AOC.

I don't know her at all.

But I watched her.

The other day, she said, well, if they want,

they could come to my office.

That's not leadership, you know.

The only one, the challenger, actually, was

Nancy Pelosi.

And Nancy, Nancy's not looking too good.

I don't know what happened to Nancy.

But she's not looking great.

But she was the only one, I give her credit, she was

the only one, the challenger.

But AOC said that they can come to her office and

negotiate, the Republicans.

Speaking of Pelosi, she made over a million bucks

in the market yesterday.

But she's the only one.

She's taking Hakeem Jeffrey's place.

And Schumer is afraid that she's going to run against

him.

And right now, I don't know, he can change.

Life is crazy, right?

But right now, he can't beat.

I don't think he can beat anybody.

So he'll be lo- he'll lose in a primary.

I would say he'll retire before he, before he loses

in a primary.

So I think Schumer is going to retire because he

can't beat anybody.

His polls are so bad.

Meanwhile, the Democrat shutdown is causing pain

and suffering for hardworking Americans,

including our military.

Our air traffic controllers and

impoverished mothers, people with young

children, people that have to live not the greatest

of lives.

But we're doing so many tax cuts.

We've cut their taxes.

The great, big, beautiful bill, we've cut their taxes

at levels that nobody has ever seen.

I mean, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security,

no tax on overtime.

It's been a great thing for a lot of people.

They're doing- they're doing great.

Despite all of the damage that- it's been a great

thing.

It's caused- the shutdown has been, you know,

pretty damaging.

I mean, it's not yet, because it's early, but it

gets a little bit worse as it goes along.

And we'll be making cuts that will be permanent.

And we're only going to cut Democrat programs.

I hate to tell you.

I guess that makes sense.

But we're only cutting Democrat programs.

But we're going to start that.

And we have- Russell can talk to you about it if he

wants to, but we're- we'll be cutting some very

popular Democrat programs.

Programs that aren't popular with Republicans,

frankly, because that's the way it works.

They wanted to do this.

So we'll give them a little taste of their own

medicine.

But Chuck Schumer proclaimed this morning

that every day gets better for them.

No, every day is- it's actually getting worse for

them.

And they're having a rebellion in the Democrat

Party because they want-

Good Rx is in talks with the Trump

administration?

I watched last night, like, ten different times

over the years.

He said, you can't shut down government.

You can't shut down- and now he's the one that shut

it down.

So this is a confession that he's acting not to

serve the people, but to serve the partisan interests

of his party.

And I don't think he's serving them well because

they're way down.

Look, they just lost an election and a landslide.

You know, it was interesting.

I watched Kamala, who's a sad figure.

I watched her the other day saying, the election was

very close.

I said, no, the election was a landslide.

We won the popular vote-

Holy shit.

By millions.

We won the Electoral College by, I think, 312 or

315 to 220-something.

But there's another one that we won that's

probably-that's why when you see the maps, the

maps are completely red.

It's counties.

The counties, we won at 2,505 to 525.

So 2,500 to 525.

That's called one of the greatest, biggest

landslides in history.

And that's one that people are using now as a primary.

But literally, when you see-

Man, CRM just keeps going.

Okay, well, that's just so toxic.

The entire country is red-representing Republicans.

It's a good fucking play.

We nailed it.

Holy shit, it's following the line now.

It's actually followed the line.

That's crazy.

The other side-

It just dipped a little bit more than we thought, but it

just stuck right to it.

I looked at crime numbers in Chicago.

They're through the roof.

And I have a governor who stands up every day and tells

us how wonderful Chicago is.

I don't-it's just a lie.

It's like a con job.

It's like Gavin Newsom.

He says how well he's doing in California, and

they're doing terribly.

Population is getting smaller.

People are leaving.

And other people are coming in.

And, you know, I wouldn't say it's an even trade.

While the other side is focused on playing games,

the Trump administration is focused on creating jobs,

bringing down prices.

And we've really brought them down a lot.

That's the other thing.

We're bringing down prices a lot.

We're bringing down grocery prices.

But the big thing is energy.

When you bring down energy, everything comes down.

And the energy prices are way down.

I see we're down to about $61 now.

Are you at a target now?

Yeah.

I saw yesterday when it hit like $90, $70.

I was just playing for a couple days with the Taylor Swift

release.

At some point in the pretty damn future.

It's very low, much lower than it was under Sleepy Joe.

And we're restoring law and order in our country.

We're restoring it here, but we're restoring it right now.

We're in Memphis.

We're going to Chicago.

We're making money.

Made some decent money on the Pepsi call, though.

Many governors are asking us to, including Democrats,

are trying to ask.

I don't know what the big problem is.

If I were a Democrat governor, I'd

be saying, whatever you can do to get crime down,

I'll take anybody.

You can bring them in any.

I don't care who it is.

A lot of people said that.

They interviewed women, these beautiful women in Chicago,

black women with a MAGA hat, a red hat.

They said, we don't care who he brings.

We don't care who he brings in here.

But this place is really dangerous.

We just want crime to stop.

It's true.

We don't care who we bring in here.

I don't differentiate between the National Guard and the Marines.

They don't care.

They'll take anybody.

And that's the way it is.

I mean, they want to see.

They want what we did in D.C.

They want to happen to them.

And it's happening in Memphis already.

I've just opened a position this past week.

In less than a week, the numbers are really good.

And it'll be great.

And we'll fix that.

We'll go to various other places.

And we're going to be stopping crime.

We're going to be stopping crime in our cities.

And that's a great thing.

And we won't get credit for it, but it's a great thing.

We've launched a historic campaign to take back our

nation from the gangs and the street criminals,

violent repeat offenders, illegal alien lawbreakers,

domestic extremists, and savage, bloodthirsty cartels.

And very little, by the way, is coming in by water,

in case you haven't known.

The drugs aren't coming in by water.

The President Trump You sold all your mirror yesterday?

The President Trump We can't even find any boats in the water anymore.

We had boats.

We were like a subway train with,

loaded up with drugs.

The President Trump I sold one mirror call yesterday.

The President Trump Every boat, every single boat

that you see getting taken out kills 25,000 Americans.

Think of that.

Because it's, you know, it's pretty tough stuff.

But it kills 25,000 Americans.

So when you hear that, it's no longer tough.

But here in Washington, we've deployed federal law

enforcement and National Guard to restore public safety.

And we're working to replicate that in numerous places

all over the country.

And we have a very powerful military.

We have a very powerful National Guard.

I want to thank the governor of Texas,

who has been, as usual, great.

Governor Abbott, he gave us 400 troops without even a question.

And we have other governors, likewise, doing what has to be done

because they know we have to confront crime.

We're directly confronting the sinister threat

of left-wing domestic terrorism and violence,

including the terrorist group Antifa.

You saw that yesterday.

We had a news conference.

Antifa is out of control.

They're in Portland and other places,

but mostly Portland in the case of Antifa.

And we had people that were really badly affected by them.

It was terrible.

So one of those things.

But we're knocking the hell out of them.

And we're looking for the people that are funding them.

And those people are going to be just as guilty as the people

that smack people over the head with a baseball bat.

The President Wait, what?

Governor Abbott And I'd like now to ask Attorney General

Bondi and Secretary Noem to discuss this a little bit

and tell where we are.

And then we'll go around the country.

The President We'll go around the room.

We'll go quickly.

We're going to go quickly if we can,

because we have a lot of things to do,

including I won't be spending that much time here

because I'll be leaving fairly soon for the Middle East.

And it's a very honor to be involved with that,

I'll tell you.

It's a great thing.

Great thing for our country.

People are so happy about it.

I've never experienced anything quite like it.

I've never seen such universal praise for being able

to do something.

The President Jesus Christ.

The President It's something that nobody thought was possible.

We're going to end up having peace in the Middle East.

Who would have thought?

So, Pam, could you start?

And then Christy, please.

The President I never thought somebody could out-glaze,

self-glaze Andrew Tate.

The President Sure, President Trump, and despite the

Democrats' shutdown of our government, our law enforcement officers are out there working

without patience.

The President Like, at some point, he should just have

surgery to remove his fucking ribs so he could just suck his own dick.

I mean, I'm being serious.

It's not even a political thing.

The President Secretary Hicks, Seth, and I were recently

in Memphis.

We had 1,100 law enforcement officers in one room with us.

The Memphis PD, they were the happiest to see us.

Don't you think, Seth?

Secretary Hicks, Seth?

Of anyone.

We had ATF, DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals.

I think, I'm not sure if our Park Police were there.

We had Treasury, Secretary Vesson, and of course, we had Secretary Nones, Homeland Security,

all working together with the Guard.

They were so happy to have us there.

We've been making arrests left and right.

So far, we've made five arrests.

We've made six arrests.

We've made six arrests.

We've made seven arrests.

We've made eight arrests.

We've made nine arrests.

We've made 10 arrests.

We've made 11 arrests.

We've made 12 arrests.

We've made 12 arrests.

We've made 12 arrests.

We've made 13 arrests.

We've made 14 arrests.

We've made 15 arrests.

We've made 16 arrests.

We've made 15 arrests.

We've made 14 arrests.

We've made 12 arrests.

We've made 13 arrests.

We've made 15 arrests with the Guard.

They were so happy to have us there.

We've been making arrests left and right.

So far, we've made 562 arrests and seized 144 illegal guns, just in the short time we've

been in Memphis.

SENATOR COONS, And many of these people are career criminals.

And when you take them out of a place, your crime rate just goes down.

These people commit crimes every single day.

They're sick.

And we're taking them out.

In some cases, we're bringing them back to their countries.

Biden allowed with his stupid open borders that we had in our country to

come in but they're being burnt back to other places or they're being put in

jail but they're career criminals. President Trump last night alone we made

91 arrests, 19 firearms off the streets and one was a warrant for a

homicide and four sex offenders who had active warrants. One was a sex offender

on a child. Everything we did in Memphis was worth it in my opinion for that one

arrest. Think about that. We got a child rapist off the streets but yet we've

made 562 arrests and still going strong in Memphis. Just what we did in DC but

it's because it's all of us as a team working for you to make America safe

all together. Round the clock. Thank you very much. Thank you Pam, you're doing a great job and it's amazing that we're not

getting cooperation from Democrats. It's like, it's a new issue you know.

Thank you very much. Thank you Pam, you're doing a great job and it's amazing that we're not getting cooperation from Democrats. It's like, it's a new issue you know.

Thank you Pam, you're doing a great job and it's amazing that we're not getting cooperation from Democrats. It's like, it's a new issue you know. We have all the old issues of the wall

and the border and all of the things of men playing in women's sports who they

still want that transgender for everybody. All these issues are so crazy

but we haven't know what it's called crime. We stop crime and they allow crime.

They want crime. It doesn't make sense. I think it's as ridiculous as the

other things that we talk about all the time but I've added it on to our list a

five-letter word called crime.

We stop it and they actually incite it.

I'm not gonna lie I had to double-check that there was five letters in it just

because of him saying that.

All of the people, if we needed the military, people would be there. We've got a massive military. We have the best numbers we've ever had for recruitment.

Oh come on Bill, really?

We have a lot of people now. We have people that can't get into them. In a great economy, they want to be soldiers again. A year ago they didn't want to even think about it.

Same thing is with police and firemen, everything. They want to

they want to join. They're proud of our country again. Christy, go ahead please.

Well sir, thank you for your leadership for deploying all of our local police and firemen.

All right Mr. Martinez, dumb fucking decision on your point dropping that word even if it got

auto-modded. Listen, I get that we make a lot of jokes here but we're not gonna

drop that word in my channel so goodbye. Okay, I don't care. We're not, we don't do

that. We don't, we don't, we don't say that shit here so get fucked dude. Yeah, I

don't care. I don't care how upset you are. You don't

like that. What I'm also doing sir is, and with your authority, is we're

purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of. We're gonna not back off.

No, I'm sorry. I don't care. I don't care. We don't, it doesn't matter.

Chicago in response to the people there and then I was there a few days ago and

looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of. I'm sorry, I don't care. Because what they're trying to do with these

riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those. Nah, you're

not, you're not gonna drop a word like that

on these gay people. I don't care. What they went out and back on Tuesday and met

with the Governor, met with the Mayor, met with the Chief of Police and the

Superintendent of the Highway Patrol. That just crosses from being edgy to being

hateful. They are all lying and disingenuous and dishonest people because as soon as you leave the room. Very tough to fucking cross lines here but

yeah. They make the exact opposite response so we're looking at new facilities to

purchase. They're in Portland too and we're gonna double down and I told them

if they didn't meet our demands for safety and security

on the streets and work with us then we were going to bring in more federal law enforcement so i want

to thank pete and the department of war for all their help they've been fantastic but while we

fight litigation and work with pam on that we're going to send more of our resources and men and

women out there to keep everybody safe so as a gay person i prefer the term cocksucker any

any day of the week okay that's fine i don't mind somebody saying that but you have to purposely

and the numbers in memphis it's only you know what i mean like you're only dropping that

i'm not trying like i said i'm not trying to be uh fantastic and it shows what a partnership can

be between local law enforcement and the federal government stickler but there's certain things i

just don't want to do in chicago we will but but the people demand and president trump my lawyers

are in court right now as we speak for you arguing in chicago and portland to keep them safe to bring

in the guard the government doesn't want it there but we do

we're

we're

going to keep their citizens safe thanks there's nothing wrong with being a you know i don't

understand the politics of it i don't understand why a pritzker is trying to protect people that

are they're more scared of the anarchists that are on the street and the politics of it than

they are of no i'm not your fucking ally either i'm just i'm just you know what i mean like i'm

just it's just it's just the right people there's no other reason my channel i keep it how i want it

possible that they don't want to have a safe chicago and we can solve i'm not your enemy

either i'm just i'm not i'm not i'm not

i'm not i i don't have a fucking title is what i'm saying we're doing it anyway so thanks i i asked the mayor that himself he said that you're not an ally you hate gay people oh my god

perfectly safe a beautiful city you know i'm neutral why did you clear this for me today i want you to be you it makes you happy and it doesn't hurt anybody else you be you okay and these people on the streets none of my goddamn business there's graffiti that says molotovs melt silence is violence i just banned somebody's gift shit we're going to use them

it's almost different it's like anarchists i'm like switcheroo

i'm going to say i'm going to stay neutral and collect your money but those are anarchists those

are people that want to overthrow government they're really degenerates and we're finding

out who is supplying all of those beautiful signs and everything else that's been fantastic his team

finding the financial networks is great that's that's what gives everybody that's easy it's a

frog right stocky okay chill we got a great team sir that's good how about we go to marco you can

talk a little bit about i'm

so i understand about both sides okay wait what you know i don't know the one day perhaps the

entire story will be told about the events of yesterday but i suffice it to say it's not an

exaggeration that none of it would have been possible without the president of the united

states being involved wait what happened it really began with your trip to the middle east

where these relationships were forged with partners in the region personal relationships

close relationships that created the foundation where all this was possible

where it really took a turn remember a month ago i never thought this was possible

where it really took a turn about a month ago hey bourbons don't push it bro don't push it

is when we were at the united nations and you convened a historic meeting not simply of arab

countries but muslim majority countries from around the world including indonesia was there

pakistan was there and created this coalition behind this plan you then on that following

monday you met with the prime minister of israel here and that plan was presented and then of course

our great negotiating team followed up on that and then of course we had a meeting with the

president of israel in the interim um again perhaps the stories will be told perhaps they

will never be told the president had some this is more glazing than a bonnie blue video meetings

that required a high degree of intensity and commitment and made this happen and i think

what's important to understand is that yesterday what happened was really a human story there's a

geopolitical aspect to it there's no doubt about it it creates the conditions for gaza to one day

be a normal place again and people are going to be able to do that and i think that's what's

important to understand is that yesterday was a human story and because of the work you put it and

honestly there is no not only is there no other leader in the world oh no this is going to last

two hours we're not watching frankly i don't know of any american president in the modern era that

could have made this possible because of the actions you have taken unrelated to this and

because of who you are and what you've done and how you're viewed and this weekend because of that

at some point very soon we are going to see 20 living human beings emerge from the darkness into

the first time in two years and that is because not only were you you used the credibility and

the power and the prestige would you fight a gorilla to be the last dude for bonnie blue

is that that weird looking british chick i wouldn't fight a fucking ferret to be first

our country should be very proud of that we have a president that's committed to the not just peace

but to the human aspect of reuniting these families i'm sorry i don't know where that

came from a couple days ago secretary hosted us all many of us

at the kennedy center and we have these families we've interacted them for so many years for some

for two years now yes i have been involved in a train when i you know what you know let me just

let's just move on i'm gonna stop reading chat because this complete the process of grieving

and uh it was uh we had all hoped that perhaps that was the day that we would have an announcement

for them on the anniversary of the seventh but i know you were able to speak to some of those

families last night and and i just hope the whole no i was third in line

okay i'm gonna go

their country for the role that they played and i don't want to let this moment pass mr president

without also noting the incredible work of steve woodcoff and jared jared kushner they're an

incredible team working together facing some substantial impediments to even being there

this weekend and doing it suffice let me just leave it at that and they've done a great job

on your behalf mr president they deserve a tremendous amount of credit but thank you for

what you've done here for the world for the world thank you very much i appreciate it i think because

i have a very busy day with all that's going on what we'll do is maybe just uh a few of you raise

your hand if you'd like to say something oh they're giving themselves an out don't talk too

long he's doing such a great job so good that he can talk all day that's the problem right but uh

you know and what we'll do is just take a few hands and then we'll go back to getting peace done

okay we'll go a little bit quicker we'll take a few questions from the press president trump i just

wanted to i just wanted to to just kind of make a correction to what marco was sharing

such a remarkable accomplishment agree that no other president could have done this but what

set the groundwork for you able to do that when you took office on january 20th you made 180

degree turn in our military strength uh with pete's leadership uh you you were the masterclass

in peace through strength so militarily we've completely turned around we've demonstrated that

through execution against iran and others uh that we have force we want to end wars but we just have to

we just have to have peace and just keep active and we just have to keep ourselves in the situation

but we'll use power if we have to and then secondarily that peace through

strength is also the prosperity having the strongest economy and we'll be

willing to wield the power of a tariff in addition I just got here can somebody

give me a synopsis of what we talked about so far yeah quickest way to

describe it is that's pretty much it that's that's basically what we've

missed the entire time I'm serious and that was 180 you return on energy you

have used energy diplomacy to bring prosperity of the American people and

you've used it to bring peace abroad and the combination of those three things

have been remarkable and now we're seeing the remarkable result and we got

one more that I know you want to end with Russia and Ukraine energy is going

to play a key role in that and now what do you think the best brokerage to start

day trading I don't like that answer whatever and I don't think you should

date right unless you got everything else under under control but if you want

to do a

just find whatever you feel is the best UI for you and you can just what he said

about the military how well we're doing and how big it is and how strong it is

mr. president you're exactly right at the War Department you don't get peace

without strength and our job is to be the strength part of the equation and

deliver that when necessary as you demonstrated with your order of

midnight-hammer and the entire world saw and I just isn't against TOS to watch

someone suck another guy's dick live no personal honor to be able to leave

this the way you lead and this is I wish people had a full understanding what

that yes but that that historic nature I a lot of us vets you know the vice

president Tulsi Lee Doug probably after decades of war the chaos that was

unleashed through reckless and foolish American policies never thought this

kind of peace would be possible yet with your strength with your ability to with

your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your

strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength with your ability to with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a

relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a relationship with your strength Jesus Christ it's like they're in a

ready war department in the world, which is true, which is why you've seen, we saw record recruitment

in 2025, Mr. President. The first two weeks of 2026 already blows that out. FY 2026 already

blows it out of the water. In fact, re-enlistment has already met its year-long goal in the Marine

Corps in 2026. You can't, there's no other way to create that kind of enthusiasm than with your

leadership, sir, and it is an honor to work with Pam and with Christine and the cities across the

country to make sure American citizens and law enforcement are protected with our National Guard,

but that's a core mission. And last thing, Mr. President, on the southwest border, the first

group that rotated in to lock down that border to zero crossings is now rotating out, and with a

new border medal, the Southwest Border Medal, or it's actually called the Mexican Border Medal,

revived from 1918, that will be pinning on their chest. So thank you, FOOMS, for renaming the

new medal.

I kind of live up to it every day. Thank you, sir.

I mean, think of this. We have record numbers of recruits.

I wonder whatever happened to my medals. I don't know where they're probably lost to somewhere.

So we couldn't get anybody to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard,

my beautiful, I call it our beautiful Space Force. I love our Space Force. It's turned out

to be very important, but we couldn't get anybody to join. Nobody wanted to join, including our

police and fire. They didn't want to join anything.

Your wife gave them to the kids to play with? Okay, that's just, that's fucking bad.

So we couldn't get anybody. And now we have, we're brimming. Now it's, and they're getting

in based on merit now. A soldier's a soldier. They come in now based on merit, not based

on woke stuff that anybody can qualify. You have to qualify for jobs. You have to qualify

for certain types of jobs. And it's amazing. So we were embarrassed a year ago. Think of

it, a little bit more than a year ago. A year ago. I think it stopped on November 5th. I

think it really started, this all started on November 5th, the election, election day.

But now everybody wants to be in. We have an overabundance and maybe we should raise it a

little bit. I don't know. I like that idea, sir. But we could raise it, but we have so many people

want to join and they're proud of our country again. JD, could I ask you? Yes, sir. So just a

couple of things. Mr. President, first of all, congratulations on yesterday. It was a big day

to Marco, to Susie, to the entire team. But I got to move off this. It's going to be all day

from this perspective where

for months, the fake news media attacked you, attacked the entire team, attacked your

approach. You know, the definition of insanity is to do the same thing again and again, expecting

a different result. The reason we're here is because the president actually charted a different

course. Because people did the same thing. He vested a lot of authority in Steve Woodcock in

particular. And that's why we're here. It's because you did something different. And I think

it's important to recognize that. I also think the president, you know, Marco mentioned the

president's personal touch being a big part of this. What I would say is, is obviously the

United States, a New York real estate billionaire, one of the most famous New Yorkers in the world,

has a lot of interaction with a lot of people who are very pro-Israel. I think that was an

important set of experiences and life experiences that he brought to the table. He also, of

course, knew one of the most famous Palestinians in the world, Chuck Schumer. And I think without

that background of knowledge, it would have been impossible to get us to this moment.

Second thing I would say, just on Chuck Schumer, the president mentioned this, that Chuck Schumer said, this is a

program we're already in.

This has been good for us this morning about the shut down. One of the things we talked by before

the media came in and that all of us have been working on for the rest of the day, how to make

the shut down as painless as possible on the American people.

So while Chuck Schumer brags about this being good, and I think the president is right, it's

causing consequences for the American people.

There's a low-income food program, the cultural health

program that my mom actually was in when I was a kid. That program is about to be underfunded.

That will happen when the United States has a nationalodality bill. It's going to be the fundamental

thing of the LAPD campaign. I mean, I heat Hmong, for instance, fornadal food rights, because that'd be

going up for good for us. You know that and undiitus opportunities that aren't going over the joint

and it's about to get cut off because Chuck Schumer won't open the government.

We have troops. The Secretary of War mentioned how what we're doing on

recruitment. We're trying to figure out how to pay our troops because Chuck

Schumer is shutting down the US government. There are veterans benefits

that are going to suffer. There are Americans that are going to suffer

because Chuck Schumer refuses to do his job. So while we're all celebrating this

incredible success that we've had on the world stage, the country could

be doing so much better if Chuck Schumer did his job and opened the government.

Every single Republican, except for Rand Paul, has voted to open the government. A

few moderate Democrats, to their credit, have voted with us to open the

government. We just need five more Democrats to come to their senses and

let the people's government serve the American people. I hope that they'll do

that. Thank you, sir. Yeah, to follow up on that point, Mr. President, the

Democrat or Schumer shutdown did not begin eight or nine days

ago. It began eight or nine months ago. Is it an orgy if everyone is blowing one guy?

You've clearly never been to an orgy. Every Senate-confirmed appointee who are

our deputies to run our department, every one of them has been filibustered. One of the

critical parts of my department is the National Nuclear Security Administration.

It maintains, manufactures our nuclear weapons and our engines for nuclear

submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers. We are a key supplier to

Secretary of War Pete Hagseth.

They filibustered the Democrats, filibustered the leader, the

administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, would not let him

come into my department until the Republicans, two weeks ago, changed the

Senate rules so they could confirm him and we could have a leader. They

filibustered the leadership, now they're filibustering the funding. In the next

six, seven days, we're gonna run out of funding and the retooling of our nuclear

stockpile, the ultimate guarantor of our sovereignty, is going to be

underfunded and we're gonna have to slow down and creep to a scroll these efforts.

Just incredibly irresponsible.

A lot of glazing, I'm just gonna move off of this here.

I'm gonna move off of this, there's just a lot of glazing right here. Wow, it actually followed the line.

It was a little bit weird the way it went, but it actually followed the median line.

That's actually kind of cool. I don't know why they keep following the lines.

Oh my god, CRM is still going. If any of you guys are still into calls from yesterday,

we caught the absolute bottom of the bottom on that dip and we got it, we fucking nailed it.

Even though, um,

even though the market's red, it's fucking still going, so that's kind of cool, um, seeing that happen.

When is MNTS gonna move? I don't know. Um, this is one of those ones I'm kind of willing to hold some of it overnight.

I like this NASA deal. Last time they got a NASA deal, they jumped and then, uh, they fell back down and then they took a couple days until they mooned.

So, you know, I don't want to tie up too much capital overnight. If the stop losses hit, they do, but I might re-enter. I don't know. We'll see.

Um, but it's not working out so hot right now. It's really, it's really not.

It's, uh, started pre-market, had a nice spike, didn't sell, and then I just, uh, bought a hundred shares each, uh, each on the way down.

And now I'm sitting on, uh, the ones I got left here with the stop losses. I don't know. We'll see.

CRM's been killing it. Um, the other ones from this morning did really well as well, but, uh, MNTS just isn't working yet.

Um, did I get out of Verizon? I've up and down traded it, but, uh, I'm, uh, I'm still in it.

Um, because I, I still want to see if, uh, there's a bounce back, if there's any rotation.

It's not happening yet. I told you guys I would decide by tomorrow what I'm doing with them.

Uh, we got out of Klarna for a huge gain this morning out of nowhere.

The NNE calls overnight absolutely fucking banked, and I think we sold the top this morning.

Uh, AHR is down today. I did average down on that. I took a Joby position.

Um, sold another Fly this morning.

Uh, yesterday I sold one MIR.

Sold one Kodak this morning.

Took the money and bought Helen of Troy. So that's, that's kind of what I've done right now.

Okay, um, what the fuck is this?

So, apparently...

So, Twitter...

Twitch got away with the bounty board, which never really worked for me.

Because it was always, like, for gaming.

And even though at my, my, my viewership level I'd make, like, you know, two, three thousand dollars an hour playing the game.

Uh, it wouldn't really count because I wouldn't, because people don't watch me play games.

They kind of leave when I do.

So I never took those, but they did give me, like, little, like, uh, you know, movie trailers.

And it would pay me, like, a hundred, two hundred bucks to play it on stream.

So they got rid of the bounty board, and they said, we're getting rid of the bounty board.

We're bringing in a sponsorship thing.

Right?

And so, they brought in this sponsorship thing.

And apparently you have a sponsorship profile.

And you guys saw what it was last time.

Right?

I haven't done anything to it.

They only have my category, my featured clips.

Okay.

That's not probably the best one.

So this is how they find you.

That is it.

It is Friday.

Get ready.

Okay.

Um.

We should probably work on some new featured clips.

What is this one?

She thinks I need to get rid of these.

Okay?

I, I, I've had these for about fifteen years.

I wear boxer briefs.

And after fifteen years, sometimes the structural integrity isn't what it used to be.

Okay?

Alright.

So sometimes the structural integrity isn't quite what it used to be.

Okay?

And, and so, so.

You know.

It.

Things happen.

Okay?

Things happen.

Alright?

But.

But.

Okay?

But before I get rid of these.

You're a grown ass adult.

Jesus.

First of all, I don't wear them.

I mostly just kept them.

Because it bothered her.

But every guy has, has a pair of holy underwear.

Um.

Okay.

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

You know what?

Okay.

You know what?

The point was, that I was getting at.

You used to wipe the, wipe the board.

I know, but that wasn't part of the bit.

The bit was funny.

I just didn't think it was going to be on my fucking sponsorship page.

Regardless.

Regardless.

So apparently, uh.

I have not checked for sponsorships, um.

That's the reason why Sarah sent you the erasers.

I know.

Don't ruin the bit.

So apparently, there is a sponsorship page.

And that is your creator profile.

And they can find you on that.

And it gives you this stuff right here.

right like it gives you it gives you this i have never really looked at it until today

so apparently it tells you average viewership 2000 average web half i have one of the highest

web viewers too because people are at work web ios android and whatever the fuck this is other

hours watched okay viewership channels tells you male female unknown okay all right my uh

my millennial ladies i see you um so it gives you that right so now that they know that you get

sponsorship offers apparently okay um you get uh you get uh you get non-buying or sorry unknown

equals d slash gens so i was like you know what i'm gonna go look i've never had a sponsorship

offer before on this little page i'm gonna go check it right now and i have two sponsorship

offers they're just generalized ones

but hey let's see how this is playing out on the bounty board generally if a game wanted to do a

sponsorship or a bounty they offered usually at my viewership level around one to two thousand

dollars per hour okay let's go let's see what we got all right we got two games puzzles and chaos

they're gonna pay me ten dollars dynasty legends seventy two dollars all right maybe that's just

wrong maybe that's the base pay for smaller streamers so i i guess that's just wrong

let me just double check here offer for the stock guy ten dollars guaranteed base with a

cool guy god damn you fell off yeah matter of fact i'm buddies with everybody at stream elements

including the founder i'm gonna tell this i'm gonna send this to them i'm gonna dm this i'm

gonna tell them to fuck themselves like in a fun way are we getting that whiteboard before you go

yeah yeah yeah give me a second they just got more free marketing from you showing this and

they would have if you played it okay that's fair but effed up all right whatever okay so um

by the way guys um wait this actually ties into what i was gonna do a whiteboard on

this is from this morning okay damn well not the first time something from japan has hit the

illusion islands ayo this is gonna work all right here you go all right so earlier we were talking

somebody said something about um prisoners and and and prisoner swaps and and and stuff like that

and encampments and stuff like that and it reminded me of something and actually this actually funny

enough actually i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know

actually perfectly ties into it all right so let's do it all right let me tell you all about

something so i said during that i said how come nobody talks about the time all the inuits

became prisoners and somebody said stocky what and then somebody said stocky we've been finding

them in the catholic schools no not what i'm talking about okay that's that's it's totally

different thing there i gotta tell you all about this because a lot of people don't know history

okay a lot of people don't know history so i feel like this was a fun little not a fun little but a

little uh whiteboard to do because i feel like a bunch of people may not be completely aware of

what happened and uh you know what why not let's do a little history whiteboard uh because uh it's

it's kind of relevant and i think it'd be really cool to talk about because i feel like history

is really interesting especially i find the things i find the most is history about things

the u.s government intentionally hid from its people in order to drive a narrative okay

i'm not about to do some like conspiracy theory thing it's just about things that were found out

later that that the government purposely hid and that most people don't know about because of that

okay all right so let's do this like the epstein files i knew it was coming it actually took longer

than i thought here we go so we're often told that the united states has only been invaded

once right since it became uh a uh you know a country right war of 1812 all right and

you're all been lied to we burned your white house down eh sorry about that no you guys didn't

do shit you were a bunch of fucking fucking beaver fucking fur trader shitheads who got used by the

british to fucking go around the the great lakes to come down to to dc okay you you guys didn't do

shit okay you guys we i we we burned down your white house hey i'm sorry about that no you didn't

fucking burn shit you fucking birch you fucking beaver trapping fucking fur traders

nobody you weren't shit okay you were you were you were you were you were so you weren't even

i'm sorry i'm gonna get on to it right okay so here's my thing all right um and you got you got

taken over by a bunch of drunk irish guys from new york city and held ransom for the to the uk

in in exchange for ireland being fucking uh uh you know freed or whatever and then they realized that

this wasn't going to work out as well as they thought they got sober and they left but moving

on okay all right so

this is not true the united states has been invaded one other time before since then okay

and they don't teach you this in history they don't tell you this in history class okay and

that's right two things you may not know number one is that the japanese actually killed american

civilians in mainland america okay and that is because during world war ii japan decided to use

the fucking jet stream

and they took a whole bunch of balloons with rockets on them and they sent them up into the

jet stream hoping that it would eventually come to america and a whole bunch of them didn't make

it they fell in the ocean they drifted off they they fell out of that but a couple of them made

them and one of them actually fell in the pacific northwest and it fell on the ground and a family

picnicking found it and it exploded and they died interesting enough but that's not what i want to

talk about today okay i want to talk about the time japan invaded the united states that's right

japan invaded the united states during world war ii so y'all have heard of uh the uh 1942 you heard

of the battle of midway right all right big big one they did a movie with uh one of the jonas

brothers was a terrible fucking movie but it was a cool cool piece of history battle of midway this

was the turning point of the uh of the of the of the japan the

japanese and the american battle for the pacific right i mean some people will say iwo jima was or

this was but midway was really the turning point right and it was a it was a monster battle okay

it was a monster naval battle air battle everything like that well the japanese wanted to divert some

of our fleet from midway and from that from that you know expansion so they thought that they were

going to uh that they were going to cause a distraction right so how could they how could

they cause a big distraction right well

well how would they do that well first you had the bombing of dutch harbor we'll talk about that

another time but i want to talk about the invasion of atu this is actually a really cool piece of

history now the reason that you don't hear about this is that the united states government never

talked about it because they never wanted the public to know that japan actually landed troops

in and by the way alaska wasn't a state yet it was a territory but it was still american it was

still a part of america um they didn't want to they didn't want the public to know about japan

having an invasion and and and you know ground combat and hand-to-hand fighting in the united

states on united states territory right like they didn't want that to be a part of it remember fdr and

his administration actually pulled the s the ftc uh or they weren't back to ftc back then but they

actually pulled the permits and licenses of a lot of uh radio stations and tv stations who did not

agree to do to broadcast only what the government said that they could do this is a true story

they actually they actually

pulled their permits and their licensing and wouldn't let them have their licenses to broadcast

if it wasn't what was approved by the government and this was part of it right again just and some

people say ends justify the means different conversation but the invasion of atu so in 1942

the japanese decided we need a distraction we need to pull the u.s forces away from midway so

how do we do that we go all the way the fuck up to alaska okay all the way up to alaska okay

and they go there and

2500 japanese imperial army troops i'll just call it troops okay land okay they land there

and they go to one of the lucian islands now the crazy thing was is that they actually there was

actually no military base there there was no u.s military base on the island okay there there was

there was no military uh presence there but there were a bunch of people who were there and they

were a bunch of inuit people that lived there okay like civilians because remember this was this was

like a few years after we bought it from russia okay so or a few years it's been a while since

there but like you know it still wasn't a state and we didn't really do anything yet so like there

were just a bunch of random fucking inuit people that were on this island that were just hanging

out one day and this giant force landed on the island okay landed on the island and they captured

like 42 or upwards of 42 people and they were like oh my god they're like oh my god they're

50 of these civilians and immediately interned them looking these guys had nothing to do with

this they weren't americans they weren't citizens they were just a bunch of what we call we used to

call eskimos before it was like inappropriate but inuits just hanging out one day you know

eating some seal or some shit and the japanese got them and interned them and like most of them

fucking died right like from disease and and and malnutrition and some of them for torture

had nothing to do with it but they just did they didn't want them running off and alerting anybody

okay so they do this

all right and now all of a sudden the japanese have this this island so for those you guys who

know alaska right you've got this this big land then you got the little thing and you got the

islands so they land on atu over here well here's the problem normally you wouldn't give a shit

but guess what the japanese were quick in building air bases and airstrips on islands

and so with the with with the the the occupation of this island not only did they land on american

soil

but they could set up an air base that could actually because they probably thought they

were going to get resistance they actually can set up an air base to attack you know the west

coast without having to cross the entire ocean right pretty pretty pretty concerning if you're

if you're the american military okay so eventually the u.s of course they knew this was happening

they quietly built bases a couple islands over because japan had landed there without like a

real big plan and they weren't like doing a whole bunch of recon but they started setting up these

small bases they're like oh we're gonna do this we're gonna do this we're gonna do this we're gonna

do this we're gonna do this we're gonna oh shit we gotta we gotta do something right we gotta we

gotta take care of this like we can't just let this go unanswered but we don't want to start

anything okay and what they ended up doing is is they started doing air raids on this japanese base

on atu and so they started bombing them and started shooting at them and they did some

underwater like submarine shit where they were like cutting off uh uh you know setting up things

where there wouldn't be any supplies coming so now the japanese realize that like this isn't

going to be easy but japanese are are were wild when it came to this stuff like they were like

fighting for the last bit of air and they were like fighting for the last bit of air and they

man fight to the death no honor or no shame no honor kind of thing right so then in my and was

it uh march i think march of the following year 1943 that's when the battle happens okay and it

was the battle of the comma i can't say it comma kamadosky kamadorsky something like that islands

right like they've got this battle happening right and and it was you know the last major

daytime surface ship battle of the war right like it's like the after after this like because

they'd already you know midway whatever but we had to take care of this okay and at what the

reason that this was so intense was because now because the u.s forces overwhelmed them the only

way the japanese soldiers on this island could actually get supplies was via submarine because

of this battle so now they're getting cut off okay okay i know i'm taking too long on this but

it's such a cool piece of news

of history okay it's just a cool piece of history okay uh if you guys want me to if you want me to

i'll wrap it up i'll wrap it up okay so this is the fun part so we're not fun part the crazy part

so now here we go we've got this happening okay then in may the battle of atu island happens

history didn't teach you this shit okay because they didn't want you to know about japan doing

this so in may of 43 okay the battle of atu island occurs the battle of atu island occurs it it was

like i said history doesn't teach you

stuff okay 11 000 u.s troops okay 11 000 u.s troops from the 7th infantry uh and crazy enough

some canadians a right because remember canada was on our side and like this was the closest they

were like we actually had canadians that helped us with this canada i know they didn't probably

didn't teach you this either but americans from the 7th infantry and and canadians decide that

it is time right and so they land on atu island

okay but it was completely fucking covered in fog and the island is muddy because remember it's just

rain sleet snow and and and and and cold and fog right because it's in that in that weird area up

there completely covered in fog nobody can see shit nobody can see shit and it's muddy and then

it's quiet and so the american troops start like moving through the island and then they hear these

right these war cries okay and that's when they did their bonsai charges and their bonsai charges

were like ground versions of kamikaze you know fighters like they just charge fucking bayonets

shooting and everything like that and just try to over just fear an overwhelming force and just

charge the americans right and it it didn't work out for them i mean it was pretty brutal i mean

it was it was pretty brutal it was it was it was it was a very very bloody battle and the

japanese were outnumbered so they did a lot of damage but well based on attrition the american

military just repelled them and over three weeks that that happened okay um the only thing was is

that the americans ended up winning this but they didn't realize it was over right they didn't

realize it was over the japanese ended up retreating in that fog and all that shit okay

and so like they they don't know that the japanese have retreated

so the u.s had lost a few troops but they did pretty good considering those bonsai attacks

but then the ghost battle happened here's the crazy part okay i know i i'm taking too long okay

i'm taking too long but but listen this is fun this is fun well it's like cool piece of history

so a ghost battle happened now what this was remember the whole thing i did on the on the on

the the the the karen seppi battle similar thing here they're they're doing their patrols and

someone like pops off a shot they're like oh my god they're like oh my god they're like oh my god

or yells or something like that and they were they had gotten separated and they thought it was

the japanese but it was each other and so they ended up you know they ended up and this was this

was in uh uh the uh you know it's a different island called kisaki or something like that

there were 34 000 troops okay u.s and canadian and it was abandoned because they the japanese

had disappeared right there was like 5 000 troops there they disappeared in the fog two weeks before

they landed on this island and that's where the ghost battle happened like they didn't

know that they were gone and they thought they were fighting them so but that's when the japanese

left so so most of the casualties for this in the u.s were there there's also a story of a guy named

private martinez so there was this guy who was a u.s guy and uh during these attacks he uh he he

left his uh his his regiment or whatever and fucking just bull rushed they called him the

bull of otto or whatever bull rushed a japanese um machine gun nest and fucking hand-to-hand

combat and wiped everybody out and allowed a lot of this to happen but so basically that was it

so basically this was a battle and a campaign that was fought in in secrecy on an island off of

alaska okay naval battle submarines fucking you know secret air bases all right fought in the fog

winds of a hundred miles an hour freezing cold temperatures and it was the summer okay and it's

called the forgotten battle but it was forgotten on purpose and the crazy thing about it was is

that it was a war and it was a war and it was a war but it turned out that this caused japan to have to

divert their resources and actually led to even more expedited um uh u.s force takeover in the

pacific theater all because of this one small battle okay and the one thing i will say about it

is that the real people who got screwed on this okay all right the real people that got screwed

on this were the uh were the local um

inuits okay so casualties the japanese i mean there's no like there's no like guarantee like

no because there was a lot of unknowns that happened there but for japan japan they lost

about 2 500 troops okay um and uh obviously they lost some of their their their their ships and

stuff like that during the naval battles um the united states oh japan also had about about i

think something like 500 people captured uh the u.s had a lot of wounded

outside of their own um outside of their own that that ghost battle okay but most of them

were from uh frostbite okay so they had like 1100 wounded of course the u.s like i said we probably

had u.s more u.s killed but they kept it quiet for a long time so we'll never really know

but uh there were like 1200 like severe cold and flu symptoms uh 600 people got like exposure

problems and then 28 to 35 people got like a hundred people got like a hundred people got like a hundred

people killed in the ghost battle but the real like oh they also lost 600 people i should say

600 people let's just again 600 killed i don't want to give the number because i don't really

feel like we really get it but there were 600 americans the u.s lost 600 kia okay so japanese

lost 2500 had 500 captured uh the u.s had 600 kia 1100 wounded and obviously the ghost battle

but the civilians that was the messed up part okay that was the messed up part

the fucking guys who were just hanging out on this island eating fucking seal and shit

got captured interned by the japanese 16 of them died while in captivity okay but

that wasn't they weren't the most egregious 880 of them were evacuated by the u.s into

guess what the japanese internment camps sorry it's not

funny but it was fucked up they had nowhere to put them they had nowhere to put them

they had nowhere to put them so they evacuated them and and and and put them in term encampments

and then barred from ever returning back to their island i'm not making this up this is the worst

part of the story these guys were hanging out on an island one day nowhere fucking alaska nowhere

near japan the united states had nothing to do with this next thing you know japanese troops land

take your take a bunch of people and turn them for whatever fucking reason right then there's a

bunch of japanese fighting and americans fighting and stuff like that americans end up winning then

they take you off your island fly you into an put can put you in an internment camp and then bar you

from ever going home so if you ever wonder why any any you know native population of any place ever

questions united states about relocation okay and canadians all right imagine you're just enjoying

penguin meat on your island then you get sniped and you're like oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna

get sniped so so yeah i i probably went too far on this but it's a pretty cool piece of history

right that's a pretty cool i mean it's not cool like as in like oh yeah awesome cool but like

this is shit they don't teach you about they don't they don't want you to know that japan

actually ground invasion on the united states on this island there was actually its major battle

they want to divert u.s resources turns out we diverted their own there was two battles there

was like a ghost battle there was submarines and shit like that like whatever like that

that's that's just like a cool little thing all right what was the moral of the story

never trust a government that wants to help you out if they say i'm from the government and i'm

here to help i don't know it's just a plot of happy feet three no do you ever get good faith

violations or do you only trade with settled cash i have more than 25k so i can date trade

um mnts really taking its time this morning yeah it's like it's like last time although

last time we had at least one bump before end of day before it waited like a week for the pop

so i don't know man it's a different market things change just get naked old man oh shit it is wait

hey babe aren't you taking her to oh okay take a nap i'm about to get naked anyways

our econ professor is doing history again for some reason you make history

enjoyable well no history is not enjoyable i know that that's not sir that wasn't an

enjoyable story i don't i don't really know i mean unless you unless you like

you know or have money or property on that island because of the you know i don't really know

i should tell you about the story of king kamehameha and how he unified the the hawaiian

empire and then queen lily okalani and how the government promised them a bunch of shit and then

fucking went back on it and basically took hawaii by threat of force queen lily okalani uh reference

well i mean i grew up in hawaii so we obviously knew who kamehameha and and leo

lani was um and they have statues and like hilo bay and shit like that we're not loving america

today i'm not listen it's this isn't an anti-american stream i love how you just tell

history and people are like you didn't make it sound all pro-american you must hate america i'm

like no i'm just telling you what we did you can decide what the fuck you feel about that i mean

fuck maybe the inuits had it coming to them a bunch of fucking fucking blubber eating fucking

environmental terrorists okay up there clubbing fucking

baby seals all right if anybody needed to go into a fucking internment camp it was the goddamn

eskimos okay that's right i said it all right fuck them all right you ever seen a baby seal

they're adorable now imagine somebody beating one of those to death that's right you'd want

them camp internment camp wouldn't you yeah exactly fuck the inuits fucking maybe maybe

you should have invented some fucking firearms or invented some shit instead of fucking sitting on

your igloos all goddamn day that's right we did you didn't get wrecked fucker like is that what

i say like i don't i don't get the whole like what what what what you want me to do here like

that's just what happened man you're right they could have put shot callers on them oh my god

on the inuits or the seals oh you know i don't care you guys are so in this shit right now

the fact that i have to learn from you guys about the shit that's going on and on twitch and the

fact that i know everyone who tells me about it is either convinced 100 they're right about

whichever thing they got i don't want to be involved in it honestly i don't want to be

involved in it honestly i'm i'm only here for the history uh segments yo jay what's up buddy

yo stevie two raids coming in what's going on guys how y'all doing have you considered having a baby

on stream no but i heard somebody did uh have a baby fandy had a baby on stream and i i already

said my piece about it like it is what it is like i mean you know it as long as they didn't you know

show the actual thing i mean it it is what it is like i mean i i don't know if it's not against

and you know people people want to watch it and twitch is it is what it is you know what i mean

like and and i hear people say well think of the kids i'm like they watch this i'm like yeah but

you don't say that when like your favorite gamer is like dropping fucking slurs and fucking

shit in the lobby of their game you know i mean like you don't really care

but that being said congratulations to them and i am now going to be um because they said it's

been well documented uh it's not the first time a birth has been done on camera and it's not been

documented and what like that i am thinking let's push the envelope instead of having the first

live stream birth i want to do the first live stream insemination if you know what i mean

which is something that's also been documented and filmed and and studied okay it is the beginning

of life okay so okay it's just porn and you're a bigot are you gatekeeping a very important thing

okay i'm not here to fucking be everyone's everyone's you know daddy i mean i'll be your

daddy i'm just kidding i have no dog in the fight i didn't um uh when are you taking your shirt off

literally like in two minutes dog in the fight good one no no no no no no no no no that's not

a that's not a no pun intended there okay bye yeah no problem are you still in aehr yes i am

um aehr last time we took puts through earnings and took all the profits from that because we

figured the tariff thing would have caused them to do it and by the way i'm not going to do that

with them did the same thing this time if you look at it last time wow we actually nailed the top of

nne we bought the calls end of day yesterday sold them on the pop this morning and now it's all the

way down i might re-enter the same call no it's too soon for me to re-enter the same calls um

but uh but uh no aehr last time we actually had a similar pattern set up uh they actually have

a backlog on their ai stuff right now uh before it went nuts so last time we had earnings we um

we played a dip through the earnings

which was right here it's a big drop bought took the put money and bought calls with it and sold

it up here for like a hundred and something percent actually it actually went up three

hundred percent we didn't catch the top and then it ended up going a thousand percent if you see

here similar kind of set up here right you see this like pop except it had two days of popping

before that drawdown similar kind of thing is setting up here right see how it has that same

kind of drawdown right here i'm not saying the same thing is going to happen but um this was

one of those like drop drawdowns

and then run and so in that case and i'm not a ta person but if we have a similar thing you're

talking about a drop right drawdown run we'll see i've been in ahr since it was three dollars and

fifty cents this is the one that we found during covid because uh we knew that there was a huge

backlog of uh semiconductors and all that shit uh with the supply chain disruption and we needed a

local source for wafers and uh semiconductor parts and and and stuff uh coming out of the

covid because everybody well during covid because everybody was like wanting all that at home stuff

and everybody was this big demand so we realized that that supply chain was disrupted so we found

ahr it was canada doing wafers and so we're like fuck it these guys are probably gonna have a huge

order that they're they're gonna have a thing on because people need it without waiting for to you

know that that overseas shit and we nailed it we ended up getting uh one thousand two hundred

percent on it but we sold on the way up we sold that um i think it was uh uh was it four hundred

percent and six hundred percent a thousand percent and then we back up and we sold it

finally at least we've sold this entire piece of money three hundred and six hundred percent

i would say it's we still with us about three hundred and fifteen and it's probably the best

thing i've had since i've been trading it ever since what google takes sleep should i take if

it's one year out if it's one year out i'd be like closer to the money maybe like 280 but if you're

gonna go extreme blue chip like that i mean i would try to keep it within two percent per month

depending on depending on what the what kind of uh open interest you have and the ask bid so 12 months

I wouldn't go further than $300 calls if it's a year out,

but I'd be more comfortable at $280.

VCIG dead?

Oh, it's gone.

You can't even buy it anymore.

The brokerages aren't letting you fuck with it anymore.

I would love to buy it again, but I can't.

It doesn't even let me trade it anymore,

which sucks because it's like there's still shit that could potentially be in play here,

but it just doesn't want me to play it.

Is there anything else to jump on today?

I don't really see anything.

I can tell Chewy's doing well because my wife hasn't asked about it.

Dpro over $12.

What a fucking insane run.

Three runs of over 100% in a couple months here.

We've played it three times, 100% each.

PLRZ getting a little bit of a love here.

Next is getting some love.

Celsius back to $63.

Not going to look at our calls there.

Still in Venu from the other day.

That's a swing trade for me.

It's a small swing trade, but I'm going to keep that one.

I don't really see anything else I want to fuck with today.

Polestar didn't do so well.

I might start.

I might start legging back into stub again.

I want to wait until $17,

but I think this might actually be a decent place to start legging back in

because we had a huge run on it the last two days.

TSSI, we're still up 9% on.

So I don't want to add to that.

I don't want to average up on that until it hits $19.50.

So otherwise, there's really nothing for me to –

no dips for me to really jump in today.

I'd rather just keep the cash and wait until either today if something else falls

or tomorrow because I don't want to –

for most of my swing trades, it's like I buy every like 3% to 5% down

and most everything is down about 1% to 2%.

Actually, I might – are you okay?

If you need to skip it, skip it.

That GPUS pickup was good.

We'll keep an eye on that.

Actually, you know what I'm going to do?

I'm going to take another play on NNE here share-wise just like I did yesterday.

Where did it go?

Is it still down below 48?

Oh, it's at 46.

Yeah, fuck that.

All right, there we go.

That's what I'm going to do.

I'm going to buy here.

And then just put a stop loss on it and see

because I have money from the calls that we took.

All right, let's go.

Did I get on my Pepsi calls that I had through earnings?

Yeah, got out of that.

It was a pretty decent gain.

I haven't looked at earnings tonight yet.

Which Discord channel do you mainly hang in?

I mean, if I get a chance to, it's in Trader General.

After hours today, Levi's.

I still have my Levi puts.

That play didn't really play out.

Stocky too good for us, DD.

DDTA bros?

No, because the people that hang out in the DDTA channel

are the most fucking pretentious, fucking know-it-all assholes

I've ever met, and they still underperform everyone else.

And I mean that with love.

Like, do your thing.

Like, you know, but it's just like, it's just like,

it's the stock version of crypto bros.

It's insane.

They're just like, if something works that they did research on,

they won't shut up about it.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

Right.

If it doesn't work, they just delete their comments.

And, and it's like, and it's like, yeah.

So what do you think about this?

Well, according to this and that, and this, and this Fibonacci and that piece

and this fundamental, this is where it should go.

Oh, well, it's broken, bro.

It's broke below that level.

Well, that's, it's the market makers that are doing that.

Just, just hold on, brother.

Okay.

Well, well, now we can look at the next setup here and did it.

And it's like, what?

And then like, if somebody questions it, fuck you, newbie, you don't know shit.

You're a fucking piece of shit.

You fucking loser.

How about you go back to DJ and chat and fucking par?

Lay on some stupid fucking UFC midget fighters, some shit like that.

You don't, you don't belong here with the real traders.

And I look at him.

I'm like, motherfucker, we vibe trade and we're outperforming you by six X.

Like, why are you that way?

And then I realized just because they're angry and it's okay.

Why did somebody follow me during that rant?

That is you, sir, or ma'am are, are, are, are exactly who should be here.

All right.

Somebody going to lose their mortgage on APLD today, either because they're going to pick

the wrong direction.

They're going to get IV crushed.

Hover would be good if they had earnings.

Cause that's how most of you guys have to put your hand when you take a picture with

a chick.

Fuck it.

Levi puts it is only cause I'm already in them.

Thoughts on the Helen, uh, discount.

I'm already in it.

Um, bought it earlier.

Um, on the, on the, uh, during Trump talk, probably not the best play, but in this market,

everyone's looking for a dip to buy two days ago.

We had a red day and it gapped completely up yesterday.

Red day tomorrow.

Wouldn't be surprised if we, um, if, uh, if, uh, if, uh, if, uh, if, uh, if, uh, if, uh,

if we, uh, get another gap up tomorrow, just because that's kind of the market we're in

right now.

All right, let's get naked and get out of here.

Anything else I missed today?

We did the historical whiteboard.

We did CRM was such a banger play from yesterday.

This one is just, I'm going to have to see what happens here.

I'm going to stick to it though.

I ain't scared.

I ain't no bitch.

Uh, what, what is the 12 chips mean on the stocky L?

Really don't want to talk about that again.

All right.

Who are we rating today?

Jason, take your shirt off and put.

Just a tie on.

Okay.

First of all, that made me feel dirty.

Okay.

I'm not an object.

Second of all, I don't even know where my fucking ties are.

And third of all, I'm running out of costumes.

I need to get more costumes to pick up the, my daughter, because I did the teenage mutant

turtle one yesterday.

There you go.

I got you, baby.

Let's get out of here.

All right.

Who are we rating today?

Uh, what's, uh, is she, uh, what's her name from yesterday?

What's the thing next to the Microsoft ticker in your port?

Which, what do you mean next to the Microsoft ticker?

Oh, I don't know.

Oh, it must mean I have a thing on it.

I think it just means I have a, I have, somebody's on the wall of shame or something, maybe.

He has gifted a sub to my catheter now.

He just gifted a sub to my catheter.

What?

Okay.

Who are we, uh, oh, it's Mia.

Oh, that's who I'm streaming.

Oh, rating today.

Oh, Jesus.

Fuck.

I'm sorry, Mia.

The TTS messed that one up.

All right.

Are you live?

Wait, there's two people on that stream.

Do both consent?

Do both women consent to this?

Wait.

To the raid.

To the raid.

To the raid.

Yes, sir.

Okay.

New to the stream.

What do you do?

Do you do call-outs and stuff, or do you just talk about the market?

Well, you're going to have to stick around and watch, because no one can answer that

question, what we do here.

Well, I'm sending you to two different, I'm sending you to two girls, one stream.

Okay?

Two girls, one stream.

So, let's, uh, let's do it.

You told us to take risks?

Okay, wait.

Bet this is the first time a girl, what?

I bet this is the first time someone has invited another girl when you, okay, that's just toxic.

Yeah, I'm taking my clothes off.

All right, let's get out of here.

Is there a cup in the picture?

No, guys, don't, just grow up.

Come on.

To my new person.

This is the stream right here.

There you go.

I think, I think that exchange right there explained this stream better than anything

else could.

I'm new here.

Is he getting fully nude, and can we see his cock?

Um, yes?

I mean, sorry, no.

No, but for the right price.

Yes.

All right, let's get out of here.

All right, guys.

Remember, become an organ donor.

It is the greatest gift you could give.

It doesn't cost you a thing.

That's number one.

Number two, if there's somebody you love, somebody you miss, somebody you haven't talked

to in a while, give them a call, give them a text, send them an email, send them a carry

pigeon, let them know you're thinking about them.

You can really make somebody's day, but more importantly, go make your own day.

You got the rest of it.

Make the best of it.

Remember, as long as you've got two healthy kidneys, you are not broke.

Otherwise, I will see you guys tomorrow.

Hasta mañana.

Hasta Thursday.

Mi amigos, mi familia, cabrones, bendecidos y todo.

Gracias por todo.

To my lurkers.

I know you're out there.

You are the best.

You are the backbone of this channel.

Thank you so much for being here each and every day.

And to everybody who gifted, subbed, donated, gave bits, followed, whatever you did, you're

absolute simp, and I don't know why you do it, but I appreciate you.

And to each and every single one of you, thank you for being here and showing up every day.

Let me keep you company, doing whatever it is you're doing.

And remember, as long as you keep coming, I'm going to keep coming too.

All right, baby?

Go tell your mom I said she got a fat ass, and go fuck yourselves.

And as always, stay green, you DJs.
