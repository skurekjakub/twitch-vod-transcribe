## Market Commentary

### Market Conditions
- **Not in bear market** - Would need 20% down from recent high
  - Yesterday's bottom: Only 1.6% down
  - Last bear market: April 2025 (brief), real one was 2022
  - 2022 bear: Down 27%, took almost 2 years to break even

### Bull Market Philosophy
- Market always goes back up unless systemic collapse
- Dollar cost averaging during crashes is opportunity
- S&P 500 flat on year when adjusted for dollar devaluation (both up ~13%)
- More money flowing into market as dollar alternative
- Current market: More participants = higher valuations

### Options Strategy
- Uses options for leverage on large-cap stocks
- Keeps options portfolio small vs trading portfolio
- Prefers shares for speculative stocks (high IV makes options expensive)
- Uses options to free up capital: Risk $400-900 instead of $10k in shares
- Takes close-to-money strikes to limit risk (e.g., $170 calls when stock at $170)

### Brokerage Issues
- Switching from Schwab/ThinkorSwim
- Issue: Order diversion, trailing stop losses default to 1% instead of set percentage
- Has to change orders 3-4 times to get correct percentage

### Pre-market/After-hours Options Trading (if SEC approves)
- Opportunity for smart traders
- Buy low valuation early morning, sell higher as retail wakes up
- Higher premiums for option sellers
- Earnings plays: Buy opposite direction cheap, wait for bounce
- Warning: Inexperienced traders will get crushed on market orders

## Sector Analysis

### Healthcare
- Beaten up, having comeback
- FOMO opportunity for those who missed UNH/$227 bottom, Oscar bottom, etc.
- Average premiums: $27,000/year (rising costs)

### Quantum
- Trump admin considering taking stakes in quantum companies
- Trump announcement scheduled for 3pm
- Narrative shift: Intel → Rare earth → Quantum

## Trading Philosophy

### Risk Management
- "Cowboy trader" - unconventional approach
- Uses trailing stop losses (5-7%)
- Sells early rather than holding for maximum gains
- Legs into positions (buys incrementally)
- Limits options to 1 contract to control risk

### Entry Strategy
- Buys dips on established positions
- Looks for catalysts: Earnings, buybacks, sector rotation, Trump announcements
- Retail psychology: "Quantum in the name" matters for momo plays
- Follows retail market patterns/sentiment

### Exit Strategy
- Takes profits early (100-160% on successful trades)
- Uses trailing stop losses
- Scales out (sold half of Lumen at top, riding rest)

## Insider Trading News - NBA Gambling Scandal
