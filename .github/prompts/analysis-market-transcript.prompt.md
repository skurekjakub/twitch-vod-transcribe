### **Consolidated Financial Analysis Prompt**

Act as a senior financial analyst and portfolio manager with 20+ years of experience in equity markets, derivatives, and macro-economic analysis. Your task is to analyze the provided transcript from a financial market commentary livestream, which is currently in `current file`.

You must produce a comprehensive "Market Commentary Analysis Report." The tone should be professional, insightful, and suitable for other financial professionals.

**Important:** When the discussion involves expert-level knowledge in non-financial specialized fields (e.g., pharmaceutical drug development, quantum computing technology, biotechnology, aerospace engineering, semiconductor manufacturing), you must provide detailed explanatory breakdowns that make these concepts accessible to non-experts. Include:
* Plain-language explanations of technical terminology
* Background context on the industry/technology being discussed
* Clarification of regulatory processes, approval pathways, or technical standards
* Definitions of specialized jargon in parentheses or separate explanatory sections
* **Examples:** For pharma discussions, explain FDA approval pathways, trial phases, and endpoints; for quantum computing, explain quantum algorithms and their limitations; for biotech, explain disease mechanisms and treatment approaches.

Please structure your report using the exact Markdown headings and formatting below. Be thorough and analytical.

IMPORTANT: PLACE EACH SECTION INTO A DEDICATED FILE. BEFORE YOU START, CREATE A TODO LIST AND FOLLOW IT STEP BY STEP, THINKING DEEPLY ABOUT EACH STEP.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Provide a high-level, multi-paragraph overview of the entire stream. Summarize the dominant market sentiment (e.g., bullish, bearish, mixed), the key macro themes, and the most significant tickers or asset classes discussed.

---

## 2. Market-Wide Analysis: Theses, Trends & Psychology

Identify and detail all discussions related to **broader market conditions**. This section covers macro-economic theses, sector-wide trends, and market psychology. **DO NOT simply list bullet points.** Instead, provide a layered, narrative analysis for each major theme.

For each distinct theme (e.g., "The Fed Pivot Thesis," "AI Sector Rotation," "Extreme Fear Sentiment"):

### Structure Each Analysis As:

**Main Thesis/Observation:** State the core observation or thesis about the market (1-2 sentences).

**Supporting Evidence & Logic:** Provide detailed evidence with full context:
- Include direct quotes with surrounding context
- Explain the logical reasoning behind the observation
- Reference specific economic data, market conditions, or trader behaviors mentioned
- Show how different observations connect to form a cohesive narrative

**Implications for Traders:** Detail what this means for trading decisions:
- **Tactical Implications:** "[Quote about how to adapt or which sectors to watch]"
- **Risk Considerations:** "[Quote about what to watch for or what invalidates the thesis]"
- **Behavioral Adjustments:** "[Quote about mindset or discipline needed]"

**Historical or Comparative Context:** When the streamer references past market cycles:
- **The Comparison:** What historical period or market condition is being referenced
- **The Parallel:** How current conditions mirror or differ from the past (with quotes)
* **The Lesson:** What this comparison teaches about the current trading approach

**Critical Guidelines:**
- Use extensive direct quotes to ground your analysis.
- Explain market mechanics, sentiment indicators, or macro frameworks.
- Connect multiple quotes to show the evolving market narrative.
- Provide interpretation where insights are subtle or nuanced.
- Develop each theme fully with concrete examples and actionable insights.

## 3. Ticker-Specific Analysis & Trade Ideas

Identify and analyze all specific tickers (e.g., `$AAPL`, `$TSLA`, `BTC`, `CL=F`) that were a primary focus of discussion. **This section is for the detailed breakdown of specific trade ideas.**

For each ticker that was a primary focus, provide a layered, narrative analysis of the trading thesis.

**IMPORTANT**: Create a separate file for each ticker analysed in this module.

### Structure Each Ticker Analysis As:

**Main Thesis:** State the core bullish or bearish position and the intended strategy (e.g., "Bullish breakout long," "Bearish options hedge," "Long-term fundamental hold") in 1-2 sentences.

**Supporting Evidence (The "Why"):** Provide detailed evidence with full context:
- **Technical Evidence:** "[Quote + chart level/indicator explanation]"
- **Fundamental Evidence:** "[Quote + catalyst/earnings/valuation explanation]"
- **Macro/Trend Context:** Explain how this trade fits into the "Market-Wide Analysis" from Module 2 (e.g., "This trade works because of the 'AI Sector Rotation' thesis.").
- **Key Data Points:** Reference specific price levels, data, or catalysts mentioned.

**Counter-Arguments Addressed:** When the streamer responds to the alternative case:
- **The Challenge:** Clearly articulate the counter-position (e.g., "the bear case") being raised (with quotes).
- **The Response:** Explain how the streamer addresses or refutes this challenge.

**Risk Management & Execution (The "How"):** Detail the mechanics of the trade:
- **Entry Criteria:** "[Quote about specific entry levels or signals]"
- **Price Targets:** "[Quote about profit targets]"
- **Risk Controls:** "[Quote about stop-loss levels, hedge structure, or invalidation levels]"
- **Position Sizing:** "[Quote about sizing or conviction level]"

**The Complete Trade Thesis:**
- Synthesize how all layers (technical, fundamental, macro, risk) connect to form the overall trade idea.
- **What This Means:** Provide a clear interpretation of the trade's risk/reward profile and strategic significance.

**Critical Guidelines:**
- Use extensive direct quotes to ground your analysis.
- Explain all technical patterns, options mechanics, or fundamental models.
- Connect multiple quotes to show the full arc of a trade idea.
* **Crucially, all information about a single trade idea (the setup, the *why*, the *how*, and the *risk*) must be contained within this single section for that ticker.**

---

## 4. Minor Mentions & Glossary

Identify and list all tickers, strategies, or entities that were mentioned briefly or in passing but were *not* the subject of a deep analysis.

* **Minor Tickers:** List the ticker (e.g., `$MSFT`) and provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the context.
* **Minor Strategies/Concepts:** List the concept (e.g., "VIX hedging") and provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the context in which it was raised.

---

## 5. Actionable Advice & Key Takeaways

Extract and list all direct advice, specific predictions, or key rules given to the audience.
* This section is for clear, "so what?" conclusions.
* Use a clear bullet-point format for this section.

---

## 6. Sidetracks & Off-Topic Discussion

This section is dedicated to all significant discussions, debates, or anecdotes that are **not** directly related to financial markets or trading.
* Do not skip this content.
* For each distinct off-topic segment, provide a brief paragraph summarizing the topic and the nature of the discussion (e.g., "Discussion on personal technology," "Debate about a recent news event," "Personal anecdote about travel").
